Based
on the maximum number of shares of divine class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, that divine may be required to issue in the merger, calculated as the product of
(i) 23,633,968, which is the sum of (a) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock, no par value, of eshare communications, Inc. on July 26, 2001 and
(b) the aggregate number of eshare common shares issuable pursuant to outstanding employee and director stock options, multiplied by (ii) the maximum exchange ratio of 3.12 shares of
divine common stock for each eshare common share. 
(2)
Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) and Rule 457(c) under the Securities Act on the basis of
the market value of the eshare common shares to be exchanged in the merger, as the product of (i) $2.335 (the average of the high and low sales prices per eshare common share as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market on July 26, 2001), multiplied by (ii) 23,633,968, which is the estimated maximum number of eshare common shares that may be cancelled in the merger. 
(3)
Each
share of divine class A common stock is accompanied by a series A junior participating preferred stock purchase right that trades with the divine common stock. The value
attributed to those rights, if any, is reflected in the market price of the divine common stock. Prior to the occurrence of certain events, none of which has occurred as of this date, the rights will
not be exercisable or evidenced separately from the divine common stock. 

The Registrant hereby amends this registration statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the Registrant shall file a
further amendment which specifically states that this registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 or until this
registration statement shall become effective on such date as the Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.  

The information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is not an offer to sell, and it is not soliciting any offer to buy, these securities in any state
where the offer or sale is not permitted. 

SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED AUGUST 1, 2001  

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

The Proposed Merger—Your Vote Is Very Important  

    divine, inc. and eshare communications, Inc. have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire eshare in a
stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger in which eshare will be merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. If we complete the merger,
eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine class A common stock for each eshare common share they own. This number will be determined based on the average closing price of
divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. We refer to the result of this calculation as the divine
average closing price. 

    If
the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share
they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653
divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common
stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. If the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the
merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine common stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. The per
share amount of these cash payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. 

    We
will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger until after the dates of the divine and eshare special meetings. divine common stock is
traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DVIN." As of      , 2001, the closing price of divine common stock was $      . Based on this closing price, the exchange
ratio would be      and the maximum number of shares of divine common stock to be issued to eshare shareholders would be      shares, representing approximately
  % of the outstanding common stock of divine after the merger. 
We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares
before making any decision on the merger.

    Please
read carefully the "
Risk Factors
" section beginning on page 19 which discusses the potential risks involved in the
merger, in the operation of the combined company and in owning divine common stock. 

    We
cannot complete the merger unless eshare's shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. In addition, under the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, the
merger will require the approval of divine's stockholders if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger will equal or exceed 20% of the number of shares of divine common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger. We have scheduled special meetings of divine stockholders and eshare shareholders to vote on the merger proposals. If at any time on or prior to the
date of the divine special meeting, divine determines that the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will not require divine stockholder approval, divine
may elect to cancel the divine special meeting, in which case, it will issue a press release to that effect. 

    Whether or not you plan to attend a meeting, we encourage you to take the time to vote. divine stockholders may vote (1) by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card,
(2) by telephone or (3) over the Internet. eshare shareholders may vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating
how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of the proposals and any other proposal properly submitted to stockholders or shareholders at the applicable meeting. So
long as there is a quorum at the divine special meeting, the failure to vote by a divine stockholder will have no effect on the outcome of the vote, but an abstention will have the same effect as a
vote against the proposal. If eshare shareholders do not return their proxy card or abstain, the effect will be a vote against the merger. Returning your proxy card or, in the case of divine
stockholders, voting by telephone or over the Internet, will not affect your right to vote in person if you choose to attend a special meeting.

dates, times and places of the divine stockholder meeting and the eshare shareholder meeting are as follows:

CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE 13, SECTION 1301 ET SEQ. OF THE GEORGIA BUSINESS CORPORATION CODE

iv

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q.
What will happen in the merger?

A.
eshare
will merge into a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine and will cease its separate corporate existence. eshare common shares will be exchanged for divine common stock based on
the exchange ratio. divine stockholders will continue to own their divine common stock.

Q.
What will eshare shareholders receive in the merger?

A.
If
we complete the merger, eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. This number will be based on the average
closing price of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. We refer to the result of this calculation
as the divine average closing price.

•
If
the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own.

•
If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price.

•
If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

As
an example only, if the divine average closing price is $5.00, then eshare shareholders will receive 0.7306 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. Alternatively, if
the divine average closing price is $1.00, eshare shareholders will receive 3.12 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. 

If
the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine common stock otherwise
issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will not pay cash in excess of 50% of
the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. The per share amount of these cash payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. divine will not issue fractional shares. eshare
shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash based on the market value of the fractional share of divine common stock. 

We
urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the merger. 

Q.
What do I need to do now?

A.
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote your shares by completing,
signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope 

as
soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting. divine stockholders may also vote by telephone or over the Internet instead of by mailing their proxy card. The
divine and eshare special meetings will take place on        , 2001. The boards of directors of divine and eshare recommend voting in favor of the proposed merger. 

Q.
How do I vote my divine shares by telephone or over the Internet?

A.
divine
stockholders may vote by telephone or over the Internet instead of by mailing their proxy cards. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have
the control number appearing on your proxy card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the
proxy card by mail. See the instructions on the proxy card for a detailed description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures.

Q.
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A.
Your
broker will only vote your shares if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
vote your shares. If you do not give your broker instructions on how to vote your shares, they will not be voted on the proposed merger. For eshare shareholders, this will have the same effect as
voting against the proposed merger.

Q.
What vote is required to approve the merger?

A.
For
divine, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the divine special meeting is required to approve the issuance of divine common stock in the merger. For eshare,
the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding eshare common shares is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.

Q.
Why is divine calling a special meeting?

A.
Under
the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, the merger will require the approval of the divine stockholders if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the
merger will equal or exceed 20% of the number of shares of divine common stock outstanding immediately before the merger. We will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock to be
issued in the merger until after the dates of the special meetings. However, if at any time on or before the date of the divine special meeting, divine determines that the number of shares of divine
common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will not require divine stockholder approval under the rules of the Nasdaq National Market,
divine may elect to cancel the divine stockholder meeting, in which case, it will issue a press release to that effect.

Q.
Will I be able to change my vote?

A.
Yes.
If you are a stockholder or shareholder of record you may change your vote in any of the following ways:

•
by
sending a written notice to the secretary of either divine or eshare, as applicable, prior to the special meeting, stating that you would like to revoke
your proxy; 

•
by
completing, signing and dating another proxy card and returning it by mail prior to the special meeting;

•
by
telephone or via the Internet, if you are a divine stockholder, by following the instructions provided on your proxy card; or

•
by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, including under the divine employee stock purchase plan, and you have directed that person to vote your shares, you must
instruct that person if you want to change your vote. 

Q.
Should eshare shareholders send in their share certificates now?

A.
No.
After the merger is completed, the exchange agent will send eshare shareholders written instructions for exchanging their share certificates for divine common stock.

Q.
Who is the exchange agent?

A.
Computershare
Investor Services, LLC is the exchange agent.

Q.
What if I don't vote by proxy or at the special meeting or I abstain?

A.
If
an eshare shareholder fails to respond by sending in his, her or its proxy card and fails to vote at the eshare special meeting, or sends in his, her or its proxy card and
abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposed merger and the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan. Assuming there will be a quorum at the divine
special meeting, a divine stockholder's failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the voting, while an abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. If either
an eshare shareholder or a divine stockholder sends in his, her or its executed proxy card but does not indicate how he, she or it wants to vote, the proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the
merger and, for an eshare shareholder, in favor of the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan.

Q.
When do you expect to complete the merger?

A.
We
expect to complete the merger shortly after the special meetings.

Q.
What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A.
eshare
shareholders generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of eshare common shares, except to the extent any cash is paid by
divine as part of the merger consideration or for fractional shares. To review the tax consequences to eshare shareholders in greater detail, see "The Merger—United States Federal Income
Tax Consequences" beginning on page 73. The tax consequences to each particular eshare shareholder will depend on that shareholder's specific situation. Therefore, each eshare shareholder
should consult his, her or its own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences to that shareholder resulting from the merger. 

Q.
What will happen if the merger is not completed?

A.
If
the merger is not completed for any reason, both divine and eshare may be subject to a number of material risks. For example, under the terms of the merger agreement, either
party may be required under limited circumstances to pay the other party a termination fee of $2,000,000. In addition, significant merger-related costs incurred by divine and eshare, such as legal,
accounting and financial advisor fees, must be paid by the parties even if the merger is not completed. Also, the prices of divine common stock and eshare common shares may decline to the extent that
their current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.

Q.
Why are eshare shareholders being asked to approve the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan?

A.
The
eshare employee stock purchase plan will not be assumed by divine in the merger. However, eshare shareholder approval of an amendment to this plan is being sought by the eshare
board of directors in order to ratify a previous increase in the total number of shares available for purchase under the plan from 250,000 to 301,760 in accordance with the requirements of Section 423
of the Internal Revenue Code.

Q.
What is the difference between divine's class A common stock and class C common stock?

A.
divine's
class A common stock is registered with the SEC and publicly traded on the Nasdaq National Market. divine's class C common stock is identical to the
class A common stock, except that it does not have voting rights and is convertible into an equal number of shares of divine's class A common stock. divine's class C common stock
is held by only one owner and is not registered with the SEC. In the merger, eshare shareholders will receive divine's class A common stock and the associated rights to purchase divine's
series A junior participating preferred stock under divine's stockholder rights plan. All references to divine common stock in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are to divine's
class A common stock and the associated preferred stock purchase rights.

Q.
What if I have additional questions?

A.
If
you have any additional questions about the merger or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy
card, you should contact one of the following:

have approved the merger. Either of divine or eshare can also terminate the merger agreement if:

days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which notice of termination is given.

number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of eshare common shares underlying the stock option multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price for these stock options will be
equal to the current exercise price divided by the exchange ratio. Each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price above the result of the divine closing price on the date immediately
prior to the closing date of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio will be cancelled. 

Voting Agreement (page 71)  

    divine has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive
officer of eshare. Under the voting agreement, Szlam Partners has granted divine the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger
agreement and the merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to this agreement represented approximately  % of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the
eshare special meeting. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (page 71)  

    eshare shareholders and divine stockholders should be aware that certain members of the eshare and divine boards of directors and management have interests in
the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other eshare shareholders and divine stockholders. In particular: 

    The Stockholder Agreement.
  divine and Szlam Partners, along with Aleksander Szlam, entered into a stockholder agreement
under which (1) divine granted Szlam Partners the right to sell to divine a number of shares of divine common stock at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price,
(2) Szlam Partners granted divine the right to purchase from Szlam Partners a number of shares of divine common stock at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price,
and (3) Szlam Partners agreed to 

restrictions on its right to transfer shares of divine common stock, other than as described above, for a period of twelve months, in each case following consummation of the merger. 

    The Employment Agreement.
  Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine and Mr. Szlam agreed to enter into an
employment agreement simultaneously with the closing of the merger. The terms of the employment agreement provide that Mr. Szlam will be employed by divine for an initial three-year
term as chief strategy officer and president—CIM businesses and will receive a salary of $400,000 per year and a bonus of up to $600,000 per year subject to approval of the compensation
committee of divine's board of directors. divine has also agreed to appoint Mr. Szlam to its board of directors and nominate him to continue as a director at its 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders. Mr. Szlam's employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions and prohibits Mr. Szlam from competing against the combined
entity during the term of the agreement and for a period of three years after the termination of the agreement. 

    The Real Estate Option Agreement.
  Szlam Partners and Melita House, Inc., a corporation owned by
Mr. Szlam, own the properties at which eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom headquarters,
respectively, are located. Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine agreed to enter into a real estate option agreement with Szlam Partners and Melita House upon the closing of the merger under
which divine will pay Szlam Partners $3,702,978 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's property in the U.S. for $14,560,000, and pay Melita House $2,047,022 for a ten-year
option to purchase eshare's property in the U.K. for £5,714,668. Under the real estate option agreement, Szlam Partners and Melita House will agree not to raise the rental amounts due
under, or otherwise adversely modify, the leases for these properties so long as the surviving company is not in default under the leases. 

    divine Interested Director Ownership.
  Andrew J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is also
a director of eshare. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned      eshare common shares, representing approximately    % of the total eshare common
shares outstanding as of the record date. 

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing of the
merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting eshare's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under eshare's articles of
incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by
eshare's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to expend more than 150% of the annual
premium paid by eshare for that coverage as of the date of the merger agreement. 

    Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase eshare common shares under eshare's stock option plans will
accelerate upon the completion of the merger. As of the record date, eshare directors and executive officers held options to purchase an aggregate of       eshare common shares that would
be assumed by divine in the merger. 

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 73)  

    eshare shareholders generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on their exchange of eshare common shares, except to the
extent they receive cash 

as part of the merger consideration or for fractional shares. To review the tax consequences to eshare shareholders in greater detail, see "The Merger—United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences" beginning on page 73. The tax consequences to each particular eshare shareholder will depend on his, her or its specific situation. Therefore, each eshare shareholder should
consult his, her or its own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences resulting from the merger. 

Accounting Treatment (page 77)  

    divine will account for the merger using the purchase method for financial reporting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Regulatory Matters (page 77)  

    eshare's and divine's obligations to complete the merger are subject to their receipt of all necessary approvals and the expiration of all applicable waiting
periods required by U.S. laws. divine and eshare have made filings and taken other actions, and will continue to take actions, needed to obtain approvals from all appropriate authorities, including
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. 

divine's Recent Developments (page 98)  

    Since April 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of acquisitions to further its business strategy. 

    On
April 2, 2001, divine acquired certain assets from marchFIRST, Inc., including primarily its former Whittman-Hart operations and its iCampus training and
technology unit, and related accounts receivable with a face value of approximately $35.18 million. The acquired business is held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine called
divine/Whittman-Hart, Inc., which provides a range of enterprise technology, hosting, e-business strategy and brand-building services. divine paid marchFIRST
approximately $6.25 million in cash, and divine/Whittman-Hart issued marchFIRST a $27.75 million balloon note, secured by the assets of divine/Whittman-Hart, that
is payable in five years, subject to acceleration to the extent of 50% of free cash flow from its operations. divine/Whittman-Hart also agreed to assume up to $10.65 million of accrued
compensation and benefit obligations for the employees transferred with the acquired businesses. The promissory note is not guaranteed by divine, but the terms of the promissory
note restrict payments from divine/Whittman-Hart to divine. marchFIRST also is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $39.05 million in bonus payments of 50% of free cash flow
from divine/Whittman-Hart during the next five years to the extent the promissory note is pre-paid. 

    In
a separate transaction, on April 12, 2001, divine/Whittman-Hart acquired additional assets from marchFIRST, including its SAP software implementation practice, its
value-added reseller (VAR) business, certain of its Asian joint ventures, the assets of its BlueVector venture capital arm and related accounts receivable with a face value of approximately
$109.2 million. divine paid marchFIRST $6.25 million in cash, and divine/Whittman-Hart issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $29.75 million, assumed up
to $3.65 million of accrued compensation and benefit obligations for transferred employees, and agreed to make bonus payments up to a maximum amount of $15.95 million. The terms of the
promissory note and bonus obligation are similar to those granted by divine/Whittman- 

Hart in its purchase of marchFIRST's former Whittman-Hart operations and its iCampus unit. 

    The
acquired marchFIRST operations include customer relationship management, e-commerce strategy and development, knowledge management and business intelligence, supply
chain and business systems, infrastructure planning and brand and market development solutions. 

    On
July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc. RoweCom is a business-to-business provider of
e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing print and e-content knowledge resources, including magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other
printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical;
academia and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, each of the approximately 12.5 million outstanding shares of
RoweCom common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.75 shares of divine common stock, and RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. Based on the closing price of divine
common stock of $             on             , 2001, this acquisition would have an aggregate value of approximately
$       million. Completion of the RoweCom merger is
subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. divine
anticipates that RoweCom's content offerings and procurement technology will be key components of divine's enterprise portal solutions and international expansion. 

    On
July 18, 2001, divine acquired the 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of 13.8 million
shares of divine common stock. divine has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 on or before September 1, 2001 to register these shares for resale. Emicom had been an
associated company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33% interest in it. Emicom is a technology holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage
technology companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately held technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets.
At the time of the acquisition, Emicom held interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will
provide divine with a base of operations in the Israeli high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and
Europe. 

    On
July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court approval. Intira provides information
technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine will purchase substantially all of the
assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume certain obligations which divine intends to restructure on
more favorable terms. The acquisition of the Intira assets is expected to add to divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications business unit and to provide opportunities for divine's other
business units.

Unaudited Selected Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information  

    In addition to the pending merger between divine and eshare, on July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization
with RoweCom Inc., a business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing print and e-content knowledge resources, including magazines,
newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a
number of conditions, including the approval of the merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. The following unaudited
selected pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the acquisition of eshare alone as well as the acquisitions of eshare and RoweCom together. 

    Because
the pro forma financial information is based upon the financial condition and operating results of eshare and RoweCom during periods when they were not under the control,
influence or management of divine, the information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods
presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any synergies that may occur
due to the integration of eshare and RoweCom with divine. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical financial
statements of divine, including the related notes, incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the historical financial statements of eshare, including the related notes
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Comparative Stock Price Information  

    The following table sets forth the last sale prices per share of eshare common shares and divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on July 6,
2001, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed merger, and on July 30, 2001, the most recent date for which prices were practically available prior to the date of
this document. The table also sets forth the value of the divine common stock that an eshare shareholder would have received for one eshare common share, assuming that the merger had taken place on
those dates, and assuming that divine had not elected to pay any portion of the merger consideration in cash, other than for fractional shares. These numbers have been calculated by multiplying the
last sale price per share of divine common stock on those dates by the adjusted exchange ratio. The actual value of the divine common stock that an eshare
shareholder will receive on the date of the merger may be higher or lower than the prices set forth below. 
We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common
stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the merger.

RISK FACTORS    

    In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the
following factors in evaluating the proposals to be voted on at your special meeting and the acquisition by the eshare shareholders of divine common stock. For periods following the merger, we have
assumed the consummation of the RoweCom merger. References to the products, businesses, financial results or financial condition of divine and eshare mean our combined enterprise and its subsidiaries,
including RoweCom. We have separated the risks into three groups: risks relating to the proposed merger, risks relating to the combined entity and risks relating to ownership of divine common stock.
References to "we," "us" and "our" in "—Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger" refer to the combined divine/eshare entity following the completion of the merger. References to "we," "us"
and "our" in "—Risks Relating to the Combined Entity" and "—Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock" refer to the combined divine/eshare/RoweCom entity following
completion of the merger. 

Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger  

We may be unable to successfully integrate our operations and personnel and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the proposed merger.  

    This merger requires the integration of our companies, which have previously operated independently. We may not accomplish this integration smoothly, quickly,
successfully, or at all. The successful combination of the companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense. divine and eshare have different systems and procedures in
many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated. Integration also may be difficult because divine is based in Chicago, Illinois and eshare is based in Norcross, Georgia. This
integration may be further complicated by the possible simultaneous integration of RoweCom's operations. While we integrate operations, management may be distracted, and employee uncertainty and lack
of focus may disrupt our normal operations. As often occurs
with mergers of technology/services companies, during the pre-merger and integration phases, competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key employees. Employee uncertainty
regarding the effects of the merger could also increase turnover. Failure to quickly and effectively accomplish the integration of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to successfully integrate or cross-sell our products and technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of the proposed
merger.  

    We will need to integrate our product development operations, technologies and products. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable because divine's
and eshare's products are highly complex and were developed independently and without regard to this integration. Successful integration will also require coordination of previously independent
development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. In addition, this integration may take longer than expected, and we may need to expend more resources on
integration than we anticipated. The need to expend additional time and money on our integration would reduce the resources that would otherwise be available to develop new products and technologies.
If we cannot integrate our products and technologies successfully on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected benefits of the merger. 

Our customers may react unfavorably to the merger, which could negatively affect our results of operations.  

    The merger may disrupt our customer relationships. Uncertainty regarding the merger and our ability to effectively integrate our operations without a
significant reduction in the quality of product and service offerings may also cause some of our customers to explore alternatives. Further, customers may defer making purchasing decisions as they
evaluate the likelihood of our successful integration. Any significant delay or loss of business from significant customers could have a negative effect on our results of operations. 

The amount and type of consideration that eshare shareholders will receive in the merger may not be finalized until after the date of the eshare and divine
special meetings.  

    The number of shares of divine common stock that eshare shareholders will receive at the closing of the merger may increase or decrease pursuant to the
exchange ratio, which is tied to fluctuations in the market price of divine common stock. Furthermore, if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger pursuant to the
exchange ratio exceeds 28,546,506, divine may elect to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the shares issuable in excess of 28,546,506 shares. Accordingly, the amount and type of consideration
to be received by eshare shareholders in the merger may not be settled as of the dates of the special meetings and will depend on the market price of divine common stock in the days leading up to the
closing of the merger and divine's decision as to whether to pay cash in lieu of a portion of the shares of its common stock. Historically, the market price of both divine common stock and eshare
common shares has been volatile. We have included the market prices of divine common stock and eshare common shares as of a recent date under the caption "Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial
Data—Comparative Stock Price Information" beginning on page 17. However, we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or eshare common shares will be at
any time. We, therefore, urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the merger. 

Officers and directors of eshare have potential conflicts of interest in the merger.  

    Certain of eshare's officers and directors have employment and other agreements and/or benefit plans that provide them with interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, interests of eshare shareholders. These interests, which include acceleration of vesting of stock options, severance benefits and an employment agreement with
Aleksander Szlam, are described in more detail under the caption "The Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 71. 

After the merger, shareholders of eshare will have different shareholder rights that may be less advantageous than their current rights.  

    Upon consummation of the merger, eshare shareholders will become divine stockholders. Differences in eshare's amended and restated articles of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws and divine's third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, as well as differences in Delaware and Georgia law
and divine's stockholder rights plan, will result in changes to the rights of eshare shareholders when they become divine stockholders. See "Comparison of Rights of divine Stockholders and eshare
Shareholders" beginning on page 127. 

Risks Relating to the Combined Entity  

divine has been in business for only two years, has little operating history and has a new business strategy that may continue to change, which makes it
difficult to evaluate its business.  

    divine was formed in May 1999 and began operations as an Internet holding company engaged in business-to-business
e-commerce through a community of associated companies. divine announced a new strategy to focus on enterprise Web solutions in February 2001. Because divine has only recently begun
operating under this new business strategy, there is limited data upon which you can evaluate its prospects. As we continue to analyze business plans and internal operations in light of market
developments, we may decide to make further substantial changes in our business plan and organization. These changes in business strategy may include moving into areas in which divine has little or no
experience. Furthermore, our future business strategy will depend on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses as we continue to seek to expand our portfolio of products and
services. We are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies, and it will continue to be difficult to evaluate
our business and its likelihood of success. 

Our overall performance and quarterly operating results will be affected by the revenues generated from eshare's and RoweCom's products and services and will
be affected by fluctuations in the sales of these products and services.  

    We expect eshare's and RoweCom's revenues to comprise a significant portion of our revenues in the future. In particular, we expect RoweCom's revenues to
represent a significant portion of our revenues because RoweCom historically has recognized as revenue its cost of the knowledge resource it sells plus the fee retained by RoweCom. In addition,
RoweCom has historically experienced seasonal fluctuation in revenues because substantially all of its revenues have been generated in the fourth quarter of each year, when most subscriptions are
purchased or renewed by RoweCom's customers. Fluctuations in the revenue generated from our offering of CIM solutions and knowledge resources will likely impact our overall performance, and risks
relating to our CIM solutions and knowledge resources may affect our success as a whole. 

    Moreover,
divine's, eshare's and RoweCom's revenues and results of operations have varied substantially from quarter to quarter. We expect large fluctuations in our future quarterly
operating results due to a number of factors, including: 

•
the
success of, and costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships;

•
losses
or charges incurred by associated companies that may include significant write-downs, write-offs and impairment charges;

•
the
level of product and price competition;

•
the
length of our sales and implementation process;

•
the
size and timing of individual transactions;

•
seasonal
trends;

•
the
mix of products and services sold; 

•
software
defects and other product quality problems;

•
the
timing of new product introductions and enhancements by divine, eshare, RoweCom or their competitors;

•
customer
order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products to be offered by divine, eshare, RoweCom or their competitors;

•
changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•
customers'
fiscal constraints; and

•
general
economic conditions. 

We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable.  

    divine incurred net losses of approximately $9,407,000 for the period from inception on May 7, 1999 through December 31, 1999, approximately
$470,319,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $65,587,000 for the three-months ended March 31, 2001. The majority of these losses were related to the consolidated
operations of divine's associated companies and charges divine took to reduce the carrying value of these associated companies. We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Our
financial results will continue to be affected by the operations of our associated companies, some of which may cease operations in the future if they are unable to generate positive cash flow.
Furthermore, we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to implement our current business strategy and integrate acquired
businesses. Changes to our business strategy and product lines may also cause us to incur additional expenses. To the extent that revenues do not increase at a sufficient rate, we may not be able to
achieve and maintain profitability. 

If we do not successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be
impaired.  

    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of other businesses that are complementary to ours, including other providers of enterprise software products or
professional services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisitions or successfully integrate any acquired
businesses into our operations. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 

•
diversion
of management's attention;

•
assimilation
of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;

•
incorporation
of acquired products into existing product lines;

•
adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results;

•
assumption
of the liabilities of acquired companies;

•
possible
loss of key employees; and

•
difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image. 

    If
we engage in future acquisitions, we might finance these acquisitions with available cash, the proceeds from possible debt financing or the issuance of additional equity securities
(common or preferred stock), or a combination of the foregoing. We may not be able to 

arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. If we proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions, we may use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions.
If we consummate one or more significant acquisitions by issuing additional equity securities, the market price of our common stock could decline and stockholders could suffer significant dilution of
their interests in us. Furthermore, sellers may be reluctant to accept divine common stock as consideration at its recent price level and given its historical volatility, in which case, our ability to
complete further acquisitions could be significantly limited. 

    For
most of the businesses that we may acquire, we will likely have to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and generally accepted accounting principles may
require us to recognize substantial amortization charges on the other intangible assets, reducing our future reportable earnings. Additionally, we will have to periodically test our goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment. If we determine that the value of the goodwill and/or the intangible assets have been impaired, we would be required to recognize substantial charges that would
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these acquisitions could involve non-recurring acquisition-related charges, such as the write-off or write-down
of software development costs or other intangible items. 

    The
RoweCom transaction remains subject to a number of conditions, including its approval by RoweCom stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and
its subsidiaries. The RoweCom merger may not be completed if the conditions to closing are not satisfied or waived. Furthermore, if the RoweCom merger is completed, one of the key elements of
RoweCom's strategy will be to continue to expand its catalog of knowledge resources. RoweCom gains content through acquisitions, strategic alliances and contacts with various publishers as RoweCom
receives particular requests from clients. RoweCom may not be able to continue to gain available content through acquisitions, strategic alliances or directly from publishers. 

Our failure to retain key personnel may negatively affect our business.  

    Our success depends on our ability to retain senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement, development and support
of our products and services and ongoing sales and marketing efforts. The loss of any key personnel or any significant group of employees could negatively affect our future business and prospects. If
our management does not succeed in their roles, or we are not able to effectively allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as a group, our
business could be negatively affected. 

    Employee
morale and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees may also be adversely affected by the decline and substantial fluctuation in the market price of divine
common stock since its initial public offering, as many divine employees hold options with exercise prices far higher than divine's recent stock price. 

Revenues from our professional services division are difficult to predict because they are derived from project-based engagements.  

    We derive almost all of the revenues of our professional services division from project-based client engagements, which vary in size and scope. As a result,
the revenues of our professional services division are difficult to predict because a client that accounts for a significant portion of these revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount
of 

revenues, if any, in subsequent periods. In addition, because many of our professional services engagements involve sequential stages, each of which may represent a separate contractual commitment, a
client may choose not to retain us for subsequent stages of an engagement or for new professional services projects. 

If we cannot keep our billable professionals engaged on client projects, our future revenues could decline and our operating results could be adversely
affected.  

    Virtually all the client contracts of our professional services division allow the client to terminate our services on relatively short notice and do not
guarantee us any specific or minimum amount of business from the client. To the extent that any significant clients decrease their use of our professional services, delay an engagement or terminate
their relationship with us, the revenues of our professional services division could decline substantially and our overall operating results could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to
quickly redeploy our billable professionals to other client engagements. 

We may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our competitors.  

    The market for our products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. As a result of this merger and the RoweCom
transaction, we will compete with a variety of companies that provide software solutions and professional services independently or on an integrated basis. We may not be able to compete successfully
against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial results. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do. 

    eshare's
primary competitors in the field of integrated inbound/outbound telephony-based call management systems have been Davox Corporation, SER Systeme AG (formerly EIS
International, Inc.) and Avaya, Inc. (formerly Mosaix International, Inc.) We will continue to
compete primarily against Davox and Avaya in the collections segment of the outbound call management systems market, and against SER Systeme in the telemarketing and telesales segments of the
inbound/outbound call management systems market. We will also compete in the computer telephony integration segment of the market, where principal competitors include Interactive Intelligence, Inc.,
Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel, and Stratasoft Corp., Apropos Technology, Castel, Inc. and CellIT, Inc., among others. In the future, we may also face additional direct competition
from private branch exchange/automatic call distribution vendors, other telecommunications equipment providers, telecommunications service providers, computer hardware and software vendors and others.
Furthermore, in the Internet-based CIM industry, our competitors will include eGain Communications Corporation, Kana Software, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Face Time Communications, Inc., LivePerson,
Inc., People Support, Inc. and Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    divine
competes in various market segments that are extremely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. While we offer an increasingly comprehensive range of
advanced enterprise solutions, we compete with various providers of one or more components of our solutions. In the enterprise portal software and services segment, according to Delphi Research and
the Yankee Group, the leading portal application makers in 2000 included: Plumtree Software, Inc., Hummingbird Ltd., Viador Inc., Sequoia Software Corporation (acquired by Citrix Systems, Inc.) and
InfoImage, Inc., among others. We believe 

that additional competitors in the broader advanced enterprise solutions market include: IBM Corporation, PeopleSoft, Inc., BEA Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Sybase, Inc., Oracle Corporation,
Computer Associates International, Inc., Epicentric, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Vignette Corporation, Citrix Systems, Inc., Open Text Corporation, Top Tier Software, Inc., DataChannel, Inc., Tibco
Software Inc., SAP AG, American Express Company and InfoSys Consulting Inc. 

    Although
RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with
comparable management control features, Ebsco Information Services has recently announced its intent to launch a desktop e-commerce service, similar to RoweCom's kStore in the near future.
Thus, we expect that significant competition will develop in the near future with respect to RoweCom's knowledge resource services, and it may have an adverse impact on our business. 

If we do not expand our customer base, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely decline.  

    The market for many of our products and services is newly emerging. As a result, we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for them. We believe that
market acceptance of many of our products and services will depend principally on our ability to: 

•
timely
develop or acquire products and services that meet changing customer needs;

•
effectively
market our products and services;

•
hire,
train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel;

•
provide
high-quality and reliable customer support for our products;

•
distribute
and price our products and services in a manner that is more appealing to customers than that of our competitors;

•
develop
a favorable reputation among our customers, potential customers and participants in the software industry; and

•
withstand
downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that would slow corporate spending on software products and professional services. 

    Furthermore,
the adoption of networks for book and subscription procurement, particularly by companies that have relied on traditional means of procurement, will require broad
acceptance of the new approach. In addition, companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of procurement may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy. This could limit
the growth of our revenues derived from the RoweCom merger. 

    Some
of the foregoing factors are beyond our control, and any one or more of them may limit our ability to expand our customer base. If our customer base does not expand, we may never
become profitable and our stock price will likely decline. 

Our success is dependent upon the market for Internet services, which, along with the general economy, is experiencing a downturn.  

    During late 2000 and 2001, the market for Internet services and technology experienced a significant decline. This decline is at least partly attributable to
funding difficulties experienced by many companies and a general economic slowdown. Both developments have 

caused many of our current and potential customers and clients to cancel, reduce and/or delay some projects. If demand for our products and services does not improve, increased competition for
business may result in significant decreases in the prices we charge for our products and services. A prolonged economic slowdown or continued uncertainty about the future of the market for Internet
services will also adversely affect our business and financial results. The market for our products and services may not improve in a timely manner or to the extent necessary to allow us to achieve
and sustain profitability in the near future. 

Our success will depend upon the ability of our software products to work with a large variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems.  

    The success of our products will depend on various factors, including the ability of our products to integrate and be compatible with customer systems,
particularly hardware systems, operating systems and data sources, as well as or better than competing products. The success of our software products will also depend on the ability of our products to
work well with one another, with new products we are developing and with new software being developed by third parties. Also, we currently serve, and intend to continue to serve, a customer base with
a wide variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems. To gain broad market acceptance, we believe that we will need to support an increasing number of systems in the future. 

Customers will be less likely to accept our products if we are unable to introduce in a timely manner new software products and enhancements that meet industry
requirements.  

    The market for our software products is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving
industry standards that may render our existing products and services obsolete. As a result, unforeseen changes in customer and technological requirements for application features, functions and
technologies could limit our ability to develop market share or could rapidly erode our position in those markets in which we have an established presence. Our growth and future operating results will
depend in part upon our ability to develop and introduce new applications that anticipate, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer requirements, respond to
competitive products and achieve market acceptance. 

    New
products, platforms and language support typically require long development and testing periods. New products or enhancements may not be released according to schedule or may
contain defects when released. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our
business. Our product acquisition, development and testing efforts have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments. We may not possess sufficient resources to make
these necessary investments. 

    We
also expect to develop and introduce new and enhanced versions of products as an integrated suite. In addition to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development and
introduction of new products, we will face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products and versions that work together effectively and allow customers to achieve the benefits of
a broader product offering. We may not be able to identify or overcome these challenges. 

    After
the merger and the RoweCom transaction, we intend to offer the products and services of eshare and RoweCom to existing divine customers and divine's products to existing 

eshare and RoweCom customers. These customers may not have an interest in these other products and services. If we fail to cross-market our products and services, we will not achieve one of the
expected benefits of the merger and the RoweCom transaction, and this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

Our future revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if the software application industry continues to evolve toward a subscription-based model.  

    We expect our revenue growth rates and operating results to be adversely affected as customers require us to offer our products under a subscription-based
application service provider model. We currently sell software application solutions on a perpetual license basis in exchange for an up-front license fee. Many of our customers are
attempting to reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer subscribes to
use an application from the software provider. Generally, the application is hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third-party hosting service. We expect that subscription-based
revenues will represent a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our software applications division and our managed applications division. 

    Under
the subscription-based model, we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription. As a result, our revenue growth rate
under a subscription model may be less than what our revenue growth rate would be under a license model. In addition, the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the
subscription agreement. If we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription
may exceed the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we are not successful in implementing the
subscription-based model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our existing license model, our business could be impaired and our stock price
could decline. 

Our business may be adversely affected if there are defects in our software or we are unable to acquire third-party software or hardware that is
error-free.  

    Software products as complex as those that we offer may contain errors that could occur at any point in a product's life cycle. divine and eshare have, in the
past, discovered software errors in certain of their products and have experienced delays in shipment or implementation of products during the period required to correct these errors. Despite
extensive testing by us and by our current and potential customers, errors in our software may be found in the future. This could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance and sales,
diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty cost. In particular, the call center environment is characterized by a wide variety of standard and
non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming and will limit our ability to uncover all
defects prior to shipment and installation at a customer's location. We also license certain software used in our products from third parties, and our products are designed to operate on certain
hardware platforms manufactured by third parties. Third-party software or hardware may contain errors that we are dependent upon others to correct. These errors could cause problems with the
installation and operation of our products, which could harm our business. 

We may face potential liability to customers if our products or our customers' systems fail.  

    Our software, portal and applications products are often critical to the operation of our customers' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to
quantify. If a product of ours or a customer's system fails, the customer could make a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The limitations of
liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances and may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on
reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we experience one or more large claims against
us that exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements,
our business and financial results could be hurt. 

We could lose our competitive advantage if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and any related litigation could be costly and time consuming.  

    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights in our products and technology. These measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. As a result, unauthorized third parties may copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We may also not be able to detect all instances of infringement. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions
in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in these countries. If we must engage in litigation to
defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, either domestically or in other countries, we could face substantial costs and diversion of resources, regardless of the outcome of such
litigation. Any future attempt by us to enforce our intellectual property rights might not be successful, or might result in royalties that do not exceed the cost of such enforcement efforts. Even if
we succeed in protecting our intellectual property, others may independently develop similar technologies or products that do not infringe on our intellectual property. 

Other companies may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.  

    Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expect that the risk of infringement claims will rise as the number of
products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. To develop our services and products, we may need to acquire licenses for
intellectual property to avoid infringement of a third party's product. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Former employers of our present and future
employees may assert claims that these employees improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us. Any such claims could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation,
divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements may
not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar
technology, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

Online security breaches could harm our business.  

    A party that is able to circumvent our security systems or the security systems of our customers could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. Security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and exclusions that
may prevent reimbursement for losses caused by security breaches. Furthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Despite these efforts, we may not be able
to prevent all security breaches. 

Future government regulation could place financial burdens on our business.  

    Because of the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations may be adopted that could have an adverse effect on us. In particular, states
may impose discriminatory, multiple or special taxes on the Internet if the current moratorium on the application of these taxes, due to end on October 21, 2001, is not extended. If the
moratorium ends, federal taxes may also be imposed on the use of the Internet. These state and federal taxes could cause a decrease in the volume of e-commerce and, therefore, the demand
for our products and services. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, including international laws and regulations, could impede the growth of the Internet and e-commerce,
which could decrease our revenue and place additional financial burdens on our business. 

    Federal,
state or foreign agencies have also adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of outbound call processing systems. These laws or regulations
could limit the market for our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. It is possible that these laws or regulations could expose
companies involved in outbound call processing systems to liability, which could adversely affect our business. 

    If we lost the services of Andrew J. Filipowski, our business could fail.  

    We believe that Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, is critical to our success. If we lost the services of Mr. Filipowski,
our ability to promote our business and raise additional capital would be severely limited, and our business could fail. We do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Filipowski. 

    Our key personnel have entered into non-compete agreements that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities and
acquiring interests in some companies.  

    Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer; Michael P. Cullinane, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer and a
director; and Paul L. Humenansky, our president and chief operating officer and a director, have entered into consulting and non-compete agreements with PLATINUM 

technology
 International, 
inc.
, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates
International, Inc. These agreements prohibit Mr. Filipowski until June 29, 2007, and each of Messrs. Cullinane and Humenansky until June 29, 2004, from
participating or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the development, manufacture, marketing or distribution of any products or services offered by PLATINUM as 

of March 29, 1999, or any products or services offered by PLATINUM after that date and in which they had actively participated. PLATINUM was, as of March 29, 1999, and continues to be,
engaged in the business of developing, marketing and supporting software products for managing information technology infrastructures and providing related professional services. As of
March 29, 1999, PLATINUM also offered products and services for the creation, deployment and management of Web content. 

    Under
the agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky also are prohibited from soliciting, or assisting another person to solicit or attempt to solicit, persons or
entities that were current customers of PLATINUM or its affiliates before the end of the respective employment periods of Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky, unless the solicitation
of these customers is for goods or services unrelated to any activity which competes with PLATINUM. 

    To
manage divine's business effectively in light of these agreements, divine has consulted with PLATINUM and Computer Associates before making any acquisition to confirm that a
breach of these agreements would not result. PLATINUM and Computer Associates have consented to the merger and the RoweCom transaction. In the future, however, these consulting and
non-compete agreements could limit our business opportunities, which could impair our success. 

    Delays in sales and the implementation cycle for CIM solutions and managed applications could adversely affect us.  

    If we experience delays in, or cancellations of, sales or implementations of CIM solutions and managed applications, our business and financial results could
be hurt. To sell these products, we generally must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding their use and benefits. In addition, prospective customers generally make
a significant commitment of resources in connection with the implementation of these products. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential
customer and the installation and use of these solutions has generally been six months or more. Our implementation cycle could be lengthened in the future by delays over which we have little or no
control, increases in the size and complexity of our installations and the number of third-party systems with which our products must be integrated. In addition, any unexpected delays in individual
implementations could generate negative publicity and expose us to liability claims from our customers. 

    eshare's operating results have been substantially dependent on a limited suite of products and the market for call center and
Internet-based CIM solutions.  

    eshare traditionally has derived a majority of its revenues from sales of its Conversations call center management product, its NetAgent
Web-collaboration product and related services and support. eshare introduced Conversations in 1999 and NetAgent in 1998. eshare is currently in the process of developing next generation
CIM applications and expects to begin beta trials in 2001. In the near term, we anticipate that a significant portion of our eshare-related revenue may be derived from eshare's Conversations and
NetAgent product offerings and related services and support. We intend to enhance these products and develop market specific solutions. However, any factor adversely affecting the market for call
center and Internet-based solutions in general, or the Conversations and NetAgent products in particular, 

could hurt our business and financial results. We also may face potential charges resulting from the write-down of inventory of outdated products that we cannot sell. 

    eshare has traditionally relied on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenues, and we expect this trend will continue
for our future call center revenues.  

    eshare has historically derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of call center revenues in any period from a limited
number of large corporate clients. In 2000, eshare's five largest customers accounted for 16.6% of its total revenues. During 1999, eshare's five largest customers accounted for 28.2% of its total
revenues. The loss, deferral or cancellation of an order from one of these customers could have a significant impact on our operating results. eshare's current customers might not place additional
orders, and we might not obtain orders of similar magnitude from other customers. If we fail to retain any major customer of eshare, suffer any reduction, delay in or cancellation of orders by any
such customer, or fail to market successfully CIM Solutions to new customers, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    RoweCom currently receives substantially all of its revenues from a limited number of services.  

    RoweCom currently derives substantially all of its revenues from the sale of knowledge resources, which RoweCom sells principally through its desktop and
library services. If the RoweCom merger is completed, any decline in demand for knowledge resources, an inability to integrate RoweCom's sales model into the companies RoweCom has recently acquired,
or an inability to penetrate new markets as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
condition. 

    Our international operations are subject to many unique risks.  

    eshare's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 31.7% and 27.6% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A significant
element of our business strategy is to continue expansion of eshare's and RoweCom's operations in international markets. This expansion will continue to require significant management attention and
financial resources to develop eshare's international sales channels. Because of the difficulty in penetrating new markets, we may not be able to maintain or increase international revenues. Our
international operations are subject to a number of inherent risks, which will increase as the international operations expand, including: 

•
significant
volatility in the level and timing of business;

•
the
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;

•
changes
in foreign legal and regulatory requirements;

•
changes
in tariffs;

•
the
costs of localizing products for foreign markets and integrating products with foreign system components;

•
longer
accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; 

•
difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

•
reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

•
potentially
adverse tax consequences;

•
political
and economic instability; and

•
the
higher cost of foreign service delivery. 

    While
eshare's expenses incurred in foreign countries typically have been denominated in the local currencies, revenues generated by eshare's international sales typically have been
paid in
U.S. dollars, British pounds or Euros. We could experience fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future that would have a material adverse impact on our international operations. 

    Our growth in operations will likely be dependent upon the successful development of direct and indirect sales channels.  

    eshare primarily sells its products domestically through a direct sales force and internationally through both direct and indirect sales channels. eshare
supports customers with internal technical and outsourced customer support staff. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will greatly depend on our ability to recruit and
train sufficient technical and direct sales personnel and to outsource effectively our customer support functions. eshare has in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified technical and
sales personnel. If we are unable to rapidly and effectively expand eshare's technical staff and direct sales force, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    We
believe that our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to develop and maintain eshare's indirect sales channels, including value added resellers, or VARs, and
distributors. Additionally, our investment of significant resources to develop these indirect sales channels could adversely affect our operating results if they do not generate sufficient additional
revenues. 

    If
we are unable to recruit and retain qualified VARs and distributors, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased indirect sales also could adversely affect our
average selling prices and result in lower gross margins because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels. Sales of eshare products through indirect channels
will reduce our gross profits from our services because VARs and distributors provide these services. 

    As
indirect sales increase, our direct contact with our customer base will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating customer satisfaction and
recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, VARs and distributors may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Our strategy of marketing products directly to
customers and indirectly through VARs and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and, to the extent
different VARs and distributors target the same customers, VARs and distributors may also come into conflict with each other. Any channel conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on
our relationships with VARs and distributors or hurt our ability to attract new VARs and distributors. 

Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock  

    The market price of divine common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause litigation against us and prevent eshare
shareholders from reselling their divine shares at or above the prices at which they acquire them in the merger.  

    From divine's initial public offering in July 2000 through the date of this document, the price per share of divine common stock has ranged from a high of
$12.44 to a low of $1.00. The market price of divine common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various factors, many of which are
beyond our control, including: 

•
quarterly
variations in operating results;

•
volatility
in the stock market;

•
volatility
in the general economy;

•
changes
in interest rates;

•
announcements
of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors; and

•
changes
in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. 

    In
addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and CIM product and related professional service
companies. Broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. As a result, eshare shareholders may be unable to resell their shares of divine common stock that they
receive in the merger at or above the prices at which they acquired them. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company's securities has often led to securities class action litigation.
Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market
price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, our access to capital and other aspects of our business, which could also harm our business. 

    Our stockholders rights agreement and provisions in our charter, our by-laws and Delaware law could delay or deter tender
offers or takeover attempts that may offer you a premium for your common stock.  

    Our stockholders rights agreement and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for
a third party to acquire control of us, even if that transaction would be beneficial to you. These impediments include: 

•
the
rights issued in connection with the stockholders rights agreement that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires
15% or more of our common stock unless the rights are first cancelled or redeemed by our board of directors, in its discretion;

•
the
classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; 

•
the
ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;

•
a
requirement that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chairman, president or a majority of our board of directors;

•
a
prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;

•
a
requirement that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our
stockholders; and

•
the
adoption of a provision of Delaware law that prohibits us from entering into some business combinations with interested stockholders without the
approval of our board of directors. 

    The
existence of the stockholders rights agreement and these provisions may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential
inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. 

    Our stock price may decline if a large number of shares are sold or there is a perception that these sales may occur.  

    The market price of our stock could decline as a result of additional sales of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur. As of the record
date for the divine special meeting, there was an aggregate of 

 shares of restricted divine common stock that could be resold
only
through registration under the Securities Act or under an available exemption from registration, including the exemption provided by Rule 144. As of the record date,    of those
shares were eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations of Rule 144; 13,800,000 shares will be registered pursuant to a registration statement on
Form S-3 that divine has agreed to file on or before September 1, 2001 in connection with the Emicom transaction; and the remaining 

 shares will become
eligible for sale between the record date and August 2002, subject to certain lock-up agreements
described below. 

    The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of the large number of shares that will become eligible for sale upon
consummation of the merger.  

    Based
upon divine's closing sale price of $

 on      , 2001, divine would issue 

shares of divine common stock in the merger and grant or assume options to purchase      additional shares of divine
common stock. As a result, we would have outstanding approximately 

 shares of common stock after the merger (assuming no exercise prior
to the merger of outstanding options to acquire 

 shares of divine common stock and after giving effect to the completion of the RoweCom
transaction). 

    Based
on the foregoing assumptions,       of the shares of divine common stock issued in the merger will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction
under the Securities Act, and             shares of divine common stock issued in the merger to eshare's affiliates will be eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and
other
limitations of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, including             shares to be issued 

to eshare's principal shareholder, Szlam Partners, subject to the stockholder agreement described below. The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of these sales or the
perception that these sales could occur. 

    Aleksander
Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, and Szlam Partners have agreed with divine that, for a period of one year from the date of the closing of the
merger, they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to shares of our common stock they receive in connection with the
merger, other than their right to sell shares directly to divine pursuant to the terms of their stockholder agreement with divine. Similarly, in connection with the acquisition of Emicom
Group, Inc. on July 18, 2001, certain of the founders of Emicom have agreed that they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any
rights with respect to the 6,179,104 shares of divine common stock they received in that transaction until July 18, 2002. An early waiver of these lock-up agreements by us could
permit sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 

    If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the liquidity, visibility and price of our common stock may decrease.  

    Since divine's initial public offering in July 2000, divine common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Shares of our common stock could
be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq
National Market, including the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would be forced to list our common stock on the OTC Bulletin
Board or some other quotation medium, depending upon our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. If this happens, an investor might find it more difficult to buy
and sell, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, shares of our common stock. This lack of visibility and liquidity could further decrease the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting
from the Nasdaq National Market might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements about divine, eshare and the combined company within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information regarding: 

•

Record Dates for the Special Meetings; Voting Rights  

 divine Special Meeting  

    Only recordholders of divine common stock at the close of business on the record date,             , 2001, are entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, the
divine special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were             shares of divine common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately
      holders of record. Each recordholder of divine common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on at the divine special
meeting. 

 eshare Special Meeting  

    Only recordholders of eshare common shares at the close of business on the record date,             , 2001, are entitled to notice of, and to
vote at,
the eshare special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were             eshare common shares outstanding and entitled to vote, held by
approximately      
holders of record. Each recordholder of eshare common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on at the eshare special meeting. 

Quorum; Required Votes  

 divine Special Meeting  

    At the divine special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of divine common
stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as defined below under "—Proxies") will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists. If the issuance of the divine common stock in the merger requires divine stockholder approval, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of divine common
stock that are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the divine special meeting will be required. Abstentions by divine stockholders will have the same effect as a vote against the
proposed issuance of divine common stock in the merger. Broker non-votes are counted as present, but are deemed not entitled to vote on proposals for which brokers do not have 

discretionary authority and, therefore, have no effect other than to reduce the number of affirmative votes needed to approve the issuance of the divine common stock. 

 eshare Special Meeting  

    At the eshare special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding eshare common shares
entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The affirmative vote of (1) a majority of the
eshare common shares outstanding as of the record date is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, and (2) a majority of the votes cast at the eshare special meeting
will be required to approve the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan. Abstentions by eshare shareholders will have the same effect as votes against each of the proposed merger and the
proposed amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the proposed amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan, other than
to reduce the number of affirmative votes needed to approve the proposal, but will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal. Therefore, we encourage eshare shareholders that have their
eshare common shares registered in the name of their broker to direct their broker on how to vote their shares. 

    divine
has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare,
under which divine has been granted the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. As of the
record date, the shares subject to this agreement represented approximately  % of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting. 

    Andrew
J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is a member of the eshare board of directors. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned 

 eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting, and has indicated his intention to vote these shares in favor of
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. As of the record date, eshare's directors and executive officers (other than Mr. Szlam and Mr. Filipowski) beneficially
owned an aggregate of 

 eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting and have indicated their intention
to vote
these shares, or cause these shares to be voted, in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. As of the record date, the eshare common shares beneficially owned by
eshare's directors and executive officers and entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting, in the aggregate, represented approximately    % of eshare's outstanding common shares
entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting. 

Proxies  

    All shares of divine common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the divine special meeting and all eshare common shares
represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the eshare special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies.
If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted 
FOR
 the approval of the issuance of divine common stock in
the merger, in the case of shares of divine 

common stock, or 
FOR
 approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger and the approval of the amendment to the eshare employee stock
purchase plan, in the case of eshare common shares. 

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must direct them on how to vote your shares. If you do not provide these directions and a broker or bank holding
your shares returns an executed proxy card indicating that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on the approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the merger, in the
case of a divine stockholder, or the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, and/or the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan, in the case of an eshare
shareholder, this will constitute a broker non-vote. Shares represented by broker non-votes will be considered present at the special meetings for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the merger for divine or the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger and the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan for eshare. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide directions on how to vote by following
the instructions provided to you by your broker. 

    divine
stockholders may vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have the control number appearing on your proxy
card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by mail. See the instructions on
the proxy card or voting instructions card for a detailed description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures. divine believes that the granting of proxies by telephone or over the Internet is
valid under Delaware law. Please note that if you choose to vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges incurred. 

eshare shareholders may only vote in person at the eshare special meeting or by granting a proxy by signing and mailing the proxy card.  

    Neither divine nor eshare expects that any matter other than approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the merger, in the case of divine, and approval
of the merger agreement and the merger and approval of the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan, in the case of eshare, will be brought before its respective special meeting. If,
however, other matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless you withhold authority to do so on the
proxy card. 

    Stockholders
or shareholders of record may change their proxies in any of the following ways: 

•
by
sending a written notice to the secretary of either divine or eshare, as applicable, prior to the special meeting, stating that they would like to
revoke their proxies;

•
by
completing, signing and dating another proxy card and returning it by mail prior to the special meeting;

•
by
telephone or via the Internet, if they are divine stockholders, by following the instructions provided on their proxy cards; or

•
by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

Attendance
at a special meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy; you must cast an actual vote. 

    If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, including under the divine employee stock purchase plan, and you have directed that person to vote your
shares, you must instruct that person if you want to change your vote. 

    If
sufficient votes in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, in the case of the eshare special meeting, or the issuance of divine common stock, in the
case of the divine special meeting, are not received by the time scheduled for the respective special meetings, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments or postponements of
the respective special meetings for a period or periods of no more than thirty days in the aggregate to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote for such
adjournment or postponement those proxies that authorize them to vote for the adoption and approval of merger agreement and the merger, in the case of the eshare special meeting, or the issuance of
divine common stock, in the case of the divine special meeting. They will vote against any such adjournment or postponement those proxies that direct them to vote against adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and the merger, in the case of the eshare special meeting, or the issuance of divine common stock, in the case of the divine special meeting. Any adjournment or postponement will
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast or, if a quorum is not present, a majority of the votes represented in person or by proxy at the session of the special meeting to be
adjourned or postponed. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

    divine and eshare will share equally the expenses incurred in printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The initial solicitation of proxies
by mail may be supplemented by telephone, Internet or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of divine and eshare, respectively. No additional compensation will be
paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for these services. divine and eshare will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of divine common stock and eshare
common shares beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses
in so doing. 

    eshare
shareholders should not send in any eshare stock certificates with their proxy card. The exchange agent will mail a transmittal letter to you containing instructions for the
surrender of eshare stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

THE MERGER    

    This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement, voting agreement and
stockholder agreement. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read
carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents to which we refer for a more complete understanding of the merger. Complete copies of the merger agreement, the voting
agreement and the stockholder agreement are attached as Annexes A, B and C, respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Structure of the Merger  

    If the eshare shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and, if necessary, divine stockholders approve the issuance of divine common
stock in the merger, and all other conditions to the merger agreement are satisfied, eshare will merge into DES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. As a result, eshare will cease its separate
corporate existence and become a part of DES, the surviving corporation. We currently anticipate that we will complete the merger on or about             , 2001 and, in any event,
unless the
parties agree otherwise, on the second business day after obtaining stockholder and shareholder approval at the special meetings and satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions of the merger
agreement. 

Background of the Merger  

    As part of their continuous efforts to increase shareholder value, eshare's board and executive management have regularly evaluated potential strategic
combinations. To that end, eshare employed Broadview International LLC to act as its financial advisor and assist in this regard. eshare, with Broadview's assistance, has from time to time evaluated
numerous potential strategic relationships. 

    In
December 2000, eshare's executive management met to discuss a wide range of strategic options for the business coincident with the usual end of year review and finalization
of the 2001 operating plan and to reevaluate its overall business strategy and operations. At that time, eshare's management agreed that, while exploring opportunities in the market, and pending
completion of a strategic alternative, eshare would maintain its efforts to increase shareholder value by continuing to develop and market its products and services. 

    In
late February 2001, a representative of divine contacted Aleksander Szlam, chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, to discuss a potential business arrangement.
Representatives of divine had expressed a general interest in potentially acquiring eshare in the spring of 2000, but neither company pursued a transaction at that time. Mr. Szlam invited
divine to develop a proposal for review by eshare. 

    On
February 22, 2001, eshare's executive management met with representatives of a third party to discuss the prospect of a strategic business combination. 

    On
March 20, 2001, eshare's executive management discussed the status of potential strategic business arrangements with the eshare board. All of eshare's directors were present
at this meeting except Andrew J. Filipowski. Mr. Filipowski, as chairman and chief executive officer of divine, did not participate in any eshare board discussions concerning potential 

transactions with divine or the third party. The eshare board authorized eshare's executive management to proceed with separate preliminary discussions with both divine and the third party concerning
a possible transaction. 

    On
March 23, 2001, eshare's executive management gave a presentation concerning its general business strategies, products and services to the divine transaction team.

    From

operating results, financial systems and preliminary due diligence matters. 

    On

transaction structure, valuation and operational matters. 

    Also
on April 18, 2001, divine sent a preliminary, non-binding term sheet to the chief executive officer of eshare, setting forth a
stock-for-stock merger proposal. The transaction structure and valuation were discussed by eshare's chief executive officer and representatives of divine. 

    On
April 20, 2001, the divine transaction team discussed due diligence and operational matters with its outside accounting consultants. 

    In
May 2001, Broadview, at eshare's request, began to evaluate the indications of interest received from both divine and the third party and to assist eshare in discussions
with potential strategic partners. From this date through the execution of the merger agreement with divine, members of eshare's executive management regularly discussed eshare's strategic
alternatives with Broadview. 

    On
May 9, 2001, eshare's chief executive officer conducted separate meetings in Atlanta, Georgia with divine and the third party to review the status of a potential business
transaction. At these meetings, each company was invited to continue to pursue a strategic combination with eshare. 

    On
May 20, 2001, the divine transaction team presented the status, structure and financial terms of the potential eshare acquisition to the executive management of divine.

    On May 24, 2001, Broadview and the third party's outside financial advisor discussed the preparation of a preliminary, non-binding term sheet outlining the proposed
terms and conditions of a possible transaction.

operations, technology, financial condition and prospects and other preliminary due diligence matters. 

    On
May 30, 2001, the divine transaction team distributed summary due diligence information concerning eshare to divine's board of directors. 

    On
May 31, 2001, representatives of divine and eshare's chief executive officer discussed transaction structure and valuation issues. After receiving the preliminary approval
of its board, divine presented a revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining the proposed terms and conditions of a stock-for-stock merger, including a
fixed exchange ratio of divine shares per eshare common share. 

    Also
on May 31, 2001, Broadview provided additional information concerning eshare to the third party's financial advisor. 

    On
June 1, 2001, Broadview, eshare's executive management and outside counsel discussed the previous negotiations and identified outstanding issues in connection with the
non-binding term sheet submitted by divine and the expression of interest of the third party. Representatives of Broadview separately discussed various business and valuation issues with
divine and the third party's financial advisor. 

    On
June 4, 2001, divine presented a revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a potential
stock-for-stock merger transaction. Broadview reviewed the revised, non-binding term sheet with eshare's executive management and outside counsel and subsequently
discussed outstanding issues with divine. Later that evening, divine delivered a further revised, non-binding term sheet to eshare responding to the issues presented by Broadview. 

    Also
on June 4, 2001, the third party's financial advisor indicated to Broadview that the third party could not meet eshare's valuation expectations and would not be submitting
a term sheet for a possible transaction. 

    On
June 5, 2001, Broadview reviewed preliminary valuation information and outstanding issues concerning the non-binding divine term sheet with eshare's board and
executive management. eshare's board authorized Broadview to continue negotiations with divine and requested a meeting among eshare's board, eshare's executive management and the divine transaction
team to discuss divine's business strategy and rationale for the possible transaction. 

    On
June 6, 2001, Broadview communicated eshare's negotiating position to divine and the request of eshare's board for a meeting at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia. 

    Also
on June 6, 2001, the third party's financial advisor discussed a possible revised valuation range with Broadview. 

    On June 7, 2001, Broadview and divine discussed alternative transaction structures providing potential price protection for eshare's shareholders. 

    Also
on June 7, 2001, Broadview requested that the third party's financial advisor submit a preliminary, non-binding term sheet on behalf of the third party. 

    On
June 8, 2001, representatives of divine met with eshare's executive management and Broadview at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia to engage in an initial due
diligence review of divine's business strategy and discuss the merits of a potential business combination between the companies. 

    On
June 11, 2001, the third party's financial advisor presented a preliminary, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a
possible transaction between the third party and eshare. The terms presented by the third party provided for a mix of cash and stock at a lower valuation than that proposed by divine. 

    On
June 12, 2001, Broadview discussed the preliminary, non-binding term sheet with the third party's financial advisor. 

    Also
on June 12, 2001, divine presented a further revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a possible transaction
between divine and eshare, including price protection for eshare's shareholders in the form of a price collar. 

    On
June 13, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board and executive management reviewed the non-binding term sheets provided by divine and the third party. eshare's board
deemed the divine non-binding term sheet to be superior to that of the third party, authorized Broadview to clarify various issues regarding the price collar structure, and instructed
eshare's executive management to sign a 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine pending satisfactory resolution of the open issues. 

    On
June 14, 2001, eshare entered into a 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine to pursue a possible business combination. 

    Also
on June 14, 2001, the revised terms and valuation of the potential eshare acquisition were tentatively approved by divine's board. divine's outside counsel transmitted an
initial business due diligence request to eshare and Broadview and began to draft the definitive merger agreement and ancillary documentation. 

    From
June 18 through June 28, 2001, several meetings were held at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia among representatives of eshare, divine, the companies'
outside counsel and divine's outside accounting consultants to review eshare's operations, technology and financial condition, as well as to discuss divine's operations and the potential synergies of
the combined companies. At these meetings, members of eshare's executive management presented an overview highlighting eshare's operations, product positioning, technology, research and development
efforts and results of operations and financial conditions. Meetings among representatives of eshare, divine and Broadview regarding financial and technological due diligence issues concerning both
companies and post-merger integration matters continued through the execution of the merger agreement, as did legal and business due diligence by divine's representatives. Negotiation of
the definitive terms of the merger agreement and ancillary documentation among divine's outside counsel, eshare's outside counsel and Broadview also continued through the execution of the merger
agreement. 

    On June 20, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board and executive management reviewed the price collar structure in light of the market prices of divine common stock and eshare
common shares. eshare's board authorized Broadview to negotiate a revised price collar structure with divine.

merger agreement. 

    On
June 28, 2001, Broadview, eshare's board and eshare's executive management discussed the status of the divine price collar negotiations. eshare's board authorized Broadview
to re-approach the third party's financial advisor after the expiration of the divine exclusivity period to determine if the third party remained interested in pursuing a potential
strategic transaction with eshare. The divine exclusivity period expired at midnight on this date. 

    On
June 29, 2001, the third party's financial advisor indicated that the third party remained interested in a potential transaction, but only at the valuation range previously
discussed. 

    Also
on June 29, 2001, divine's board tentatively approved a revised price collar structure, which was outlined in a further revised, non-binding term sheet
presented to Broadview later that evening. 

    On
June 30, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board, executive management and outside counsel discussed divine's further revised, non-binding term sheet and the third
party's verbal indication of continued interest. eshare's board concluded that divine's offer was superior and determined that there was no reason to move forward with the third party unless presented
with a substantially improved offer. eshare's board authorized Broadview to continue negotiations concerning greater price protection for eshare shareholders with divine. 

    On
July 2, 2001, eshare entered into a second 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine to pursue a possible business combination. 

    From
July 2 to July 3, 2001, eshare's outside counsel conducted a due diligence review of divine's operations at divine's offices located in Lisle, Illinois. 

    Also
on July 3, 2001, Broadview, eshare's board and executive management discussed the status of negotiations, timing issues and the roles and responsibilities of eshare's
independent directors, as well as the scope of Broadview's fairness opinion. eshare's independent directors (Messrs. Jeffery, House, Pellicci and Tito) determined that they should obtain
independent counsel to review the merger agreement and ancillary documents and advise them. The independent directors held a separate meeting with independent counsel to discuss the specifics of the
proposed agreements. 

    On
July 4, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel reviewed the proposed merger transaction, the proposed ancillary transactions to which Mr. Szlam and entities
controlled by him would be parties and the scope of their fiduciary duties with the independent counsel. 

    On
July 5, 2001, Broadview, eshare's outside counsel, Mr. Szlam, eshare's independent directors, eshare's executive management and independent counsel held a meeting at which 

eshare's independent directors requested a chronology of the discussions with divine and the third party and a summary of the merger agreement and ancillary documents. Later that day, the independent
directors and independent counsel met to review the requested materials and to discuss the merger transaction and the ancillary transactions. In their fiduciary capacity to the company's public
shareholders, eshare's independent directors requested that certain elements of the ancillary transactions be restructured. Later that same day, another meeting was held with the independent
directors, independent counsel, Broadview and eshare's outside counsel, at which Broadview reported on transaction structure changes it felt were necessary to provide eshare with a fairness opinion
taking into consideration both the merger and the ancillary transactions. The independent directors and independent counsel then met separately to discuss transaction structure alternatives and
subsequently requested that Broadview negotiate with divine to restructure various elements of the merger and ancillary transactions. 

    On
July 6, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel continued to meet and review further transaction structure changes and the progress of negotiations with
divine. Broadview reported on the continuing negotiations regarding the independent directors' proposed structure revisions, and eshare's executive management reviewed the potential benefits of a
merger with divine to eshare's shareholders and customers. 

    On
July 7, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel met to discuss the merger and ancillary transactions. The independent directors were informed by Broadview
and eshare's executive management that divine had made certain revisions to the transaction structure. 

    On
July 8, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel met with eshare's executive management and outside counsel to discuss the progression of the negotiations
with divine. 

    Later
on July 8, 2001, eshare's independent directors held a meeting during which the independent directors, independent counsel, eshare's executive management and Broadview
reviewed the status of the negotiations with divine and the terms of the revised versions of the merger agreement and ancillary documents. Broadview presented an analysis of the transaction and
provided its opinion that the consideration to be received in the merger by holders of eshare common shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. eshare's independent directors
then unanimously voted to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the agreements and transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously voted to recommend that eshare's shareholders approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Also
on July 8, 2001, divine's board reviewed the terms of the revised merger agreement and ancillary documents. Robertson Stephens presented its opinion that the exchange
ratio as of July 8, 2001 was fair, from a financial point of view, to divine. divine's board, with the exception of Mr. Filipowski, who recused himself from the board decision regarding
the merger with eshare, and board members John Cooper and Kevin Nater, who were not present at the meeting, then unanimously voted to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the ancillary
agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby and unanimously voted to recommend that divine's stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the merger, if their approval was
necessary. 

    On July 8, 2001, the parties reached final agreement on all terms and signed the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the stockholder agreement. 

    On
July 9, 2001, prior to the opening of the Nasdaq National Market, divine and eshare issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement. 

The Companies' Reasons for the Merger  

    The boards of directors of divine and eshare independently concluded that the proposed merger will afford to each company the complementary strengths of the
two individual companies, will provide the combined company significant potential advantages and resources and potentially will enable the combined company to address emerging strategic opportunities
more quickly and effectively. 

    divine
and eshare have each identified additional reasons for the merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully
realized. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 19. 

divine's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of divine's Board of Directors  

    The divine board of directors believes that the merger is fair to, and in the best interest of, divine's stockholders, and, with one director, Andrew J.
Filipowski, excluded because he is a director of eshare, and two other directors not present at the meeting at which action was taken, unanimously recommends that divine's stockholders approve the
issuance of divine common stock in the merger. 

    In
reaching its decision, in addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the divine board of directors consulted with divine's management, as well as its legal counsel
and financial advisor, and considered, among others, the following information and potential material factors: 

•
the
compatibility of eshare's products and services with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy;

•
the
economics of the software solutions industry, and the belief of the divine board that greater product variety, size and resources will increasingly be
required for companies to compete successfully in this industry;

•
the
belief that the combination of eshare's technology, products and services with divine's products, services, sales and marketing infrastructure should
enable the combined company to expand the range of products and services offered to the combined company's customers and increase sales;

•
the
divine board's expectation that the addition of eshare's operations to divine would likely increase the overall value and profitability of divine;

•
information
concerning divine's and eshare's respective businesses, historical financial performance and condition, operations, technology, products,
strategic partners, customers, competitive positions, prospects and management;

•
current
financial market conditions and the historical market prices, volatility and trading information of divine common stock and eshare common shares; 

•
the
financial and other terms of the merger, including the relationship between the market value of divine common stock and eshare common shares and a
comparison of comparable merger transactions;

•
the
belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective
obligations, are fair and reasonable;

•
the
likelihood that the merger would be completed, including the limited conditions to the closing of the merger, as well as the experience, reputation and
financial condition of eshare;

•
the
potential impact of the merger on strategic partners, customers and employees of divine and eshare;

•
the
likely reaction to the merger in the financial markets; and

•
the
presentation of Robertson Stephens, Inc. and the opinion of Robertson Stephens to the effect that, subject to certain matters set out in its
opinion, the exchange ratio, as of July 8, 2001 (which, at the time, would have been 2.08) was fair, from a financial point of view, to divine. A copy of Robertson Stephens' written opinion
dated July 8, 2001, setting forth the assumptions made, matters considered and review undertaken, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. divine stockholders are
urged to read the Robertson Stephens opinion in its entirety. 

    The
divine board of directors considered various alternatives to the merger, including alternative acquisitions and directly competing with eshare in its markets. The divine board of
directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, but not limited to: 

•
the
possibility that the potential benefits set forth above may not be fully realized;

•
the
substantial costs of integrating the businesses of divine and eshare and the transaction expenses arising from the merger;

•
certain
risks applicable to the merger and the business of the combined company as set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 19; and

•
the
possibility that the merger might not be consummated, resulting in a potential adverse effect on the market price of the divine common stock. 

Notwithstanding
the risks, the divine board of directors concluded that the positive factors outlined above outweighed any negative considerations. 

    The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the divine board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include the material factors
considered by the divine board of directors in connection with its review of the proposed merger. In view of the variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered, the divine board of
directors did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered. Rather, the divine board of directors viewed its position and
recommendations as being based on the totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the divine board. In addition, individual members of the divine board of directors may have given
different weight to different factors. 

    In considering the proposed merger, the divine board of directors was aware that Andrew J. Filipowski is a member of eshare's board of directors and, as of July 8, 2001,
beneficially owned approximately 2.0% of eshare's outstanding common shares. See "—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 71. 

    Based
on the above-described analysis, the divine board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of,
the divine stockholders. Accordingly, the divine board of directors has approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that the stockholders of divine vote 

FOR
 approval of the
issuance of divine common stock in the merger. 

eshare's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of eshare's Board of Directors  

    The eshare board of directors believes that the merger is fair to eshare's shareholders and in their best interest, and, with Andrew J. Filipowski and
Aleksander Szlam excluded as interested directors, unanimously recommends the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. 

    In
reaching its decision, in addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the eshare board of directors consulted with eshare's management, as well as its legal counsel
and financial advisor, and considered, among others, the following information and potential material factors: 

    Financial Terms; Premium Valuation; Continuing Interest in Combined Company.
  The eshare board noted that: 

•
Based
on the closing price of divine common stock on the last trading day prior to the meeting at which the board approved the merger agreement and the
negotiated collar protecting the eshare shareholders from divine's stock price volatility, the per share value of the merger consideration represented a premium of approximately:

•
143%
over the closing price of eshare's common shares on the last trading day prior to eshare's board approval; and

•
147%
over the closing price of eshare's common shares 20 days prior to eshare's board approval. 

•
Historical
analysis of the premiums paid since January 1, 1999 for public software companies with total consideration between $25 million and
$100 million showed only 1 of 33 companies purchased at a premium over 100%. 

    Alternatives to the Merger.
  The eshare board had considered numerous strategic alternatives and concluded that the
merger represented the most desirable strategic alternative for eshare, as well as the most attractive opportunity that was available to eshare and its shareholders. Specifically: 

•
The
eshare board believed that to effectively compete in the CIM market, eshare needed to invest further in research and development. Without a strategic
partner, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to secure the capital necessary for such investments. 

•
The
eshare board considered various strategic alternatives available to eshare, including:

•
continuing
as an independent entity and entering into strategic financing or business arrangements with other industry participants or financing sources
that would assist eshare in financing its business strategy; and

•
entering
into a combination with, or being acquired by, another company in the CIM sector. 

•
eshare's
directors and management investigated and discussed these strategic alternatives over a period of months, and, during this period, were in contact
with and/or engaged in discussions with other parties to determine if they would be interested in acquiring or engaging in a strategic or financial alliance with eshare, as discussed under
"—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 42.

•
After
intensive efforts to find another strategic partner, as described above, only one other party indicated a significant interest in engaging in a
business combination. However, the valuation range proposed by that third party was substantially lower than the price collar structure agreed to by divine and did not offer a value to eshare
shareholders comparable to that offered by divine. The proposal from the third party was not a firm proposal, did not offer the assurances of value or completion offered by divine and was subject to a
due diligence contingency. 

    Opinion of Financial Advisor.
  Broadview International, eshare's financial advisor, made presentations to the eshare
board concerning financial aspects of the proposed merger and of the various strategic alternatives available to eshare, and delivered its oral opinion, confirmed in writing, that as of the date of
that opinion, the consideration to be received in the merger by holders of eshare common shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to eshare shareholders. 

    Distribution Agreement with divine.
  The eshare board viewed favorably divine's desire to become a distributor of the
eshare products immediately upon signing of the merger agreement. The board believed that the addition of divine's sales force would help eshare's sales while offering divine personnel the opportunity
to become trained on the eshare products. 

    Complementary Strategies and Technologies.
  The eshare board believed that there is a strong strategic and technology
fit between divine's and eshare's product plans. 

    New Opportunities for Growth.
  The eshare board believed that the combination of eshare's and divine's businesses would
create growth opportunities not available to either company without the merger. These include the opportunities to: 

•
offer
and provide a suite of customer interaction products that will allow the combined company to offer its customers more complete software solutions;

•
accelerate
the introduction of next-generation customer interaction platforms that will be built around eshare's Conversations and NetAgent
products; and

•
use
divine's greater financial resources to finance eshare's growth-focused business strategy, which is expected to require significant capital commitments
in the near term. 

    The
eshare board observed that these opportunities could enable the combined company to grow more quickly and beyond the levels eshare could be expected to achieve without the merger. 

    Likelihood of Completion.
  The eshare board believed that the nature and relatively limited number of conditions to the
completion of the merger, and the strength of divine's obligations to fulfill those conditions, increased the likelihood that the merger will be completed. The eshare board also took into account
divine's strong commitment to the deal throughout the negotiation of the transaction. 

    Price Protection.
  The eshare board viewed favorably the provisions in the merger agreement pursuant to which the
exchange ratio for the conversion of eshare's common shares to divine's common stock adjusts to give the eshare shareholders substantial price protection. The merger agreement provides a "collar"
mechanism that mitigates the effect of a decrease in the trading price of divine's common stock and allows the eshare board to terminate the merger if the closing sale price of divine's common stock
is less than $1.00 for any 10 trading day period ending after the SEC declares effective the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, but prior to the date of
eshare's special meeting. 

    Tax-Free Treatment.
  It is expected that the portion of the merger consideration to be received by eshare
shareholders in the form of shares of divine common stock will be tax-free to those shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

    The
eshare board of directors also considered the terms of the merger agreement regarding eshare's right to consider, negotiate and undertake other acquisition proposals that might
arise following announcement of the merger, as well as the possible effects of the provision regarding termination fees. In the course of these deliberations, legal counsel to eshare advised the
eshare board of directors as to its fiduciary obligations in the context of considering the proposed transaction. The eshare board of directors concluded that, while the existence of the termination
fee provision might reduce the likelihood that a third party would propose an alternative transaction with eshare pending completion of the merger, the increased costs to a third party would not be
material and that the benefits of the merger to eshare outweighed the risks. 

    The
eshare board of directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, but not limited to: 

•
the
risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 19;

•
that
the merger agreement is required to be submitted to the eshare shareholders even if the eshare board withdraws or changes its recommendation that
eshare shareholders vote in favor of the merger;

•
shareholder
approval of the merger is virtually assured even if the eshare board were to withdraw or change its recommendation because Szlam Partners
intended to enter into a stockholder agreement with divine contemporaneously with the signing of the merger
agreement, under which it would agree to vote shares representing approximately 49% of the outstanding voting power in favor of the merger agreement, and the chief executive officer of divine, Andrew
J. Filipowski, also beneficially owned approximately 2.0% of eshare's outstanding common shares as of July 8, 2001; 

•
these
facts would likely discourage other potentially interested third parties from proposing an alternative or superior transaction to eshare and would
prevent eshare from engaging in any such transaction if proposed; and

•
that
divine common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past year. 

    The
eshare board believed and continues to believe that these potential risks are outweighed by the potential benefits anticipated to result from the merger. 

    In
considering the proposed merger, the directors of eshare were aware of the interests of certain officers and directors in the merger described under "—Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 71. 

    The
foregoing discussion addresses the material information and factors considered by the eshare board in its consideration of the merger, including factors that support the merger as
well as those that may weigh against it. The eshare board conducted numerous discussions of the factors described above, including asking questions of eshare's management and legal and financial
advisors, as well as independent legal counsel hired by the independent directors. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the eshare board did not find it
practical to, and did not, make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, the eshare board
did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination. The
determination to approve the merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In addition, individual members of the eshare board may have given different weight to different
factors. 

    The
eshare board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, eshare shareholders. Accordingly, the
eshare board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that the shareholders of eshare vote 
FOR
 approval and adoption
of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to divine's Board of Directors  

    On July 3, 2001, divine engaged Robertson Stephens, Inc. to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger, and to render an opinion
as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to divine. 

    On
July 8, 2001, at a meeting of the divine board held to evaluate the proposed merger, Robertson Stephens delivered to divine's board its oral opinion that, as of
July 8, 2001 and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the opinion, the exchange ratio (which, at that time, would have been 2.08) was fair,
from a financial point of view, to divine. Shortly thereafter, Robertson Stephens delivered a written opinion, dated July 8, 2001, to the same effect. Robertson Stephens has consented to the
use of its opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the full text of this opinion is reprinted as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. No limitations were imposed by
divine's board on Robertson Stephens with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in furnishing its opinion. The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations between the
management of divine and eshare. Robertson Stephens was not 

asked by, and did not recommend to, divine that any specific exchange ratio constituted the appropriate exchange ratio for the merger. 

    You
should consider the following when reading the discussion of the opinion of Robertson Stephens, divine's financial advisor, in this document: 

•
We
urge divine stockholders to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens, which is set forth in Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference and set forth as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

•
The
following description of the Robertson Stephens opinion is qualified by reference to the full opinion located in Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The full opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions by Robertson Stephens, the matters it considered and the limitations on the review undertaken.

•
The
Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of the divine board in its consideration of the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to stockholders of divine as to how they should vote at the special meeting, or take any other action, in connection with the merger.

•
The
Robertson Stephens opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger and any other transactions or business strategies discussed by the divine
board as alternatives to the merger agreement or the underlying business decision of the divine board to proceed with or effect the merger. 

    The
Robertson Stephens opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as in effect on, and information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. It
should be understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion and that Robertson Stephens disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any matter affecting the opinion which may come or be brought to its attention after the date of the opinion or to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The Robertson
Stephens opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of July 8, 2001, of the exchange ratio (which, at that time, would have been 2.08) to divine. 

 Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens  

    In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion, Robertson Stephens: 

•
reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of eshare and divine, respectively;

•
reviewed
certain publicly available research estimates of research analysts regarding eshare and divine;

•
held
discussions with the respective managements of eshare and divine concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial condition
(including certain forward looking information concerning eshare and divine) and future prospects of both eshare and divine, independently and combined, including discussions with the managements 

of
eshare and divine concerning their views regarding the strategic rationale for the merger; 

•
reviewed
the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft merger agreement dated July 8, 2001;

•
reviewed
the stock price and trading history of eshare common shares and divine common stock;

•
compared
the financial performance of eshare and the prices and trading activity of eshare common shares with that of certain other publicly traded
companies comparable with eshare;

•
compared
the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions that it deemed relevant;

•
reviewed
certain diligence materials prepared for the management of divine; and

•
made
such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as it deemed relevant. 

    In
its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information
provided to it (including information furnished to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of eshare and divine) or publicly available and has neither attempted to verify, nor
assumed responsibility for verifying, any of such information. Robertson Stephens relied upon the assurances of the managements of eshare and divine that they are not aware
of any facts that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of eshare or divine, nor was it furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Robertson Stephens has
relied without independent verification upon the information furnished to it for purposes of its opinion. 

    With
respect to the performance and prospects of eshare that Robertson Stephens discussed, Robertson Stephens assumed that divine's and eshare's managements' views regarding the
combined company's performance and prospects were arrived at in good faith, and were based on reasonable assumptions regarding the future financial condition and performance of the combined company,
and reflect the best currently available judgments of the management of divine and eshare, respectively, and it further assumed that such performance will be realized as anticipated by management. 

    In
addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that: 

•
the
merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement made available to it without material alteration thereof, including,
among other things, that the merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;

•
the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and 

•
historical
financial statements of each of eshare and divine reviewed by it were prepared and fairly presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied. 

    Robertson
Stephens expressed no opinion as to: 

•
the
value of any stockholder, non-competition or employee agreements or other arrangements entered into in connection with the merger;

•
any
tax or other consequences that might result from the merger;

•
the
value of divine common stock when issued to eshare's shareholders pursuant to the merger or the price at which shares of divine common stock may be
traded in the future;

•
the
relative merits of the merger and the other business strategies that divine's board of directors has considered or may be considering;

•
the
decision of divine's board of directors to proceed with the merger; or

•
any
legal or accounting matters, as to which Robertson Stephens understood that divine obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals. 

    The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the financial analyses is not a
complete description of all of the analyses performed by Robertson Stephens. Certain of the information in this section is presented in tabular form. In order to better understand the financial
analyses performed by Robertson Stephens, these tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The Robertson Stephens opinion is based on the totality of the various analyses which it
performed, and no particular portion of the analysis has any merit standing alone.

    No
company, transaction or business used in the Comparable Company Analysis or the Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis as a comparison is identical to divine, eshare or the
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other values of the comparable companies or the business segment, company or transactions to which they are
compared. 

    Other Factors.
  While this summary describes the analysis and factors that Robertson Stephens deemed material in its
presentation to the divine board, it is not a comprehensive description of all analysis and factors considered by Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation
process underlying its opinion. Several analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and
the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and
also on application of Robertson Stephens' own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens gives no
opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or more parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and other conditions and matters, many of which are beyond the control of divine, eshare or Robertson Stephens. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Accordingly, analyses
relating to the value of 

businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses actually may be sold in the future, and these estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty. 

    divine's
engagement letter with Robertson Stephens provides that, for its services, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive $250,000 due in cash upon delivery of the opinion,
whether or not the opinion is favorable. divine has also agreed to reimburse Robertson Stephens for its out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson
Stephens and its affiliates and any other person, director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates, for
certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to divine. The terms of the fee arrangement with
Robertson Stephens, which divine and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between divine and Robertson Stephens, and the divine
board was aware of these fee arrangements. Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking relationship and familiarity with divine. Robertson Stephens has provided and continues to provide financial advisory and
investment banking services to divine from time to time, including acting as lead managing underwriter for divine's initial public offering and currently as divine's financial advisor under a retainer
agreement. Robertson Stephens may actively trade the equity of divine for its own account and for the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these
securities.

businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private placements and other purposes. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to eshare's Board of Directors  

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of May 24, 2001, eshare engaged Broadview International LLC to act as financial advisor to eshare's board of
directors. The eshare board of directors selected Broadview based on Broadview's reputation and experience in the information technology, communication and media sector and the call center software
industry in particular. Broadview focuses on providing merger and acquisition advisory services to information technology, communications and media companies. In this capacity, Broadview is
continually engaged in valuing these businesses and maintains an extensive database of information technology, communications and media mergers and acquisitions information for comparative purposes.
At the meeting of the eshare board of directors on July 8, 2001, Broadview rendered its opinion that, as of July 8, 2001, based upon and subject to the various factors and assumptions
described in the Broadview opinion, the consideration to be received in the merger by holders of eshare common shares was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. 

    Broadview's
opinion, which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Broadview, is incorporated by reference and attached as
Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. eshare shareholders are urged to, and should, read the Broadview opinion carefully and in its entirety. The Broadview opinion is 

directed to the eshare board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the consideration to be received by holders of eshare common shares in the merger, from a financial point of view, to such
holders, as of the date of the opinion. The Broadview opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any eshare shareholder as to how to vote at
the eshare special meeting. The summary of the Broadview opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, although materially complete, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of such opinion. 

    In
connection with rendering its opinion, Broadview, among other things: 

•
reviewed
the terms of the draft merger agreement and stockholder agreement furnished to Broadview on July 7, 2001, as well as the terms of the draft
employment agreement furnished to Broadview on July 8, 2001;

•
reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other information on eshare and divine, respectively;

•
reviewed
certain internal financial and operating information, including certain projections for eshare prepared and provided to Broadview by eshare
management;

•
participated
in discussions with eshare and divine management concerning the operations, business strategy, financial performance and prospects for eshare
and divine, respectively;

•
discussed
the strategic rationale for the merger with eshare and divine management, respectively;

•
reviewed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for eshare and divine common stock, respectively;

•
compared
aspects of the financial performance of eshare and divine with other comparable public companies;

•
analyzed
available information, both public and private, concerning other comparable mergers and acquisitions;

•
reviewed
recent equity research analyst reports covering eshare and divine;

•
analyzed
the anticipated effect of the merger on the future financial performance of divine;

•
participated
in discussions related to the merger with eshare, divine and their respective advisors; and

•
conducted
other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Broadview deemed appropriate for purposes of its opinion. 

    In
rendering its opinion, Broadview relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information, including the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement, that was publicly available or furnished to Broadview by eshare, divine or their respective advisors. With respect to the financial
projections examined by Broadview, Broadview assumed that they were prepared reasonably and reflected the best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of eshare and divine as to
the future performance of eshare and divine, respectively. Broadview also assumed that eshare is not involved currently in any material 

transaction as of the date of Broadview's opinion other than the merger, other publicly announced transactions, any other transactions of which Broadview was aware and those activities undertaken by
eshare in the ordinary course of conducting its business. 

    Broadview
did not make or obtain any independent appraisal or valuation of any of eshare's assets. Broadview's opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic, financial and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of July 8, 2001, and any change in such conditions since that date would require a reevaluation of Broadview's opinion. The Broadview
opinion did not express any opinion as to the price at which divine common stock will trade at any time. 

    The
following is a brief summary of some of the sources of information and valuation methodologies employed by Broadview in rendering its opinion. These analyses were presented to the
eshare board of directors at its meeting on July 8, 2001. This summary includes the financial analyses used by Broadview and deemed to be material, but does not purport to be a complete
description of analyses performed by Broadview in arriving at its opinion. Broadview did not assign explicitly any relative weights to the various factors of analyses considered. This summary of
financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Broadview, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

 eshare Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of eshare with that of the Nasdaq Composite and the eshare Comparable Index. The eshare Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to eshare. Broadview selected companies competing in the call center and customer interaction management software industry with Trailing
Twelve Month ("TTM") revenue between $25 million and $100 million and Projected 12/31/01 revenue growth of less than 100%. The eshare Comparable Index consists of the following
companies: Interactive Intelligence, Inc.; Primus Knowledge Solutions, Inc.; eGain Communications, Inc.; Davox Corporation; and Apropos Technology, Inc. 

 Public Company Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of share price and market capitalization, adjusted for cash and debt when necessary, to selected historical operating results in
order to derive multiples placed on a company in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview compared financial information of eshare with publicly available information
for the companies comprising the eshare Comparable Index. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information.

company utilized in the public company comparables analysis as a comparison is identical to eshare. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect
to call center and customer interaction management software industry performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of eshare. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the median, average or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

 Transaction Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of equity purchase price, adjusted for the seller's cash and debt when appropriate, to selected historical operating results in
order to indicate multiples strategic and financial acquirers have been willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of
transactions that it considered similar to the merger. Broadview selected these transactions by choosing recent transactions involving sellers in the automated customer support and call center
software industries with TTM revenue greater than $10 million. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as information from
Broadview's proprietary database of published and confidential merger and acquisition transactions in the information technology, communication and media industries. These transactions consisted of
the acquisition of: 

•
Servicesoft, Inc.

the average, median or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

 Transaction Premiums Paid Analysis  

    Broadview considered the premiums paid above a seller's share price in order to determine the additional value that strategic and financial acquirers, when
compared to public stockholders, are willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of transactions involving
publicly-held software companies. Broadview selected these transactions from its proprietary database by choosing transactions since January 1, 1999 with an equity purchase price
between $25 million and $100 million. These transactions consisted of the acquisition of: 

•
Credit

the average, median or range is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

 Present Value of Projected Share Price Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the present value of potential future share prices of eshare common shares on a stand-alone basis using eshare management estimates for
the 12 months ending December 31, 2002. The implied share price calculated using the median total market 

capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for the eshare Comparable Index and a discount rate determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the past stock
performance of the eshare Comparable Index was $2.84. The implied share price calculated using the total market capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for eshare and a discount rate
determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the past stock performance of eshare was $0.98. Broadview also examined the effects of potential variations in the
December 31, 2002 revenue estimate. 

 Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis  

    Broadview compared the ratios of the closing prices of eshare common shares divided by the corresponding prices of divine common stock over the period from
July 12, 2000 through July 6, 2001, referred to as the historical exchange ratio, with the exchange ratio contained in the merger agreement. The historical exchange ratio has ranged from
0.347 to 2.061, with an average of 0.770. 

 Relative Contribution Analysis  

    Broadview examined the relative contribution of eshare to divine for a number of historical and projected operating metrics. In this analysis, projected
figures for eshare and divine are based on management estimates.

cash and cash equivalents) is 100.0% for eshare and 0.0% for divine. 

 divine Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of divine with that of the Nasdaq Composite and the divine Comparable Index. The divine Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to divine. Broadview selected companies competing in the technology-focused Internet services industry with Projected 12/31/01 revenue
between $100 million and $500 million. The divine Comparable Index consists of the following companies: Sapient Corporation; Digitas, Inc.; Answerthink, Inc.; iXL
Enterprises, Inc.; and eLoyalty Corporation. 

 Evaluation of divine Equity  

    Broadview compared financial information of divine with publicly available information for companies comprising the divine Comparable Index. For this analysis,
as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as a range of estimates based on securities research analyst reports. 

 Pro Forma Combination Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the pro forma impact of the merger on the combined entity's projected earnings per share for the fiscal quarter ending December 31,
2001 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 taking into consideration various financial effects which will result from a consummation of the merger. This analysis relies upon certain
financial and operating assumptions obtained from both management and publicly available sources about eshare and divine. Broadview assumed that the merger would be treated as a purchase transaction
for accounting purposes and that no opportunities for cost savings or revenue enhancements exist. Based on this analysis, the pro forma purchase model indicates
earnings-per-share accretion of $0.04, excluding acquisition expenses, for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2001 and earnings-per-share
accretion of $0.02 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. Broadview also examined the effects of potential cost savings and revenue enhancements, and the incremental accretion/dilution
related to those potential synergies. 

 Consideration of the Discounted Cash Flow Methodology  

    While discounted cash flow is a commonly used valuation methodology, Broadview did not employ such an analysis for the purposes of this opinion. Discounted
cash flow analysis is most appropriate for companies which exhibit relatively steady or somewhat predictable streams of future cash flow. Given the uncertainty in estimating both the future cash flows
and a sustainable long-term growth rate for eshare, Broadview considered a discounted cash flow analysis inappropriate for valuing eshare. 

    The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Broadview
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Broadview believes that selecting any
portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. 

    In
performing its analyses, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance and general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of eshare or divine. The analyses performed by Broadview are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. The consideration to be received by holders of eshare common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through
arm's length negotiations between eshare and divine, and were approved by the eshare board of directors. Broadview participated in discussions with the eshare board of directors during those
negotiations. However, Broadview did not recommend any specific consideration to the eshare board of directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger. In addition, Broadview's opinion and presentation to the eshare board of 

directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the eshare board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger. Consequently, the Broadview analyses as described above should
not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the eshare board of directors with respect to the value of eshare or of whether the eshare board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different consideration. 

    Upon
consummation of the merger, eshare will be obligated to pay Broadview a transaction fee of approximately $911,000. eshare has already paid Broadview a fairness opinion fee of
$250,000. The fairness opinion fee will be credited against the transaction fee payable by eshare upon completion of the merger. In addition, eshare has agreed to reimburse Broadview for its
reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of its counsel, and to indemnify Broadview and its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to their engagement, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with Broadview, which eshare and Broadview believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at
arm's length between eshare and Broadview, and the eshare board of directors was aware of the nature of the fee arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fees payable to
Broadview is contingent upon completion of the merger. 

Merger Consideration  

    If we complete the merger, eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. This number will
be determined based on the average closing price of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. We refer
to the result of this calculation as the divine average closing price. 

    If
the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share
they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653
divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. As an example only, if the divine average closing price is $5.00, then eshare shareholders
will receive 0.7306 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. If the divine average closing price is $1.00, they would receive 3.12 shares of divine common stock for each
eshare common share they own. 

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the
merger.

    If
the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine common
stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will not pay cash in
excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. The per share amount of these cash payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. divine will not issue
fractional shares. eshare shareholders who would 

otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash based on the market value of the fractional share of divine common stock. 

Procedures for Exchange of eshare Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration  

    When the merger is completed, divine will deposit with the exchange agent certificates representing the shares of divine common stock and an estimated amount
of cash to be paid to eshare shareholders in the merger. In addition, as soon as practicable after we complete the merger, the exchange agent will mail to eshare shareholders a letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in surrendering eshare stock certificates in exchange for the divine common stock and cash, if any, to which they are entitled as merger consideration. When eshare
shareholders deliver their stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, their stock certificates will be cancelled
and they will receive divine common stock certificates representing the number of full shares of divine common stock to which they are entitled under the merger agreement and a payment in cash,
without interest, equal to the amount, if any, of cash to which they are entitled as merger consideration. eshare shareholders also will receive payment in cash, without interest, instead of any
fractional share of divine common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them as a result of the merger. The exchange agent will return to divine any shares of divine common stock and any
cash that remain undistributed to eshare shareholders 12 months after completion of the merger. Any former eshare shareholder who has not at that time surrendered its eshare common shares to
the exchange agent may look only to divine for payment of the merger consideration without any interest. 

eshare shareholders should not submit their eshare stock certificates for exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

    eshare
shareholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on divine common stock until the merger is completed and they have surrendered their eshare stock
certificates in exchange for divine stock certificates. 

    divine
will only issue a divine stock certificate or a check for cash received as part of the merger consideration or instead of a fractional share in a name other than the name in
which a surrendered eshare stock certificate is registered if a shareholder of eshare presents the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership
and show that the shareholder paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    eshare shareholders are entitled to dissenters' rights under the Georgia Business Corporation Code (attached as Annex G to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) if divine elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration to eshare shareholders in cash, other than for fractional shares, as described under "The Merger—The
Merger Consideration" beginning on page 69. divine may make this election at any time before or after the eshare special meeting. If divine does not pay any of the merger consideration in cash,
other than for fractional shares, then eshare shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters' rights under Georgia law. 

Treatment of eshare Stock Options  

    When the merger is completed, each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price less than or equal to the closing price of divine common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market on the date immediately prior to the closing date of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio will convert into a fully exercisable option to purchase a number of shares of
divine common stock equal to the number of eshare common shares underlying the stock option multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price for these stock options will be equal to the current
exercise price divided by the exchange ratio. Each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price above the result of the divine closing price on the date immediately prior to the closing date
of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio will be cancelled. 

    Under
the terms of the merger agreement, divine will grant to eshare employees options to purchase shares of divine common stock representing, in the aggregate, 13% of the total
number of shares of divine common stock issued to eshare shareholders in the merger. These options will have an exercise price equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day
immediately prior to the grant date of the options. These options will vest in three equal installments, with the first installment vesting on the grant date and the second and third installments
vesting on the second and third annual anniversaries of the grant date. Otherwise, these options will be subject to the terms and conditions commonly provided by divine for option grants under its
Stock Incentive Plan. 

Voting Agreement  

    divine has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, under which divine has been
granted the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. As of the record date, the shares
subject to this agreement represented approximately  % of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendations of the eshare board and the divine board that eshare shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, and
that divine stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the merger, eshare shareholders and divine stockholders should be aware that certain members of the eshare and divine boards of
directors and eshare's management have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of eshare shareholders and divine stockholders. The boards of divine and
eshare were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving and/or adopting the merger agreement and the merger. 

    The Stockholder Agreement.
  divine and Szlam Partners, along with Aleksander Szlam, entered into a stockholder
agreement, dated as of July 8, 2001, under which, among other things, (1) divine granted Szlam Partners the right to sell to divine a certain number of shares of divine common stock at a
purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price, (2) Szlam Partners granted divine the right to purchase from Szlam Partners a certain number of shares of divine common stock
at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price, and (3) Szlam Partners agreed to restrictions on its right to transfer shares of divine common stock, other than as
described above, for a period of twelve months, in each case following consummation of the merger. 

    The Employment Agreement.
  Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine and Mr. Szlam agreed to enter into an
employment agreement simultaneously with the closing of the merger. The terms of the employment agreement provide that Mr. Szlam will be employed by divine for an initial three-year
term as chief strategy officer and president—CIM businesses and will receive a salary of $400,000 per year and a bonus of up to $600,000 per year. divine has also agreed to appoint
Mr. Szlam to its board of directors and nominate him to continue as a director in 2002. Mr. Szlam's employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and non-solicitation
provisions and prohibits Mr. Szlam from competing against the combined entity during the term of the agreement and for a period of three years after the termination of the agreement. 

    If
divine terminates the employment agreement without cause, it must continue to pay Mr. Szlam his salary and bonus for the entire term of the agreement. Moreover, under the
agreement, divine will agree to maintain an insurance policy for the benefit of Mr. Szlam which, in the event of Mr. Szlam's death or disability, will pay his estate or legal
representative an amount equal to the balance, if any, which would be payable to Mr. Szlam under the remaining term of the employment agreement. 

    The Real Estate Option Agreement.
  Szlam Partners and Melita House, Inc., a corporation owned by
Mr. Szlam, own the properties on which eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom headquarters, respectively, are located. Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine agreed to enter into a real estate
option agreement with Szlam Partners and Melita House upon the closing of the merger under which divine will pay Szlam Partners $3,702,978 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's
property in the U.S. for $14,560,000, and pay Melita House $2,047,022 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's property in the U.K. for £5,714,668. Under the real estate option
agreement, Szlam Partners and Melita House will agree not to raise the rental amounts due under, or otherwise adversely modify, the leases for these properties so long as the surviving company is not
in default under the leases. 

    divine Interested Director Ownership.
  Andrew J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is also
a director of eshare. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned          eshare common shares, representing approximately    % of the total eshare common
shares outstanding as of the record date. 

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing of the
merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting eshare's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under eshare's articles of
incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by
eshare's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to expend more than 150% of the annual
premium paid by eshare for that coverage as of the date of the merger agreement. 

    Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase eshare common shares under eshare's stock option plans will
accelerate upon the completion of the merger. As of the record date, eshare directors and executive officers held options to purchase an aggregate of        eshare common shares that would
be assumed by divine in the merger. 

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. 

    This
discussion only addresses United States federal income tax consequences of those shareholders who hold their eshare common shares as capital assets. It does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to an eshare shareholder in light of that shareholder's particular circumstances or to an eshare shareholder who is subject to special rules,
such as: 

•
a
shareholder who is not a citizen or resident of the United States,

•
a
financial institution or insurance company,

•
a
tax-exempt organization,

•
a
dealer or broker in securities,

•
a
shareholder who holds his, her or its eshare common shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction, or

•
a
shareholder who acquired his, her or its eshare common shares by exercising options or otherwise as compensation. 

    This
discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion
does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger. 

We strongly urge each eshare shareholder to consult his, her or its own tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal, state or local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to him, her or it.

    Tax Opinions.
  The obligation of divine and eshare to consummate the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of legal
opinions from their respective counsel at closing that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, although the merger agreement provides that
if counsel to either party does not render a tax opinion, the merger may be consummated if counsel to the other party delivers a tax opinion to both parties. The opinions of counsel delivered at
closing will rely on customary factual assumptions and customary representations made by divine and eshare. In addition, the opinions also will rely upon divine's representation to Katten Muchin Zavis
and Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP, that, notwithstanding any contrary right divine may have under the merger agreement, divine will not pay to eshare shareholders an amount of cash in connection with
the merger that would exceed Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines concerning the amount of cash that may be issued in a merger without disqualifying it as a reorganization under
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. If any of the factual assumptions or representations relied upon by counsel are inaccurate, the opinions may not accurately describe the federal income
tax treatment of the merger, and this discussion may not accurately describe the tax consequences of the merger. The opinions of counsel are not 

binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service and the courts will disagree with counsels' opinions. Further, neither divine nor eshare
intends to obtain an IRS ruling on the tax consequences of the merger. 

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger.
  The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code by virtue of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. In such a reorganization, the Internal Revenue Service takes the
position for ruling purposes that at least fifty percent of the fair market value of the aggregate consideration received by the former stockholders of the acquired corporation pursuant to the
exchange of their shares of acquired corporation stock must be in the form of stock of the parent of the acquiring corporation, although the courts have allowed lower percentages of stock under
certain circumstances. The fair market value of the consideration received by the former stockholders of the acquired corporation is determined as of the effective time of the reorganization. In this
regard, it is important to note that there is no requirement that at least fifty percent of the fair market value of the consideration received by each former stockholder of the acquired corporation
be in the form of stock of the parent of the acquiring corporation, but only that in the aggregate, at least fifty percent of the fair market value of the total consideration received by all
stockholders of the acquired corporation be in the form of stock of the parent of the acquiring corporation. 

    Pursuant
to subsection 4.1(e) of the merger agreement, divine has the option to pay some of the merger consideration in cash to eshare shareholders if, based upon the value of
divine common stock at the time of the closing, divine would otherwise be required to issue more than 28,546,506 shares of its common stock to the eshare shareholders in the merger. In this case, the
merger might not meet Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines for the transaction to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, as noted above, divine has
represented to Katten Muchin Zavis and Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP that, notwithstanding any contrary right divine may have under the merger agreement, divine will not pay to eshare shareholders an
amount of cash in connection with the merger that would exceed Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines concerning the amount of cash that may be issued in the merger without disqualifying it as a
reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the discussion immediately below —"Federal Income Tax Consequences to eshare Shareholders"
—assumes that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code by virtue of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue
Code. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to eshare Shareholders.
  Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, then
for federal income tax purposes, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein: 

•
An
eshare shareholder who exchanges all of his or her eshare common shares solely for shares of divine common stock pursuant to the merger will not
recognize any gain or loss upon such exchange.

•
An
eshare shareholder receiving both divine common stock and cash in exchange for eshare common shares may recognize gain, but only to the extent of the
amount of cash received. The gain, if any, will be measured by the sum of the fair market value of the divine common stock received plus the amount of cash received, minus the tax basis of the eshare
common shares exchanged in the merger. This gain should generally 

be
capital gain, subject to the potential recharacterization as a dividend as discussed below, and should generally be long-term capital gain if the eshare common shares exchanged in the
merger have been held for more than one year. Shareholders of eshare will not recognize any tax loss upon the receipt of divine common stock and cash. 

•
An
eshare shareholder will have a tax basis in the divine common stock received in the merger (including any fractional share of divine common stock deemed
to be received and then redeemed for cash, as described below) equal to (1) the aggregate tax basis of the eshare common shares surrendered by that holder in the merger, less (2) any
cash received as payment of a portion of the merger consideration or instead of a fractional share of divine common stock, plus (3) any gain recognized in the merger.

•
A
cash payment received by an eshare shareholder in lieu of a fractional share of divine common stock will be treated as if that fractional share had been
issued in the merger and then redeemed by divine. An eshare shareholder receiving that cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon this payment, equal to the difference, if any, between
that eshare shareholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.

•
The
holding period for shares of divine common stock received in exchange for eshare common shares in the merger will include the holding period for the
eshare common shares surrendered in the merger. 

    In
certain circumstances, an eshare shareholder who exchanges eshare common shares for divine common stock and cash in the merger will be required to treat any gain recognized as
dividend income rather than capital gain. In general, whether a shareholder must recognize capital gain or dividend income is determined under Sections 356(a)(2) and 302 of the Code. Under
Section 356(a)(2), each eshare shareholder will be treated for tax purposes as if such shareholder had received only divine common stock in the merger, and immediately thereafter divine
redeemed part of that stock in exchange for the cash actually distributed to the shareholder in the merger. Under Section 302 of the Code, the gain recognized by an eshare shareholder on the
exchange will be taxed as capital gain if the deemed redemption from the shareholder (1) is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with respect to the shareholder, or
(2) is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to that shareholder. In making this determination, an eshare shareholder may be considered under Section 318 of the Code to
own divine common stock owned, and in some cases constructively owned, by certain individuals and entities related to that shareholder, as well as divine common stock that the shareholder, or that
related individuals or entities, has the right to acquire upon the exercise or conversion of options. 

    The
deemed redemption of an eshare shareholder's divine common stock will be a "substantially disproportionate redemption" if, as a result of the deemed redemption, the ratio
determined by dividing the number of shares of divine common stock owned by that shareholder immediately after the merger by the total number of outstanding shares of divine common stock is less than
80% of the same ratio calculated as if only divine common stock, including divine common stock with a value equal to the cash portion of the merger consideration, were issued to the eshare
shareholders in the merger. 

    The deemed redemption of an eshare shareholder's divine common stock will be "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the shareholder experiences a "meaningful reduction" in his
or her proportionate equity interest in divine by reason of the deemed redemption. Although there are no fixed rules for determining when a meaningful reduction has occurred, the Internal Revenue
Service has indicated in a published ruling that the receipt of cash in a merger would not be characterized as a dividend if the shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the target and the
acquiror prior to the merger was minimal, the shareholder exercises no control over the affairs of the target or the acquiror, and the shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the acquiror is
reduced in the deemed redemption by any extent. 

    If
neither of the redemption tests set forth above is satisfied, an eshare shareholder will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the amount of such shareholder's
recognized gain, assuming that such shareholder's ratable share of the earnings and profits of eshare, and possibly of divine, equals or exceeds the recognized gain. 

    Dissenting Shareholders.
  An eshare shareholder who dissents from the merger may recognize gain or loss on the merger.
Gain or loss will be recognized by that dissenting shareholder equal to the difference between the cash received (other than amounts, if any, which are or are deemed to be interest for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, which amounts will be taxed as ordinary income) and the tax basis in that shareholder's eshare common shares. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and
generally will be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to eshare common shares held for more than one year at the effective time of the merger. Dissenting shareholders may be required to
recognize any gain or loss in the year the merger closes, irrespective of whether that shareholder actually receives payment for their shares in that year. 

    Backup Withholding.
  Certain noncorporate eshare shareholders may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 30.5% on
cash payments received in the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a shareholder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he or she is not subject to
backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal, who provides a certificate of foreign status on an appropriate Form W-8, or
who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. A shareholder who fails to provide the correct taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by
the Internal Revenue Service. 

    Tax Consequences if the Merger is Not a Reorganization.
  The federal income tax consequences of the merger to eshare
shareholders will be different than the consequences described above if the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges the status of the merger as a reorganization. That is, if the cash received
by all of the eshare shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement would be more than fifty percent of the fair market value of the aggregate consideration received by all of the eshare shareholders
pursuant to the merger agreement, the Internal Revenue Service could take the position that the merger fails to qualify as a reorganization. Likewise, in such circumstances, Katten Muchin Zavis and
Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP, counsel to divine and eshare, respectively, may not be willing to render a legal opinion that the merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Such a legal opinion is a condition to the consummation of the merger and, if such condition is not met, the merger will not be consummated unless such condition is waived by divine and
eshare. 

    If the merger fails to qualify as a reorganization, an eshare shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market
value of the consideration that the eshare shareholder receives in the merger (divine common stock and cash) and the tax basis in that shareholder's eshare common shares surrendered. If an eshare
shareholder holds eshare common shares as a capital asset, any gain or loss recognized will be capital gain or loss. If, at the effective time of the merger, an eshare shareholder has held eshare
common shares for more than one year, any capital gain that such eshare shareholder recognizes will be long-term capital gain, which is subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% in the case
of taxpayers other than corporations. Any capital losses recognized by a taxpayer other than a corporation that are not offset by capital gains may be deducted only up to a maximum of $3,000 per year,
although unused capital losses may be carried forward to future taxable years. In the case of a corporation, captial gains are subject to federal income tax at the same rate as ordinary income. A
corporation's capital losses may be deducted only to the extent of its capital gains, but unused capital losses may be carried back three years and forward five years. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to divine Stockholders.
  For federal income tax purposes, holders of divine common stock
will not recognize gain or loss on their divine common stock as a result of the merger. 

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not purport to be a
complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus, eshare shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the
merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in tax laws.  

 Accounting Treatment  

    divine will account for the merger using the purchase method for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
This means that for financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine
will record the fair value of eshare's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of eshare's net assets recorded as goodwill.
See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 90. 

Regulatory Matters  

    We have summarized below the material regulatory requirements affecting the merger. Although we have not received the required approvals as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, we anticipate that we will receive regulatory approvals sufficient to complete the merger shortly after the special meeting dates. 

    Antitrust Considerations.
  The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. 

    The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail. 

    Federal Securities Laws.
  The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of eshare
on the date of the eshare special meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of eshare and may
include executive officers, directors and significant shareholders of eshare. Affiliates of eshare may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in connection with the merger except
pursuant to: 

•
an
effective registration statement covering the resale of those shares under the Securities Act;

•
Rule 145
under the Securities Act (or Rule 144 of the Securities Act if these persons become affiliates of divine); or

•
any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    The
merger agreement provides that eshare will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) a written
agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger, except in compliance with
Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

    divine's
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to
be received by eshare affiliates in the merger. 

    Nasdaq National Market.
  divine will use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the shares of divine common stock to
be issued in connection with the merger to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the merger. When the merger is
completed, eshare common shares will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is incorporated by
reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge you to read the full text of
the merger agreement. 

The Merger  

    The merger agreement provides that eshare will be merged with and into DES Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, on the second business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, unless the parties agree to another date. Following the merger, DES's certificate of incorporation and
by-laws will govern the surviving corporation. The initial directors and officers of the surviving company will be DES's directors and officers. At the effective time of the merger, each
eshare common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be automatically converted into the right to receive a number of shares of divine common stock. This number will
be determined as follows: 

•
If
the average closing price per share of divine common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing of the
merger (referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the divine average closing price) is greater than $2.39 but is less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of
divine common stock for each eshare common share they own.

•
If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price.

•
If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

    After
giving effect to the adjustment provisions described above, if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect
to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the divine common stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. The amount of these cash payments will be determined
based upon the divine average closing price. 

No Fractional Shares Will Be Issued  

    divine will not issue any fractional shares of divine common stock in connection with the merger. Instead of receiving fractional shares, each holder of eshare
common shares will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the fractional interest of the divine common stock multiplied by the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately
prior to the effective date of the merger. 

eshare Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures  

    Promptly after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of eshare common shares (1) a letter of
transmittal, and (2) instructions for 

surrendering the holder's eshare stock certificate(s) in exchange for certificates representing shares of divine common stock and cash, if any, to which he, she or it is entitled as merger
consideration. Upon surrendering an eshare stock certificate, together with a signed letter of transmittal and any other required documents to the exchange agent, each eshare shareholder will be
entitled to receive a certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that he, she or it has the right to receive and a cash payment equal to the amount, if any, to which
he, she or it is entitled as merger consideration. eshare shareholders should not surrender their eshare stock certificates for exchange until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent. 

Treatment of eshare Stock Options  

    Depending upon the factors described below, outstanding eshare stock options may be either cancelled or converted into divine stock options upon consummation
of the merger. 

    Termination of eshare Stock Options.
  eshare stock options will be terminated if their post-merger exercise
price would be greater than the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the merger. For purposes of this provision, the
post-merger exercise price is determined by dividing the exercise price of an eshare option by the exchange ratio and rounding the result to the nearest tenth of one cent. 

    Conversion of eshare Stock Options.
  Fully exercisable options to purchase divine common stock will be converted into
eshare stock options if the post-merger exercise price of the eshare options would be less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the closing date of the merger. The number of substitute divine options issued pursuant to each conversion will equal the number of eshare common shares subject to the converted eshare
options multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price of the divine options will equal the exercise price of the converted eshare options divided by the exchange ratio. 

    divine
and eshare intend that the divine options will qualify as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. After giving effect to
accelerated vesting as a result of the merger, the merger agreement provides that each substituted divine option will be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted
eshare option immediately prior to the merger. 

Issuance of divine Stock Options to eshare Employees  

    Promptly after the effective date of the merger, divine will grant to eshare employees options to purchase shares of divine common stock representing, in the
aggregate, 13% of the total number of divine shares issued in the merger. The exercise price of these options will be equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day
immediately prior to the grant date of the options. These options will vest in three equal installments, with the first installment vesting on the grant date and the second and third installments
vesting on the second and third annual anniversaries of the grant date. Otherwise, these options will be subject to the terms and conditions commonly provided by divine for option grants under its
2001 Stock Incentive Plan.

  Until the closing of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, eshare agreed not to: 

•
solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage a "company acquisition proposal," as defined below; or

•
engage
in, or enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any company acquisition proposal. 

    However,
in response to an unsolicited company superior proposal, as defined below, that did not result from eshare's breach of its obligations not to solicit alternative
transactions, and provided that eshare promptly provides notice to divine of the company superior proposal, eshare may: 

•
participate
in discussions regarding any company acquisition proposal that is, or may lead to, a company superior proposal, in order to be informed and
make a determination with respect to that proposal;

•
approve
or recommend to its shareholders a company acquisition proposal under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934; and

•
withdraw,
modify in a manner adverse to divine or fail to make a recommendation to its shareholders of the merger, if the eshare board of directors
reasonably determines that the company acquisition proposal is or is likely to result in a company superior proposal and determines in good faith that those actions are necessary to satisfy its
fiduciary duties. 

    A
"company acquisition proposal" means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any: 

•
merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving eshare or any subsidiary of eshare; 

•
sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of eshare or any subsidiary
of eshare in one or more transactions;

•
issuance,

•
liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to eshare or any of its subsidiaries;

•
tender
offer or exchange offer for eshare securities which would result in a third party (or its shareholders) acquiring more than 50% of the voting power
of eshare, or assets representing more than 50% of eshare's consolidated net income, net revenue or assets;

•
transaction
similar in form, substance or purpose to any transaction listed above; or

•
public
announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to enter into any transaction listed above. 

    A
"company superior proposal" means any unsolicited offer to engage in a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or similar transaction that would result in a third party
owning more than fifty percent of eshare common shares (or the common stock of the surviving company in a merger), or all or substantially all of the assets of eshare, and otherwise on terms that the
eshare board determines would result in a transaction more favorable to eshare shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the merger. 

Conditions to the Merger  

    The obligations of divine, DES and eshare to consummate the merger are subject to a number of customary conditions, including the following: 

•

record date, and the agreement will also cover any common shares later acquired by Szlam Partners or any of its affiliates upon the exercise of eshare options. 

    Szlam
Partners agreed not to sell or otherwise encumber the shares covered by the voting agreement until the termination of the voting agreement, which will occur upon the earlier of

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    In addition to the pending merger between divine and eshare, on July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization
with RoweCom Inc., a business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing print and e-content knowledge resources, including magazines,
newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other sources, commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a number
of conditions, including the approval of the merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. The following unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements reflect the acquisition of eshare alone as well as the acquisitions of eshare and RoweCom together. 

    Because
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based upon the financial condition and operating results of eshare and RoweCom during periods when they
were not under the control, influence or management of divine, the information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as
of the respective periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any synergies
that may occur due to the integration of eshare and RoweCom with divine. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial
statements of divine, including the related notes, incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the historical financial statements of eshare, including the related notes,
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

    Certain
assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of eshare and RoweCom have been reclassified to conform to the line item presentation in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet. Certain expenses and other deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of eshare and RoweCom have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements    

1.
Basis
of Presentation 

    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 gives effect to the acquisitions of eshare and RoweCom as if they occurred on that date. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001 give effect to the acquisitions of eshare
and RoweCom as if they had occurred on January 1, 2000. 

    The
following summarizes information concerning the estimated purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of eshare and RoweCom. 

    The
purchase price includes $500,000 and $500,000, respectively, of estimated acquisition costs relating to the eshare and RoweCom acquisitions.

    The
merger between divine and eshare is a stock-for-stock transaction. The number of shares to be issued by divine in this merger is yet to be determined and
is dependent on the divine average closing price, which is the average of the closing sale price per share of divine's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive
trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. If the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30
shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common
stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a
number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. For purposes of the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements, the number of shares assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare merger has been calculated based on the number of eshare shares and "in-the-money"
options outstanding as of July 27, 2001, using the divine average closing price as of July 25, 2001, which was $1.263. 

    In
the RoweCom merger, divine will issue 0.75 shares of divine common stock for each outstanding RoweCom common share and "in-the-money" option. For purposes of the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements, the number of shares assumed to be issued by divine in the RoweCom merger has been calculated based on the number of RoweCom shares outstanding and
"in-the-money" options as of July 25, 2001. 

    For
both mergers, the ten-day trailing average closing price is also assumed to be the fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes. 

    The
effects of the eshare and RoweCom mergers have been presented using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon management's best preliminary estimate of fair value with 

any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price may be subject to further adjustments as divine finalizes its allocation of the purchase price
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The pro forma adjustments related to the purchase price allocation of the acquisitions represent management's best estimate of the effects
of these transactions. 

2.
Pro
Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments

(a)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 58,382,991 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of eshare's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of eshare's deferred
tax assets of $10,466,000 and stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $3,921,000, and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $45,971,000, which represents
the value of shares of divine common stock issued in excess of the estimated fair value of eshare's tangible net assets as of March 31, 2001.

(b)
Accounts
payable and accumulated deficit have been adjusted to eliminate the unpaid balance for software sold by eshare to brandango, a consolidated associated company of divine
that ceased operations in 2000. Accumulated deficit is affected, instead of accounts receivable, because eshare wrote off this unpaid balance prior to March 31, 2001.

(c)
Reflects
the effect of real estate options which are dependent on the closing of the merger of divine with eshare. Upon closing, divine has agreed to enter into agreements with
Szlam Partners and Melita House, Inc., pursuant to which divine will pay approximately $3,703,000 and $2,047,000, respectively, for ten-year options to purchase eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom
headquarters.

(d)
Reflects
divine's estimated acquisition costs for the eshare and RoweCom acquisitions of $500,000 and $500,000, respectively.

(e)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 10,235,325 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of RoweCom's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of RoweCom's
stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $17,201,000 and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $38,560,000, which represents the value of shares of divine
common stock assumed to be issued in excess of the estimated fair value of RoweCom's tangible net assets as of March 31, 2001. 

3.
Pro
Forma Statement of Operations Adjustments 

    The
pro forma statement of operations adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2000 consist of: 

(f)
Product
revenues have been adjusted to reflect the sale, during 2000, of software by eshare to brandango. The sale price of the software was approximately $1,815,000. Of this
amount, $403,000 had been depreciated and $1,412,000 had been written off to impairment expense when brandango ceased operations later in 2000.

(g)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions over an
estimated useful life of three years. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, 

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in transactions completed after
June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the eshare and RoweCom acquisitions are expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of 2001, divine's operating results will not reflect any
goodwill amortization expense related to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the amortization of intangible assets with determinable useful lives, which are generally
intangible assets other than goodwill, over the useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets of eshare and RoweCom have not yet been
allocated between goodwill and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess purchase price is considered to be other intangible
assets and therefore is amortizable. 

    The
pro forma statement of operations adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2001 consist of: 

(h)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions over a useful
life of three years. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Standards Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the eshare and RoweCom acquisitions are expected to be

combined statements of operations, the entire excess purchase price is considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable. 

4.
Sensitivity
Analysis on divine Average Closing Price 

    As
noted in Note 1 above, the number of shares assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare merger has been calculated using $1.263 as the divine average closing price. Additionally,
the fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes has been assumed to be $1.263. If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $1.00, divine would
issue 73,737,980 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $46,471,000 of goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations, would be $15,490,000 and $3,873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. 

    If
the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $2.50, divine would issue 30,724,158 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $49,543,000 of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $16,514,000 and $4,129,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. 

    If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $3.00, divine would issue 28,778,295 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $59,068,000 of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited proforma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $19,689,000 and $4,922,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.

 Historical Information  

    We began as divine interVentures, inc. on June 30, 1999, engaging in business-to-business e-commerce through
a community of associated companies in which we invested. From September 30, 1999 to December 31, 2000, we acquired interests in 40 associated companies, established a total of 13
associated companies when we identified opportunities consistent with our business strategy, and also further developed our operational procedures and capabilities. 

    In
February 2001, we announced our strategy to primarily focus on enterprise Web solutions, and changed our name to divine, inc. We no longer reflect separately our
interests in our remaining associated companies that provide Web-based technology, software, professional services and managed applications. Instead, the operations of these businesses are
a part of our core business strategy. Other of our associated companies offer software and services focused on e-commerce and vertical markets, which we include in our divine 

interVentures segment. As of June 30, 2001, there were 20 companies in our divine interVentures segment. 

 Our Growth Strategy  

    Our objective is to become the leading provider of enterprise Web solutions that offer global businesses the ability to improve collaboration, workflow and
business relationships by delivering a powerful combination of services, technology, software, services and managed applications capabilities. As the flow of information becomes more liberated and
more complex, we believe that a new type of solution provider is required to unite all of the skills and emerging technologies needed to create advanced enterprise Web solutions that position
companies to go beyond the processing of transactions and operate at the leading edge of their industries. In order to achieve this objective, we have adopted the following key elements of our
strategy: 

•
Become a recognized leader in advanced enterprise solutions.
 We currently have approximately
400 customers consisting of predominantly Global 2000 companies and high-growth middle-market companies. These customers are serviced by one or more of our four principal business units.
By expanding our relationships with these customers, we can enhance our reputation and visibility and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities with their customers, suppliers, partners and
distributors.

•
Develop, acquire and integrate offerings and solutions.
 We plan to focus on the development,
acquisition and integration of components that can be combined to form a powerful set of services, technology, and hosting capabilities that can advance and extend our customers' businesses to
include external and internal business communities.

•
Target a specific customer base.
 We plan to target customers whom we believe can benefit
most readily from greater collaboration, more efficient workflow and better management of business relationships between their customers, employees, partners, suppliers, prospects and sources of
information. We believe that these customers are primarily concentrated in information-intensive businesses such as the financial services, insurance, energy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
telecommunications industries.

•
Support and complement our solutions through alliances with business partners.
 We intend to
establish strategic alliances with a number of companies like our strategic alliance with Computer Associates International, Inc., or CA, which is also one of our strategic investors. CA's
professional expertise enhances the range and quality of our Professional Services and CA's Jasmine
ii
 Portal Software is a key component of our
Enterprise Portal Solutions. We believe that strategic alliances will enable us to improve our ability to attract and retain customers who prefer to deal with larger, more stable solutions providers,
provide additional
channels for our products, and enable us to build industry-specific solutions for our customers.

•
Position divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator.
 We plan to differentiate
divine from other solutions delivery organizations by positioning divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator. We intend to gain a strategic advantage by acquiring and developing innovative
technologies and making these part of our broader solutions in order to leverage their full potential. 

 divine's Recent Developments  

    Since April 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of acquisitions to further its business strategy. 

    On
April 2, 2001, divine acquired certain assets from marchFIRST, Inc., including primarily its former Whittman-Hart operations and its iCampus training and
technology unit, and related accounts receivable with a face value of approximately $35.18 million. The acquired business is held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine called
divine/Whittman-Hart, Inc., which provides a range of enterprise technology, hosting, e-business strategy and brand-building services. divine paid marchFIRST
approximately $6.25 million in cash, and divine/Whittman-Hart issued marchFIRST a $27.75 million balloon note, secured by the assets of divine/Whittman-Hart, that
is payable in five years, subject to acceleration to the extent of 50% of free cash flow from its operations. divine/Whittman-Hart also agreed to assume up to $10.65 million of accrued
compensation and benefit obligations for the employees transferred with the acquired businesses. The promissory note is not guaranteed by divine, but the terms of the promissory note restrict payments
from divine/Whittman-Hart to divine. marchFIRST also is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $39.05 million in bonus payments of 50% of free cash flow from
divine/Whittman-Hart during the next five years to the extent the promissory note is pre-paid. 

    In
a separate transaction, on April 12, 2001, divine/Whittman-Hart acquired additional assets from marchFIRST, including its SAP software implementation practice, its
value-added reseller (VAR) business, certain of its Asian joint ventures, the assets of its BlueVector venture capital arm and related accounts receivable with a face value of approximately
$109.2 million. divine paid marchFIRST $6.25 million in cash, and divine/Whittman-Hart issued
a promissory note in the principal amount of $29.75 million, assumed up to $3.65 million of accrued compensation and benefit obligations for transferred employees, and agreed to make
bonus payments up to a maximum amount of $15.95 million. The terms of the promissory note and bonus obligation are similar to those granted by divine/Whittman-Hart in its purchase of
marchFIRST's former Whittman-Hart operations and its iCampus unit. 

    The
acquired marchFIRST operations include customer relationship management, e-commerce strategy and development, knowledge management and business intelligence, supply
chain and business systems, infrastructure planning and brand and market development solutions. 

    On
July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc. RoweCom is a business-to-business provider of
e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing print and e-content knowledge resources, including magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and
printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical;
academia and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, each of the approximately 12.5 million outstanding shares of
RoweCom common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.75 shares of divine common stock, and RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. Based on the closing price of divine
common stock of $             , on             , 2001, this acquisition would have an aggregate value of approximately
$       million. Completion
of the RoweCom merger is 

subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. divine
anticipates that RoweCom's content offerings and procurement technology will be key components of divine's enterprise portal solutions and international expansion. 

    On
July 18, 2001, divine acquired the 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of 13.8 million
shares of divine common stock. divine has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 on September 1, 2001 to register these shares for resale. Emicom had been an associated company of
divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33% interest in Emicom. Emicom is a technology holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage technology companies
located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately held technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets. At the time of the
acquisition, Emicom held interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will
provide divine with a base of operations in the Israeli high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and
Europe. 

    On
July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court approval. Intira provides
information technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine will purchase substantially
all of the assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume certain obligations that divine intends to
restructure on more favorable terms. The acquisition of the Intira assets is expected to add to divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications business unit and other business units. 

divine Common Stock Ownership Information  

    As of    , 2001, there were      record holders of divine class A common stock and one record holder of divine class C

INFORMATION REGARDING ESHARE    

Overview  

 Business  

    eshare helps businesses effectively communicate with customers by providing integrated customer interaction management, or CIM, solutions. These solutions help
both Internet-based and traditional businesses establish and maintain high-quality relationships with their customers, while streamlining the entire customer interaction process and
reducing operating inefficiencies. eshare offers a suite of CIM software applications that enables its customers to effectively manage both new and existing customers across multiple communication
channels, including voice, e-mail, mobile, interactive Web chat and voice-over-internet protocol. 

    eshare's
blended CIM solutions combine the strength of traditional call centers with the flexibility of 24 hours per day, 7 days a week availability of the Internet.
eshare believes its applications deliver effective and innovative customer interaction solutions to companies and customers around the globe. These applications allow eshare's customers to potentially
improve their customer relationships, acquire new customers, improve retention of current customers, increase revenues, improve bottom-line earnings and more effectively utilize valuable
resources. 

    eshare
has provided telephony-call center solutions for over twenty years. As an innovator of predictive dialing software, eshare believes it has established its
eshare Conversations product
as one of the industry standards for outbound calling and campaign management for some of the world's largest financial service centers, retailers and utilities. 

    eshare's
Internet applications enable real-time, around-the-clock interactive communications and customer service over the Web. eshare's NetAgent
Suite and other Internet applications provide Internet-based e-mail management, collaborative media chat, enterprise customer service and support, standard telephony private branch
exchange/automatic call distribution support, customer self-service, instant messaging, live conferencing, distance learning, community chat, threaded discussion forums, patented scripting
and a variety of integration tools. 

    Eight
of the top ten Fortune 50 and six of the top ten Global 50 companies currently use eshare products. In addition, eshare has built a customer base that includes more than 2,500
customer sites in over forty countries. 

 Industry Background  

    Many of today's successful business models place the customer at the center of their business strategy. The dynamics of today's marketplace are changing
radically the way businesses must service their customers. Businesses must learn to listen to, respond to and interact with customers faster and more cost effectively than ever. Most companies are
feeling intense competition and increased pressure for profitability. These companies understand that they must focus on improving customer service and support to retain existing customers, win new
customers and turn them into repeat buyers. 

    Today's
customer is more informed and more demanding than in the past. The evolution of the Internet has caused customers to demand around-the-clock service.
Customers expect quick and accurate responses regardless of when they make their inquiry. eshare believes the 

Internet is dramatically altering the essence of CIM. Customer expectations are continually changing and companies must recognize and adapt to this shift to be successful. When customer communications
were conducted solely by telephone, managing customer relationships was a relatively straightforward task. With a single communications channel, plus the occasional fax, service agents generally were
able to give customers the feeling that they
were receiving personal attention. With the rise of the Internet, businesses need to meet customer demand for Web-based services, self-service, e-mail as well as
interactive and assisted communications. 

    While
e-mail, Web chat, Web collaboration and other Internet communication channels are rapidly gaining in popularity, the telephone is still the primary method of
customer communication. eshare believes that customers are beginning to expect a unified front in which all communications channels supported by the business work in concert. When a customer dials an
800 number, a service agent should have access to previous e-mails, faxes and other customer transaction and interaction history. Similarly, a customer who prefers to contact a business
via e-mail or the Web may expect that communication to be as effective as a phone call. Meeting these expectations is key to customer satisfaction, and failure to do so may drive customers
away. 

    Moving
forward, eshare believes quality CIM will require integrating live, telephony-based customer services with the ability to process Web-based and e-mail
transactions. This dynamic applies equally to traditional brick-and-mortar businesses embracing the Web as well as the newer breed of e-commerce businesses whose
customers may still desire traditional telephone contact. For both, the integration must be as seamless and transparent to the customer as possible. As a result, traditional call centers are
transforming into integrated contact centers. 

 Solutions and Services  

    eshare believes that the optimum customer interaction management solution consists of a blend of traditional call center and Internet technologies capable of
providing fully integrated customer care and consistent quality across all contact channels and touch points. eshare believes that this solution will maximize customer satisfaction and company
investments. The solutions eshare offers to address this include: 

Inbound/Outbound
Voice Contact Management

    eshare
has provided voice-based contact management solutions for over twenty years. Customers worldwide use eshare's contact management solutions to manage their inbound and
outbound voice-based contacts for proactive customer service, collections, teleservice, mortgage services, fund raising and other contact pursuits. These contact solutions help businesses manage the
complete customer lifecycle from acquiring new customers to servicing and retaining existing ones, maximizing each customer's value to the business. 

    eshare
was one of the first companies to introduce inbound/outbound contact blending so that both ingoing and outgoing voice calls could be handled by the same group of service
agents. Contact blending helps a company establish higher levels of agent productivity and improves agent response times for improved customer service. Additionally, contact blending provides
companies with the ability to better manage customer needs in situations where inbound and outbound calls are part of a multi-transaction. The eshare Conversations contact 

management solution is highly integrated with other key components of a typical call center, including host business applications/data bases, leading PBX/ACD telephone systems, digital recording
devices, reader board display devices, Web servers, e-mail servers and other network-based CRM solutions. 

    eshare's
call center solutions utilize industry standard IBM RISC, NT platforms and Windows/NT operating systems. eshare's mixed media server platform supports both CTI links to
leading PBX/ACD (software only solutions) and telephony links through industry standard call processing hardware/software to perform call processing across multiple protocols for multiple countries. 

Web-based
Customer Service

    Designed
to enhance communication between a business and its Web site visitors, Web-based communication is provided by the eshare NetAgent Suite. This collection of
customer care applications also integrates inbound/outbound e-mail traffic and directs questions and comments to the appropriate personnel. Customer care agents can monitor Web visitor
activity, proactively engage visitors in real-time discussions and interactions, respond to customer e-mail and manage multiple interaction sessions concurrently. 

    To
allow agents to interact knowledgeably with customers, NetAgent Suite provides immediate access to complete customer interaction histories, including listings of previous
e-mail exchanges and transcripts of live chat interactions. Agents can assist in two-way, dynamic form preparation, add notes from voice calls and access other records from
telephony-based interactions. 

    eshare's
Internet solutions are highly scaleable, require no additional software or other downloads for visitor use and integrate seamlessly with many leading CRM applications, back
office applications, PBX/ACD, customer care and other legacy systems. These solutions currently support the Windows NT operating environment. 

    NetAgent
Suite enables its customers to maximize online revenues, improve service levels, and earn customer loyalty, all while reducing the costs of managing the total customer
service experience. NetAgent Suite currently consists of over twelve key interaction management applications that can be purchased and enabled via license keys. 

e-mail
Management

    The
eshare NetAgent Suite EMAIL helps companies manage the large volume of e-mail that Web sites typically generate, while minimizing the agent time required to
handle them. EMAIL also determines if an automatic response to the message is possible and, if so, the application sends an automated response while the original e-mail is being processed.
As with other NetAgent Suite applications, EMAIL provides agents with immediate access to complete customer interaction histories. 

    EMAIL
enables agents to answer customer e-mail inquiries accurately and cost-effectively, allowing companies to retain satisfied, loyal customers, increase
service levels and generate incremental revenue. eshare's ANSWER application provides for automated and unassisted intelligent responses to large volumes of incoming e-mails. 

On-line Community Chat

    The
eshare Expressions product provides a turnkey solution for building user communities, providing interactive chat capability, threaded discussion forums and online presentations to
visitors and participants. Expressions promotes community collaboration and dynamic real-time interaction between users by providing the means for conducting virtual meetings, moderated
events, live training, conferencing, distance learning and interactive chat sessions. 

    Expressions
helps companies increase customer loyalty and facilitate business-to-business, business-to-employee,
business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer collaborations. 

Instant
Messaging

    The
eshare Connections product enables a company to customize and create its own branded instant messenger for its Web site's community of users. As an organization-centric instant
messaging application, eshare Connections enables user communities to interact directly in a chat-like process. eshare Connections allows users to search for other members and communicate
with one another in real time, while also bookmarking Web pages, storing conversation notes and providing alerts when specific associates log on. 

    With
eshare Connections, businesses and organizations can achieve greater productivity and efficiency, and can build customer loyalty, thereby increasing their Web site traffic. 

Customer
Self-service

    The
initial focus of Internet-based commerce was to be a self-service mechanism for the consumer to purchase goods and services. However, the traditional
brick-and-mortar companies wishing to adopt this strategy have been challenged by a customer base accustomed to an assisted service model. eshare's NetAgent
Suite provides the capability to transform those customers into a self-servicing group. This is accomplished in part by Web enabling current business processes and then migrating
them to the company Website as self-service pages. NetAgent Suite is integrated with Clarify, Oracle, Primus, Siebel and other industry-leading solutions that facilitate
Web-based customer self-service. NetAgent Suite also includes features such as Auto-Pilot and Frequently Used Pages that enable a company to push information
to on-line customers, using this opportunity to self-train customers on how to use the site's self-service capabilities. 

Multi-Channel
Administrator and Agent Desktops

    As
contact channels are added to the telephony call center or Web-based contact center, these customer interaction channels must be capable of being administered and
managed from a single desktop. In addition, agent desktops must be able to switch between the various duty
modes, supporting voice, live collaborations, live chat, e-mail, and assisted forms, among others. 

    eshare's
e360 CIM Suite enables customers who have eshare's Conversations, NetAgent Suite and Connections applications to administer these from a single desktop. The e360 CIM
Suite allows agents to switch between the various interactive voice, chat, e-mail and messaging duty modes. 

Expert Services

    eshare
provides its customers with expert services, including comprehensive business analysis, solutions planning, implementation, training, application integration and
customizations, staff augmentation and project management. eshare also offers other special customer services such as custom application development and custom project management. These services
enable eshare customers to develop, maintain and grow their customer contact centers while increasing call center productivity and reducing operational costs. 

    Installation
and integration services consist of configuration and documentation along with the physical installation and integration of the product suite. Training includes
introductory training classes that are provided as part of each initial suite purchase and advanced classes available for additional fees. 

    eshare
also supplements its applications offerings with maintenance services, including help desk support. Customers that receive maintenance services can receive customer and
technical support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Maintenance paying customers also receive ongoing system support and baseline software upgrades. 

    eshare's
customer service group is composed of an expert services group, which provides services for a fee when contracted by a customer, and a global support services group, which
manages the help desk, technical support, maintenance, purchasing, testing and ongoing relations with customers. Services personnel are located throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, U.K.,
France, Singapore and the Philippines. eshare's VARs and distribution partners provide additional services. 

Web
Customer Service Hosting

    eshare
NetAgent Live, eshare's hosting service, enables its customers to eliminate software, hardware and configuration costs from their Internet customer service strategies by
hosting eshare's CIM solutions. Using NetAgent Live, eshare customers can minimize up-front costs and maximize the return on their investments. The NetAgent Live service typically gets the
NetAgent Suite and other application software up-and-running on a dedicated server within 48 hours of order. With remote access to eshare's applications data and
reports, the customer can configure services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

 Customers  

    eshare primarily licenses its products and services to companies that engage in various CRM activities. eshare licenses its products to leading companies in a
variety of industries including financial services, telecommunications and technology, electronic commerce and Web-communities as well as government and education. eshare provides
solutions to call centers, portals, application service providers, Internet service providers, Web exchanges and interactive contact centers. 

    eshare
has a customer base for its voice contact management products of approximately 600 contact center sites. eshare's Internet business has a customer base of over 350 eshare
NetAgent solutions and approximately 1,500 Expressions customer sites. 

    eshare's
customers independently operate domestic and international user groups. Each group conducts annual as well as regional user group meetings typically focused on common
applications and business opportunities. eshare participates by conducting seminars, product demonstrations and educational sessions. 

 Sales and Marketing  

    eshare licenses its voice contact management solutions through a direct sales organization with offices worldwide. Additionally, eshare maintains a network of
distributors and VARs to re-license its products. eshare does business in the U.S., Canada, France and the U.K. primarily through direct channels, while products and services are licensed
in other countries through indirect channels. eshare maintains strategic relationships with companies such as Cable & Wireless/Mercury Communications, Ericsson, Manta Systems, Mitsubishi and
several others in Asia, Europe and Latin America. 

    eshare's
Internet products also are licensed through a direct telemarketing sales force and several channel partnerships. eshare maintains strategic relationships with companies such
as Snickleways Interactive and Linkshare Corporation to make eshare's NetAgent Suite available to approximately 200 online merchants, as well as relationships with America Online and StarMedia
to assist in marketing NetAgent Suite to their merchant partners. 

    eshare's
VARs and distributors are independent organizations that perform some or all of the following functions for its products: sales and marketing, systems implementation and
integration, and ongoing consulting and technical support. eshare believes that its VARs and distributors have a significant influence over product choices made by its customers and that its VAR and
distributor relationships are an important element in its marketing, sales and implementation efforts. 

    eshare's
marketing activities include product management, product marketing, direct marketing, public relations, press and analyst communications, event support and management of
eshare's Web site. eshare's business development group is responsible for creating distribution relationships, strategic alliances, joint-marketing agreements and co-development
relationships with business-to-business, business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer industry providers. 

 Technology and Product Development  

    eshare's CIM architecture uses an advanced standards-based framework to provide open solution implementations for best-of-breed
products. eshare's open approach also helps assure that its CIM applications/components integrate easily with other applications and services, when provided by third parties. 

    In
particular, eshare's CIM architecture offers the following benefits: 

•
proven,
tested, robust business services and application components;

•
off-the-shelf
component development from heterogeneous technologies;

•
reusable
common application elements to shorten development cycles;

•
lower
application development and implementation costs;

•
faster
development and deployment across multiple platforms; and

•
interoperability
with legacy systems and new emerging applications. 

    eshare's
applications are based on an open architecture utilizing industry standards and provide seamless integration with third-party systems or customers' existing technology
infrastructure. eshare's commitment to open architecture leverages customers' investments in other CIM components by ensuring that these systems are adaptable for future needs. eshare seeks the
continued development of products that adhere to existing and emerging standards. 

    eshare intends to continue investing in research and development to maintain its position as a leader in CIM solutions. In fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, eshare's research and
development expenditures were approximately $10.7 million, $14.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively. All of eshare's expenditures for research and development costs have been
expensed as incurred. 

 Competition  

    eshare competes as part of the larger CRM market, which includes both voice-based and Internet-based solutions. This market has been characterized by high
growth rates, converging technologies and rapid technological innovation. These market dynamics represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to eshare. 

    eshare
competes with numerous companies in each product category. Several of eshare's competitors compete across many of its product lines, while others offer a more narrow solution.
Some of eshare's competitors include, in alphabetical order, Apropos Technology, Avaya, Inc. (formerly Mosaix International, Inc.), Castel, Inc., CellIT, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Davox
Corporation, eGain Communications Corporation, FaceTime Communications, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel, Interactive Intelligence, Inc., Kana Software, Inc., LivePerson,
Inc., People Support, Inc., Stratasoft Corp. and Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    Many
of eshare's current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than eshare does. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than eshare could. 

    eshare
believes that the primary competitive factors affecting its markets include the speed of application adaptability, flexibility, scalability, interoperability, functionality and
ease of use, as well as reputation, quality, performance, price and customer service and support. 

 Regulatory Environment  

    Federal, state and foreign laws regulate certain uses of outbound call management systems. The federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, prohibits
the use of automatic dialing equipment to call emergency telephone lines, health care and similar facility patient telephone lines and telephone lines where the called party is charged for incoming
calls, such as those used by pager and cellular phone services. The TCPA prohibits use of such equipment to engage two or more lines of a multi-line business simultaneously and restricts
the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages in calls to residential lines. Among other things, the TCPA required the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, to create regulations protecting
residential telephone subscribers from unwanted telephone solicitations. In addition, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act authorized the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to
prohibit a variety of deceptive and/or abusive
telemarketing practices, including repetitive or harassing calls and requests by telemarketers for payments before certain types of services are provided. The rules adopted by the FCC and FTC prohibit
calls to persons who have indicated that they do not wish to be contacted, and the FCC specifically requires telemarketers to maintain a company-specific "do-not-call list"
that contains the names and numbers of residential subscribers who do not want to receive calls. The rules also require that telemarketers may call consumers only after 8:00 a.m. and before
9:00 p.m., local time. The FCC rules do not restrict calls made to parties that have an 

"established business relationship" with the caller or calls placed by tax-exempt nonprofit organizations. 

    The
Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act adopted in June 1998, imposes severe criminal penalties, including forfeiture of property, for fraud committed through telemarketing
calls. Certain states have enacted similar laws limiting access to telephone subscribers who object to receiving solicitations. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, limits communication
by certain debt collectors with consumers only after 8:00 a.m. and before 9:00 p.m., local time, and not at the consumer's place of business. Many of eshare's customers are exempt from
the FDCPA. In addition, certain states have enacted laws regarding debt collection practices, which in some cases may impose restrictions on telephonic collection activities in addition to those of
the FDCPA. Although compliance with these laws may limit the potential use of eshare's products in some respects, eshare believes its systems can be programmed to operate automatically in full
compliance with these laws through the use of appropriate calling lists and calling campaign time parameters. 

    The
application of sales and other taxes to online commerce is currently under discussion. In particular, the federal government and a number of states are currently reviewing the
appropriate tax treatment of online commerce, and new federal laws or state tax regulations may subject online commerce to additional state sales and use taxes. 

 Proprietary Rights  

    eshare relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its
proprietary rights in its products and technology. eshare holds numerous U.S. and foreign patents covering various processes and technologies utilized in telephony-based call management systems. These
patents cover eshare's proprietary implementations of applications such as inbound/outbound call blending, call progress analysis, screen pops of the called person's account information, Cancel Dial
and Single System Image View. eshare also has a number of pending patent
applications on CIM innovations for which patents have not yet issued. In many cases, eshare has also received or applied for patents in other countries covering the innovations covered by existing
U.S. patents or patent applications. eshare has an extensive portfolio of 18 U.S. patents and 28 foreign patents, and more than 150 patents pending in over 20 countries, including 12 U.S. patents and
140 related foreign patents. 

 Employees  

    As of June 30, 2001, eshare had 398 full-time employees (75 in professional services and global support services, 149 in sales, distribution
and marketing, 79 in research and development, 24 in information technology, 18 in training services and 53 in administration), of whom 363 were based in the U.S. and 35 were based in other countries.
With the exception of eshare's employees in its Mexico City subsidiary, none of eshare's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. eshare considers its employee relations to be good. 

Properties  

    eshare's corporate headquarters, which include its principal administrative offices, are located in approximately 100,000 square feet of modern office space in
Norcross, Georgia. This facility is leased to eshare through 2005. Subsequent to entering into this lease, the 

facility was acquired by a partnership controlled by Aleksander Szlam, eshare's chairman of the board and chief executive officer. eshare also leases approximately 14,000 square feet of modern office
space outside London through its English subsidiary, eShare Technologies Limited. The London facility is owned by Melita House, Inc., a corporation controlled by Mr. Szlam. See "Agreements
Related to the Merger—The Real Estate Option Agreement" beginning on page 89. 

    eshare's
marketing, support, sales and research and development activities are undertaken in its corporate headquarters and a 36,000 square foot leased facility in Hauppauge, New
York. Through the year 2001, eshare is also leasing space for several sales and support centers located in the U.S., Mexico City and Paris. 

Legal Proceedings  

    eshare is, from time to time, subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. eshare is not currently a party to
any legal proceedings that it believes to be material with respect to its financial position or results of operations. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 Overview  

    eshare is a provider of customer interaction management, or CIM, software applications. eshare's solutions support voice, e-mail, live
interaction/chat and hosting services for approximately 2,500 call centers, e-businesses, application service providers, Internet service providers and portals in over 40 countries.
eshare's solutions enable real-time interactive communications and services, both voice-based and over the Internet, and include customer service and support, customer
self-service, instant messaging, live conferencing and events,
distance learning, community chat, threaded discussion forums and a variety of custom integration tools. Organizations use eshare's applications and services to implement strategies for customer
interaction that increase the value derived from their customers by enhancing customer acquisition and retention activities, while reducing costs and improving agent productivity and effectiveness.
eshare offers ongoing maintenance support of its products. eshare also offers fee-based installation, integration, training, hosting and consulting services through its expert services
organization. 

    eshare's
revenues are derived primarily from product license fees for the use of its software applications and sales of related computer and telephony hardware to utilize the
software, service fees for ongoing system support, maintenance, installation, integration, training and consulting services and fees for hosting applications for eshare's customers. eshare recognizes
product revenue upon delivery of the product if there are no significant post-delivery obligations, if collection is probable and if eshare's fees are fixed and determinable. Revenues from
post-contract maintenance support and revenues from hosting applications are recognized ratably over the term of the support or hosting period. Post-contract maintenance
support revenues accounted for 25.6% of total revenues in 2000. Revenues from consulting, installation, integration and training services are recognized as the services are performed. In any given
period, a significant portion of eshare's revenues may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers. During 2000, no customer accounted for more than 10% of eshare's total revenues.
During 1999, First USA Bank accounted for 11% of eshare's total revenues. During 1998, CitiGroup accounted for 13.1% of 

eshare's total revenues. Revenues from eshare's five largest customers represented 16.6%, 28.2% and 23.2%, of eshare's total revenues for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 

    eshare
currently markets its products in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, France and the U.K. through a direct sales force and through select distributors. eshare relies on VARs and
distributors to sell, install and support its products in other countries. Revenues from sales to foreign customers accounted for 27.5%, 31.7% and 23.8% of eshare's total revenues for 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. eshare believes that its continued growth and future profitability will require further expansion of its international operations. In order to successfully expand international
sales, eshare plans to continue to establish additional foreign operations and plans to hire additional personnel and recruit additional VARs and distributors. To the extent that eshare is unable to
do so on a timely basis, its revenue growth, if any, may be slowed, and profitability may be adversely affected. eshare's international revenues are denominated primarily in British pounds or Euros.
eshare's expenses incurred in foreign countries are typically denominated in local currencies. eshare has recognized pre-tax foreign exchange (losses) gains of approximately $(43,000),
$(49,000) and $16,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There can be no assurance that future fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on eshare's future
international operations. 

    In
June 1999 eshare acquired smallwonder! softworks, Inc., a provider of multi-media, Web-enabled call center software solutions. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. Under purchase accounting, the total purchase cost and fair value of liabilities assumed were allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of smallwonder softworks based upon their
respective fair values as of the closing. The remainder of the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets acquired of approximately $4.7 million was assigned to trade names,
workforce and goodwill and is being amortized over a period of five years. 

    In
September 1999 eshare merged with eShare.com, Inc. (formerly eShare Technologies, Inc.), a provider of Internet-based software solutions. The merger was
designed to expand eshare's addressable market to include the emerging market of customer interaction management over the Internet. All historical financial information and analysis have been restated
to reflect the acquisition, which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. 

    With
the merger, eshare is currently operating in two segments, telephony and Internet. eshare believes that these two segments may collapse into a single segment as eshare integrates
its telephony and Internet solutions into a single product offering and as the market place changes from "call center" or telephony-centric installations into "contact centers" using blended forms of
customer contact technology. Segment information is detailed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

    Although
not currently a material segment of business, eshare is pursuing actively the licensing of its patent portfolio. eshare believes that its patents are infringed by a number of
companies. eshare intends to selectively move forward to enforce its patents against potential infringers when it can document the infringement and believes that it can recover a combination of
damages for past infringements and enter into license agreements for future patent use.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2000  

 Revenues  

    Product.
  Product revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 were $10,074,000 as compared to $12,667,000 for
the same period ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of $2,593,000, or 20.5%. Revenue from the sale of telephony product decreased to $8,108,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from
$9,231,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of $1,123,000 or 12.2%, principally due to the current downturn in capital spending as the United States economy slowed during the
quarter and ongoing competitive pricing pressures within the call
center industry. Sales of Internet product decreased to $1,966,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from $3,436,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of $1,470,000 or
42.8%. This decrease resulted primarily from a downturn in the e-commerce market place. 

    Service.
  Service revenues increased by $1,236,000, or 15.9%, to $9,025,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001,
as compared to service revenues of $7,789,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. Increased maintenance and consulting service revenue was the primary source of the new service revenues. 

 Cost of Revenues  

    Product.
  The cost of product revenues include the cost of material, fees paid to third parties for outsourced hardware
assembly and the cost of sublicensing third-party software. The cost of product revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 was $2,500,000, a decrease of $352,000, or 12.3%, as compared to
$2,852,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. This decrease in product cost is principally the result of software only upgrades for eshare's existing telephony customers and the decline in
absolute dollar sales of product. Cost of product revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 was 24.8% of related product revenues as compared to 22.5% of related product revenues for the
comparable period ended March 31, 2000. The slight increase in absolute dollar terms in the cost of product revenue of 2.3% was due to the different mix of products sold. 

    Service.
  The cost of service revenues primarily consist of employee-related costs and outsourcing costs for customer
support, consulting and field service personnel, as well as fees paid to third parties for installation services and post installation, help desk and hardware maintenance services. eshare's cost of
service revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 increased to $5,760,000, or 63.8% of related service revenues, as compared to $4,160,000, or 53.4% of related service revenues, for the
quarter ended March 31, 2000. This increase in cost of service revenues is related to the addition of personnel primarily to support Internet services plus investments to increase eshare's
customer support to a global, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week coverage. 

 Operating Expenses  

    Engineering, research and development.
  Engineering, research and development expenses primarily consist of
employee-related costs for engineering personnel involved with Internet and telephony software product development. Also included are outside contractor costs for development projects. Engineering,
research and development expenses decreased by $34,000, or 1.3%, to $2,641,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2001, as compared to $2,675,000 in the 

quarter ended March 31, 2000. Engineering, research and development costs increased as a percentage of product revenue to 26.2% of product revenues for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2001 as compared to 21.1% of product revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. 

    Selling, general and administrative.
  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related
costs for sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources personnel. Also included are marketing expenditures for trade shows, advertising, other promotional expenditures, as well as
depreciation and bad debt expenses. eshare's selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 were unchanged compared to the quarter ended March 31,
2000. 

    Other Income (Expense), Net.
  Other income (expense), net increased by $260,000, or 230.1%, to $373,000 in the quarter
ended March 31, 2001, as compared to $113,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2000. 

    Income Tax Provision (Benefit).
  For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, eshare recorded a tax benefit of
$1,296,000 as compared to a tax benefit of $462,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 as the result of having a larger operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. 

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999  

 Revenues  

    Product.
  Product revenues in 2000 were $48.7 million as compared to $63.1 million in 1999, a decrease of
$14.4 million, or 22.8%. Revenue from the sale of telephony product decreased $20.3 million, or 36.7%, for the comparable periods. This decrease is principally due to a slowdown in
purchases from telephony customers and ongoing pricing pressures within the telephony-based call center industry. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in Internet product revenues of
$5.9 million, or 79.0%, from $7.6 million in 1999 to $13.5 million in 2000. This increase resulted from continued market acceptance of eshare's Internet-based customer interaction
products and the growing trend of telephony-based call centers to add Internet customer interaction software tools. 

    Service.
  Service revenue increased by $3.5 million, or 11.0%, to $35.3 million in 2000 as compared to
service revenue of $31.8 million in 1999. Increased maintenance and consulting service revenue associated with the increase in Internet product sales was the primary source of the new service
revenues. 

 Cost of Revenues  

    Product.
  The cost of product revenues include the cost of material, fees paid to third parties for outsourced hardware
assembly and, in certain instances, the cost of sublicensing third-party software. The cost of product revenue for 2000 was $10.7 million, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 44.6%, as
compared to $19.4 million in 1999. This decrease in product cost is principally the result of software only upgrades for eshare's existing telephony customers and the lower cost of software
only Internet products. Cost of product revenue for 2000 was 22.1% of related product revenues as compared to 30.8% of related product revenues for 1999. This 8.7% decrease in absolute dollar terms in
the cost of product revenue was due to 

the decline in telephony hardware product revenue and a higher percentage of software products in total product revenue as compared to the prior year. 

    Service.
  The cost of service revenues primarily consists of employee-related costs and outsourcing costs for customer
support, consulting and field service personnel, as well as fees paid to third parties for installation services and post installation, help desk and hardware maintenance services. eshare's cost of
service revenues for 2000 increased to $20.4 million, or 57.8%, of related service revenues as compared to $16.8 million or 52.9% of related service revenues for 1999. This increase in
cost of service revenues is related to the addition of personnel primarily to support Internet services plus investments to increase eshare's customer support to global, 24 hours per day,
7 days a week coverage. 

 Operating Expenses  

    Engineering, research and development.
  Engineering, research and development expenses primarily consist of
employee-related costs for engineering personnel involved with Internet and telephony software product development. Also included are outside contractor costs for development projects. Engineering,
research and development expenses decreased by $3.5 million, or 24.7%, to $10.7 million in 2000, as compared to $14.2 million in 1999, while as a percentage of product revenue
they were 22.0% of product revenues in 2000 as compared to 22.5% of product revenues in 1999. The drop in absolute dollars from 1999 to 2000 was primarily the result of targeting engineering, research
and development to approximately 22% of revenues. 

    Selling, general and administrative.
  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related
costs for sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources personnel. Also included are marketing expenditures for trade shows, advertising, other promotional expenditures, as well as
depreciation and bad debt expenses. eshare's selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $10.5 million, or 22.6%, to $57.0 million in 2000, as compared to
$46.5 million in 1999. During fiscal 2000, eshare increased its reserves for bad debts to $4.6 million, as compared to reserves for bad debts of $3.0 million in fiscal 1999, for
an increase of $1.6 million. In addition, eshare recorded bad debt expenses of
$9.0 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 1999. The bad debt expense increase in 2000 was primarily due to the failure of several dot.com companies and the
write-off of problematic foreign product receivables, as well as non-collectible receivables from maintenance contracts and charge backs under expert services contracts. 

 Write-off of Purchased Software  

    In accordance with Statement of Financial Account Standards (SFAS) No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of," eshare recorded an impairment loss of $3.2 million in 2000 due to a write-down of purchased third party software. Based on eshare's evaluation of the future market
potential and recoverability of this software product, eshare wrote off the estimated unrecoverable portion of its investment. This write-down is a one-time event, as eshare has not
recorded any other such third party software investments. 

 Other Income (Expense), Net  

    Other income (expense), net decreased by $0.3 million, or 45.2%, to $0.4 million in 2000, as compared to $0.7 million in 1999. This
decrease resulted from reduced interest income earned on lower average balances invested in marketable securities over the comparable periods and a loss on disposal of assets of approximately
$0.4 million in 2000. 

 Income Tax (Benefit)  

    eshare recorded a tax benefit of $7.5 million in 2000 as compared to a tax benefit of $1.1 million in 1999. eshare's effective tax rate was
(40.4)% in 2000 primarily due to management's estimate of utilization of the majority of the current net operating loss carryforwards. eshare's effective tax rate was (9.7)% for 1999 primarily due to
the effect of not recording the majority of the benefit on the losses incurred by eShare.com, Inc. due to the uncertainty of realizing those losses. 

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998  

 Revenues  

    Product.
  eshare's product revenues declined by 11.6% from $71.3 million in 1998 to $63.1 million in 1999.
The decrease in product revenues was due to reduced demand for eshare's call center products, primarily in the United States, and to a reduction in hardware content in eshare's products. Total call
center product revenue dropped 18.3% from $67.9 million in 1998 to $55.5 million in 1999. The reduced demand related to Y2K slowdown concerns in purchasing as well as increased pricing
pressures within the call center industry. Internet product revenue increased 123.1% from $3.4 million in 1998 to $7.6 million in 1999 due to increased demand for Internet customer
interaction solutions. In addition, eshare's Internet product suite was expanded with the introduction of NetAgent 2.0 in the fourth quarter of 1998, Expressions 4.0 in the first quarter of 1999,
Connections and Response in the third quarter of 1999, and NetAgent 3.0 in the fourth quarter of 1999. 

    Service.
  eshare increased its service revenues by 23.5% from $25.7 million in 1998 to $31.8 million in
1999. Service revenues increased primarily due to an increase in the number of post-contract maintenance support agreements and growing demand for post-implementation
consulting services. 

 Cost of Revenues  

    Product.
  Cost of product revenues decreased from $21.7 million, or 30.4% of related product revenues, in 1998,
to $19.4 million, or 30.8% of related product revenues, in 1999. Cost of product revenues for the call center segment decreased from $21.3 million, or 31.4% of related product revenues
in 1998, to $19.0 million, or 34.3% of related product revenues, in 1999. The
decrease in absolute dollars in the cost of product revenues was due to the decline in the volume of shipments of eshare's call center products. The increase as a percentage of product revenues was
primarily due to the impact of personnel and other fixed costs as compared to a reduced base of call center product revenues. Cost of product revenues for the Internet segment increased from $344,000,
or 10.2% of related product revenues in 1998, to $392,000, or 5.2% of related product revenues in 1999. The increase in absolute dollars in cost of product revenues was related to the increase in
volume of shipments of eshare's 

Internet products. The decrease as a percentage of product revenues was primarily due to the impact of an increased base of Internet product revenues in relation to personnel and other fixed costs. 

    Service.
  Cost of service revenues increased from $13.3 million, or 51.8% of related service revenues, in 1998,
to $16.8 million, or 52.7% of related service revenues, in 1999. The increase in absolute dollars in the cost of service revenues was primarily due to the increase in service personnel to
support the larger installed customer base, and the expansion of eshare's post-implementation consulting practice. The increase as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to the
creation of a NetAgent support staff and infrastructure to support the expected growth in NetAgent customers. 

 Operating Expenses  

    Engineering, research and development.
  Engineering, research and development costs increased from $11.8 million,
or 12.2% of total revenues, in 1998, to $14.2 million, or 15.0% of total revenues, in 1999. The increase in absolute dollars resulted primarily from the addition of developers and outside
contractors to support Internet product development efforts. The increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily a factor of the reduced call center product revenues. 

    Selling, general and administrative.
  Selling, general and administrative costs increased from $36.2 million, or
37.3% of total revenues, in 1998, to $46.5 million, or 49.0% of total revenues, in 1999. This increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the expansion of eshare's sales and marketing
resources, and increased levels of marketing activities. The increase as a
percentage of total revenues was primarily a result of the reduction in total revenues, and the duplicate costs of supporting two business segments as a result of the pooling of interest accounting
treatment following the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc., which began its principal selling operations in fiscal 1999. 

 Acquisition and Merger-Related Expenses  

    In connection with the fiscal 1999 acquisition of smallwonder! softworks, Inc., and the merger with eShare.com, Inc., eshare incurred direct
merger and restructuring related expenses of approximately $7.0 million, comprised primarily of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other professional fees. In addition, eshare
incurred $2.3 million (non-cash) of indirect deferred compensation expenses related to the conversion of the eShare.com, Inc. stock option plan. eshare also incurred
$0.5 million in amortization of intangible assets related to the purchase of smallwonder! softworks, Inc. 

 Other Income, Net  

    Other income, net decreased from $1.1 million in 1998 to $0.7 million in 1999. The decrease was primarily due to interest income earned on
eshare's investments in marketable securities, which decreased due to lower cash levels caused by negative cash flows from operating activities in the second half of the year. 

 Income Tax Provision (Benefit)  

    eshare recorded an income tax provision of $6.6 million in 1998 and an income tax benefit of approximately $1.1 million in 1999. eshare's
effective tax rate was 43.3% in 1998 primarily due to the effect of permanent differences between book and tax and due to the effect of not recording the benefit on the losses incurred by
eShare.com, Inc. due to the uncertainty of realizing those losses. eshare's effective tax rate was (9.7)% for 1999 primarily due to the effect of recording some of the benefit on the losses
incurred by eshare. 

 Preferred Stock Preference  

    Included in results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 is a non-recurring, non-cash charge of
$5.8 million which represents the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock of eShare.com, Inc. at February 19, 1999 and the purchase price of certain
Series C Preferred Stock issued on that date. As part of the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc. the Series C Preferred Stock was converted into common stock. 

Financial Condition  

    Total assets at March 31, 2001 were $67,248,000, a decrease of $5,624,000 from total assets of $72,872,000 at December 31, 2000. This decrease
was primarily due to decreased cash and cash equivalents as well as a decrease in accounts receivable. Total assets at December 31, 2000 were $72.9 million, a decrease of
$4.4 million from December 31, 1999. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in accounts receivable of $6.3 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of
$2.1 million, offset by an increase in deferred taxes of $4.3 million. Accounts receivable decreased $6.3 million due to increased collections and the increase in bad debt
reserves and write-off of certain receivables. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $2.1 million primarily caused by a lower tax refund in 2000. Deferred taxes
increased $4.3 million primarily due to the recognition of increased net operating loss carryforwards. 

    Current
liabilities were $25,094,000 at March 31, 2001, down from $28,482,000 at December 31, 2000. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities. Current liabilities as of December 31, 2000 were $28.5 million, an increase of $5.1 million from December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to
an increase in deferred revenue of $3.2 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.5 million. The increase in deferred revenue was derived principally from
increased billings and cash collections of maintenance contracts that are generally one year in length. The timing for payment of and the accrual of liabilities varies from period to period according
to the terms of the underlying obligations and is primarily responsible for the increase.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    At March 31, 2001, eshare had $9,878,000 in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $14,727,000 as of December 31, 2000.
Cash decreased due to the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by investing activities included the sale of $1,444,000 of marketable securities, offset by the purchase
of property and equipment of $597,000. Net cash provided by financing activities of $189,000 was primarily due to the proceeds of the issuance of common stock through eshare's option program and
employee stock purchase plan. eshare's working capital was $18,835,000 at March 31, 2001 as compared to $21,622,000 at December 31, 2000. eshare believes that existing cash and cash
equivalents will be adequate to meet eshare's cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business
Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001.
This amortization of existing goodwill will cease on December 31, 2001. Any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized.
SFAS No. 142 also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 will result in eshare's discontinuation of amortization of goodwill; however, eshare will be
required to test its 

goodwill for impairment under the new standard beginning in the first quarter of 2002, which could have an adverse effect on its future results of operations if an impairment occurs. 

    In
1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The effective date of
SFAS No. 133 was delayed through the issuance of SFAS Nos. 137 and 138 to fiscal year 2001. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
measured based on their fair values. eshare adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 and does not hold any significant derivative financial instruments; therefore, the adoption of
this statement did not have a significant impact on eshare's financial statements. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Foreign Exchange  

    During the quarters ended March 31, 2001 and March 31, 2000 total revenues from eshare's international operations were approximately 21.0% and
19.0%, respectively, of its total revenues for all operations. 

    eshare's
international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to: differing economic conditions, changes in political climate,
differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, eshare's future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or
other
factors. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on eshare's operations during the quarter ended March 31, 2001, and the years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was not material. During these
periods, eshare did not actively participate in any foreign currency hedging strategies. eshare's international revenues are denominated primarily in British pounds or Euros. eshare's expenses
incurred in foreign countries are typically denominated in local currencies. The magnitude and direction of any adjustment in the future depends on the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other
currencies. In 2000, the unrecognized translation adjustment was primarily due to the decrease in the British pound and Euro compared to 1999. There can be no assurance that future fluctuations in
currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on eshare's future international operations. 

Interest Rates  

    eshare invests cash in a variety of financial instruments, including taxable and tax-advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of
corporations, municipalities, and local, state and national governmental entities and agencies. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. Cash balances in foreign currencies are operating
balances. 

    Interest
income on eshare's investments is carried in "Other income (expense), net" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. eshare accounts for investment instruments in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." All of the cash equivalents and short-term
investments are treated as available-for-sale under SFAS 115. 

    Investments
in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely 

impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, eshare's future investment income
may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or eshare may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in
interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate on investment securities at March 31, 2001 was approximately 5.07% based on predominately tax-free instruments. The fair value of
securities held at March 31, 2001 was $5.7 million.

accordance with rules of the SEC, other compensation in the form of perquisites and other personal benefits has been omitted because such perquisites and other personal benefits
constituted less than the lesser of $50,000, or 10%, of the total annual salary and bonus for the officer for such year.

(2)
Bonus
is based upon Mr. Szlam's employment agreement with eshare and is based upon prior-year performance. 

Employment Agreement  

    Aleksander Szlam entered into an employment agreement with eshare effective June 4, 1997. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Szlam is entitled to
receive an annual base salary of $300,000, and is entitled to an annual bonus of $160,000. Based on eshare's performance in 1998, eshare's board of directors granted Mr. Szlam an additional
bonus of $80,000, and based on eshare's performance in 1999 and 2000, eshare's board of directors granted no 

additional bonus. The board of directors increased Mr. Szlam's base salary in 1999 and 2000 to $330,000. Mr. Szlam's employment agreement has an initial term of two years and
automatically renews for additional two-year terms unless Mr. Szlam or eshare terminates the agreement by providing the other party ninety days' prior written notice. As neither
eshare nor Mr. Szlam terminated this agreement by March 4, 2001, it has been extended automatically until June 2003. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Szlam has agreed
to assign to eshare all patents, copyrights and other intellectual property developed by him during the course of his employment. In addition, Mr. Szlam has agreed not to solicit eshare's
customers or employees or to compete with eshare for two years following termination of his employment agreement. 

    Mr. Szlam
has agreed to execute an executive employment agreement with divine as described under "Agreements Related to the Merger—The Employment Agreement"
beginning on page 89. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  

    During 2000, Andrew J. Filipowski, Donald L. House and Jack Pellicci served as members of the compensation committee of the eshare board of directors. None of
these directors served
as an officer or employee or was formerly an officer of eshare or its subsidiaries. Andrew J. Filipowski, a member of the compensation committee of the eshare board of directors, is chairman and chief
executive officer of divine. Aleksander Szlam, eshare's chief executive officer, was a member of the compensation committee of divine during fiscal year 2000. 

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management  

    The following table sets forth, as of July 27, 2001, the amount and percent of eshare common shares beneficially owned by (1) each person known
to eshare to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding eshare common shares, (2) each eshare director, (3) each executive officer of eshare, and (4) by all directors and
executive officers of eshare as a group. 

    Share
ownership is calculated in accordance with SEC rules. Therefore, percentage of shares beneficially owned is based on 21,931,477 eshare common shares outstanding as of
July 27, 2001, and includes eshare common shares subject to options that may be exercised within 60 days of July 27, 2001. These option shares are deemed to be outstanding for the
purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the individual holding them, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage of any other person shown in 

the table. Unless otherwise noted, the shareholders have sole voting and investment control with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  

    In addition to other related party transactions described elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, eshare has entered into tax indemnification
agreements with its existing shareholders providing for, among other things, the indemnification of eshare by its shareholders for any federal and state income taxes (including interest) incurred by
eshare if for any reason eshare is deemed to be treated as a C corporation during any period for which it reported its earnings to the taxing authorities as an S corporation. The tax indemnification
agreements further provide for the cross-indemnification of eshare and of each existing shareholder for certain additional taxes (including interest and, in the case of existing shareholders,
penalties) resulting from eshare's operations during the period in which it was an S corporation. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF DIVINE STOCKHOLDERS
  AND ESHARE SHAREHOLDERS    

    After the merger, eshare shareholders will become divine stockholders. The following summary, which is not a complete statement of all differences between the
rights of the holders of divine common stock and eshare common shares, discusses differences between divine's third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
by-laws and eshare's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as differences between the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Georgia
Business Corporation Code. 

    While
divine believes that the provisions of its third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its amended and restated by-laws are in its stockholders' best
interests, shareholders of eshare should be aware that these provisions could be disadvantageous to them because their overall effect may be to render more difficult or to discourage the removal of
incumbent directors and management or the assumption of effective control by other persons. For information as to how to get the full text of each document, see "Where You Can Find More Information"
beginning on page 135.

fiduciary duties.

    In
addition to the above, eshare's shareholders should be aware of the following differences between the rights of divine stockholders and eshare shareholders with respect to business
combinations and similar transactions. 

Shareholder Approval of Certain Business Combinations  

    Under Delaware and Georgia law, "business combinations" by corporations with "interested shareholders" are subject to a moratorium of three or five years,
respectively, unless specified conditions are met. The prohibited transactions include a merger with, disposition of assets to, or the issuance of stock to, the interested shareholder, or specified
transactions that have the effect of increasing the proportionate amount of the outstanding securities held by the interested shareholder. Under Delaware and Georgia law, interested shareholders are
those shareholders who own 15% and 10% of the voting stock of a corporation, respectively. Interested shareholders may avoid the prohibitions against significant transactions with corporations in
Delaware and Georgia under the following circumstances: 

Delaware

Georgia

•

Prior to becoming an interested stockholder, the board of directors approves the transaction or transactions by which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder;

•

Prior to becoming an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves the transaction or transactions by which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder;

•

the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock, excluding specified shares, upon consummation of the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; or

•

the interested shareholder owns at least 90% of the voting stock, excluding specified shares, upon consummation of the transaction that results in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder; or

•

if at, or subsequent to, the time the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, the board of directors and at least 66

/

% of the stockholders, excluding shares held by the interested stockholder, approve the
transaction.

•

subsequent to becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder holds 90% of the outstanding voting stock, excluding specified shares, and the transaction is approved by a majority of the shareholders of the voting stock entitled to vote
thereon, excluding specified shares.

    Georgia
law also includes "fair price requirements" that would apply to any business combinations between eshare and any interested shareholder. Business combinations with interested
shareholders must be unanimously approved by at least three "continuing directors" of eshare or recommended by at least 66

/

% of such continuing directors and approved by a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares, other than voting shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. This vote is not required if: (1) the fair market value of
the aggregate cash or securities to be received by the shareholders is as high as the fair market value of their shares; (2) the shareholders receive the same form of consideration as the
interested shareholder previously paid for shares of the same class or series; (3) there are no changes with respect to dividends; and (4) the interested shareholder has not received the
benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance provided by eshare. 

Stockholder Rights Plans  

    divine's board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan in February 2001 that declared a dividend of one right on each outstanding share of divine
common stock. The dividend was payable to stockholders of record on February 23, 2001 and will expire on January 31, 2011, unless extended by divine's board of directors. The rights are
not exercisable unless a person or group has acquired, or announces the intent to acquire, 15% or more of divine's
outstanding common stock (or 20% or more if such a person or group owned 10% or more of divine's common stock at the time of adoption of the plan). Pursuant to the plan, separate rights certificates
will be distributed and each right will entitle its holder to purchase 1/1000
th
 of a share of divine series A junior participating preferred stock at $15.00 per right. The rights
are redeemable by divine's board of directors, for $0.001 per right, at any time prior to the exercisability of the rights. In connection with entering into the merger agreement, divine's board of
directors amended divine's stockholder rights plan to provide that the rights would not become exercisable in the event that Aleksander Szlam or Szlam Partners acquires beneficial ownership of more
than 15%, but less than 20%, of divine's outstanding common stock. 

    In
the event a person or group acquires 15% or more (or 20% of divine common stock in certain circumstances) of divine common stock, each stockholder, other than the acquiror, is
entitled to purchase, for the exercise price of the rights, the number of shares of the divine common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the rights. In addition, divine's
board of directors may exchange the rights for common stock at a ratio of one share of common stock per right. Also, if the rights have become exercisable and divine is acquired in a merger or other
business combination, or 50% or more of its assets, cash flow, or earning power are sold, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the exercise price of the 

right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that, at the time of the transaction, will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. 

    eshare
has not adopted a shareholder rights plan. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    Under both Delaware and Georgia law, a shareholder of a corporation participating in a specified major corporate transaction may be entitled to dissenters' or
appraisal rights pursuant to which such shareholder may receive cash in the amount of the fair value of his or her shares in lieu of the consideration he or she would otherwise receive in the
transaction. Under Delaware law, these rights are not available with respect to: (1) the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation or an amendment to
the corporation's certificate of incorporation (unless otherwise provided in the corporation's certificate of incorporation); (2) a merger or consolidation by a corporation the shares of which
are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders if the stockholders are required to receive only shares of the surviving
corporation, shares of any other corporation that are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or a combination
of the foregoing; or (3) a merger if no vote of the stockholder of the surviving corporation is required to approve the merger because the merger does not amend the certificate of
incorporation, and each share of the surviving corporation outstanding prior to the merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger, and the number of shares to be issued in the
merger does not exceed 20% of the shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior to the merger. 

    In
contrast, under Georgia law, dissenters' rights are available in the event of any of the following corporate actions: (1) a merger if the approval of the shareholders is
required for the merger and the shareholder is entitled to vote on the merger, or if the corporation is a subsidiary that is merged with its parent; (2) a share exchange in which the
corporation's shares will be acquired, if the shareholder is entitled to vote on the share exchange; (3) a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation, if a
shareholder vote is required, other than a sale pursuant to a court order or a sale for cash the proceeds of which will be distributed to the shareholders within one year; (4) an amendment of
the articles of incorporation that adversely affects rights relating to such shareholder's shares; or (5) any corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote to the extent the articles of
incorporation, by-laws or a resolution of the board of directors provides that voting or non-voting shareholders are entitled to dissent and obtain payment for their shares.
Furthermore, under Georgia law, this right is not available when the affected shares are listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders unless:
(1) the articles of incorporation or a resolution of the board of directors approving the transaction provide otherwise; or (2) in a plan of merger or share exchange, the holders of such
shares are required to accept anything other than shares of the surviving corporation or another publicly held corporation which at the effective date of the merger or share exchange are either listed
on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, except for payments in lieu of fractional shares. For an additional discussion of dissenters' rights, see "The
Merger—Dissenters' Rights" beginning on page 70. 

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO THE ESHARE
  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN    

General  

    eshare shareholder approval of an amendment to the eshare (formerly Melita International Corporation) employee stock purchase plan is being sought by the
eshare board in order to ratify a previous increase in the total number of shares available for purchases under the plan from 250,000 to 301,760 in accordance with the requirement of
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, eshare employees have purchased 301,760 eshare common shares under the plan. The eshare
employee stock purchase plan will terminate upon the effectiveness of this amendment. eshare will not authorize any additional grants under the plan and divine will not be assuming the plan upon the
completion of the merger. 

Summary of the Plan  

    Melita International adopted the employee stock purchase plan on March 1, 1997, and it became effective on June 4, 1997. The plan is intended to
qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. An employee electing to participate in the plan must authorize on a semi-annual basis a stated dollar amount or percentage of
the employee's regular pay (not to exceed 10%) to be deducted by eshare from the employee's pay. The price at which employees may purchase shares is 85% of the closing price of eshare's common shares
on the Nasdaq National Market on the first day of the semi-annual period or the last day of the semi-annual period, whichever is lower. An employee may not sell eshare common
shares purchased under the plan until the first day of the second semi-annual period following the semi-annual period in which the right to purchase such shares was granted.
Employees of eshare whose customary employment is more than 20 hours per week for more than five months per calendar year are eligible to participate in the plan. An employee may not be granted
shares under the plan if after the granting of the shares the employee would be
deemed to own 5% or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of eshare securities. The plan is administered by the compensation committee of the eshare board. 

Amendment Regarding Number of Authorized Shares  

    Section 4(a) of the Plan has been amended by deleting the first sentence of the Plan in its entirety and substituting the following new sentence
therefor: 

    "(a)
The maximum number of shares that may be granted and purchased under the Plan may not exceed Three Hundred and One Thousand, Seven Hundred and Sixty (301,760) shares of Common
Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15), which may be authorized but unissued shares, re-acquired shares or shares bought on the open market." 

Federal Income Tax Treatment  

    Under current law, the following are U.S. federal income tax consequences generally arising with respect to awards under the plan: 

•
The
plan is intended to be an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under a plan that so
qualifies, no taxable 

income
is reportable by the participant either upon receipt of the purchase right at the time of entry into the purchase period or upon the actual purchase of shares on each purchase date. 

•
Shareholders
will recognize taxable income in the year in which there is a disposition of the purchased shares. The term "disposition" generally includes
any transfer of legal title, including a transfer by sale, exchange or gift, but does not include a transfer to a shareholder's spouse or a transfer into joint ownership if the original shareholder
remains as one of the joint owners.

•
Federal
income tax liability will depend on whether the shareholder makes a qualifying or disqualifying disposition of the purchased shares. A qualifying
disposition will occur if the sale or other disposition of those shares is made after the shareholder has held the shares for more than 2 years after the start of the purchase period in which
the shares were acquired. A disqualifying disposition is any sale or other disposition that is made prior to the satisfaction of the minimum holding period.

•
If
a disqualifying disposition is made, the shareholder will realize ordinary income in the year of the disqualifying disposition equal to the amount by
which the market price of the shares on the purchase date exceeded the purchase price. The amount of the ordinary income will then be added to the shareholder's basis in the shares, and any resulting
gain or loss recognized upon the disposition will be a capital gain or loss. The capital gain or loss will be long-term if the shares are held for more than 12 months.

•
If
a qualifying disposition is made, the shareholder will realize ordinary income in the year of the qualifying disposition equal to the lesser of the
amount by which the market price of the shares on the date of the qualifying disposition exceeds the purchase price or 15% of the market price of the shares on the start of the purchase period during
which those shares were purchased. This amount of ordinary income will be added to the shareholder's basis in the shares, and any additional gain recognized upon the qualifying disposition will be a
long-term capital gain. If the market price of the shares on the date of the qualifying disposition is less than the purchase price that the shareholder paid for the shares, there will be
no ordinary income and any loss recognized will be a long-term capital loss.

•
If
the purchased shares are the subject of a disqualifying disposition, eshare, or its successor, will be entitled to a deduction in the year of the
disqualifying disposition equal to the amount of ordinary income the shareholder recognizes upon the disposition. In no other event will a deduction be allowed to eshare. 

Vote Required  

    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the eshare special meeting will be required to approve the amendment to the eshare employee stock
purchase plan. 

THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ESHARE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 
FOR
 APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE ESHARE EMPLOYEE
STOCK PURCHASE PLAN TO RATIFY A PREVIOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ESHARE COMMON SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLAN FROM 250,000 TO 301,760 SHARES. 

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS    

    Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, shareholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in a company's proxy statement and
for consideration at the next annual meeting of its shareholders by submitting their proposals to the company in a timely manner. 

    eshare.
  As the result of the merger, eshare does not anticipate holding its 2002 annual meeting of shareholders.
Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at eshare's 2002 annual meeting of shareholders, if the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders is held, must be received on or before December 20,
2001 at eshare's executive offices located at 5051 Peachtree Corners Circle, Norcross, Georgia 30092, to be considered for inclusion in eshare's proxy materials for the 2002 annual meeting of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS    

To eshare communications, Inc. and Subsidiaries:  

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of eshare communications, Inc. (a Georgia corporation) and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive (loss) income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of eshare communications, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 1998 of eShare.com, Inc. (a Delaware corporation, and formerly eShare
Technologies, Inc.), a company acquired during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests, as discussed in Note 2. Such statements are included in the consolidated
financial statements of eshare communications, Inc. and subsidiaries and reflect total assets and total revenues of 4% and 4% in 1998, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. These
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts included for eShare.com, Inc., is based solely upon the report
of the other auditors. 

    We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

    In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of eshare communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

eshare communications, Inc. and Subsidiaries    

    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

    eshare communications, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading provider of Customer Interaction Management software applications. The Company's solutions
support voice, e-mail, live interaction/chat and hosting services for approximately 2,500 call center sites, e-businesses, ASPs, ISPs and Portals in approximately
30 countries. The Company's solutions enable real-time interactive communications and services, both voice based and over the Internet, and include customer service and support, customer
self-service, instant messaging, live conferencing and events, distance learning, community chat, threaded discussion forums and a variety of custom integration tools. Organizations use the Company's
applications and services to implement strategies for customer interaction that increase the value derived from their customers by enhancing customer acquisition and retention activities, while
reducing costs and improving agent productivity and effectiveness. The Company offers ongoing maintenance support of the Company's products. The Company also offers fee-based installation,
integration, training, hosting and consulting services. 

    The
Company, formerly eShare Technologies, Inc. was renamed eshare communications, Inc. on June 8, 2000. Prior to October 4, 1999, the Company was named
Melita International Corporation. 

Principles of Consolidation  

    The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. All prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc. in a pooling of interests transaction. 

Interim Unaudited Financial Statements  

    The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States applicable to interim financial statements. In the opinion of our management, these consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (which comprise only normal and recurring accruals)
necessary to present fairly the financial position as of March 31, 2001 and 2000. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of results
to be expected for the full year. 

Revenue Recognition  

    The Company generates product revenues primarily from the sale of integrated systems, which are comprised of both hardware and software and software licenses.
The Company's service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts that include support, parts, labor, and software update rights as well as fee-based installation, training, hosting, consulting
services and the licensing of patents. 

F–8

    The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition,"
as amended by SOP 98-9, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB101"), "Revenue Recognition" and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-03, "Application of AICPA SOP 97-2 to
Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity's Hardware." 

    The
Company recognizes product revenues when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the product has been delivered, the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of
the fee is probable. Revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contractual support period, which ranges from one to four years. Consulting revenues are primarily
related to extended services sold under separate service arrangements during the installation period. Revenues from consulting, hosting, installation, and training services are recognized as the
services are performed or over the hosting period, if applicable. In contracts where product and services are bundled together, revenue is allocated to each element with 100% of any discount going to
product. Certain of the Company's sales contracts provide for certain payment terms normally based upon signing the contract, customer receipt of the product, and commencement of operation of the
customer's system. 

    Revenues
from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contractual support period. If maintenance is included in the original contract, such
amounts are unbundled from the license fee based on the value established by the independent sale of such maintenance to customers. Consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services
performed under separate service arrangements related to the installation of the Company's hardware and software products. Revenues from consulting, installation, and training services are recognized
as the services are performed. Revenues from hosting arrangements are recognized over the hosting period. Revenues from patent settlements are recognized as other income when received. Revenues from
patent licenses are recognized per the contract terms and in accordance with SAB101. 

    Deferred
revenues primarily relate to products that have not yet been delivered and maintenance services, which have been paid by the customers prior to the performance of those
services. Deferred revenue amounted to $11.5 million, $8.3 million and $11.3 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999 and March 31, 2001, respectively. 

Capitalized Software Development Costs  

    Research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Software development costs are charged to research and development expense until
technological feasibility is established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, "Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed". The Company has defined technological feasibility of its products as the point in time at which the Company has a working model of the related product, which is when
the product has achieved "beta" status. Historically, the development costs incurred during the period between the achievement of beta status by a product and the point at which the product is
available for general release to customers have not been 

F–9

material. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that the amount of development costs capitalizable under the provisions of SFAS No. 86 was not material to the financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Therefore, the Company charged all software development costs to expense as incurred for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
and the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. 

Marketable Securities  

    The Company's marketable securities are categorized as available-for-sale securities, as defined by the SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. For the purpose of
computing realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis. Realized gains and losses were not material to the financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. 

    The
following table provides information about securities owned by us through our Melita Finance Corporation subsidiary that are sensitive to market risks by maturity as of
December 31, 2000 (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

    The book values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other financial instruments approximate their fair values at December 31, 2000 and 1999
and at March 31, 2001 principally because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. 

Property and Equipment  

    Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 

Furniture and fixtures

Five to seven years

Equipment

Three to seven years

Leasehold improvements

Remaining life of lease

    The Company's cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposition
is recognized in 

F–10

income. During 2000, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.4 million on the disposal of obsolete computer equipment. 

    Depreciation
expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 was $4.2 million,
$2.6 million, $2.5 million, $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets  

    The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The Company uses the undiscounted future cash flow to determine if an impairment loss is to be recognized. 

    In
accordance with SFAS No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.2 million in 2000
due to a write-down of purchased software. Based on the Company's evaluation of the future market potential and recoverability of this software product, which was made available to customers in 2000,
the Company wrote off the unamortized costs. 

Warranty Costs  

    The Company generally warranties its call center products for 90 days and its Internet products for 30 days and provides for estimated warranty
costs upon shipment of such products. Warranty costs have not been and are not anticipated to be significant. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

    The financial statements of the Company's European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency
Translation." Net assets of these
subsidiaries are translated at the current rates of exchange at December 31. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded in shareholders' equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in Other Income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has
recognized pre-tax foreign exchange (losses) gains of approximately $(43,000), $(49,000) and $16,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 

Income Taxes  

    The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes, as set forth in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the liability
method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the
years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefits of such assets
will not be realized. 

F–11

Basic and Diluted Net Earnings Per Share  

    Basic earnings per share are computed using net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding ("Weighted Shares") for the
period presented. 

    The
only difference between basic and diluted net earnings per share is the result of the treasury stock method effect of common equivalent shares ("CESs"). Diluted earnings per share
are computed using net income divided by the sum of (i) Weighted Shares and (ii) the
treasury stock method effect of CESs outstanding of 1,316,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The CESs for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were anti-dilutive and not considered in the calculation of
loss per share. 

Use of Estimates  

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

    In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The effective
date of SFAS No. 133 was delayed through the issuance of SFAS No. 137 and 138 to fiscal year 2001. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured based on their
fair values. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 and does not hold any significant derivative financial instruments; therefore, the adoption of this statement did not
have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. 

Reclassifications  

    Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 

Preferred Stock Preference  

    Included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 is a nonrecurring, non-cash charge of $5.8 million, which represents
the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock of eShare.com, Inc. at February 19, 1999 and the purchase price of certain Series C preferred stock issued on that
date. As part of the acquisition discussed below, the Series C preferred stock was converted to common stock. 

F–12

2.  ACQUISITIONS  

    On September 1, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc., a leading provider of real-time customer service and interactive
communication solutions for online communities. The shareholders of eShare.com, Inc. received 6,050,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The new combined company was renamed eShare
Technologies, Inc. on October 4, 1999. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests, therefore, all prior period amounts have been restated. A reconciliation between
revenue and net income as previously reported in fiscal 1998 and as restated follows:

    On June 15, 1999, the Company purchased smallwonder! softworks, Inc. of Leesburg, Virginia for $4.6 million in net cash and a prospective
earnout of up to an additional $3.0 million, based on achievement of certain defined criteria. During 2000, $1.0 million of the earnout was paid. During 1999, none of the earnout was
paid. The operations of smallwonders! softworks, Inc. are included in the accompanying statements from June 15, 1999. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.

4.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

    The Company allocated the intangible assets of approximately $4.7 million from the acquisition of smallwonder! softworks, Inc. to tradenames,
workforce and goodwill. The intangible assets are being amortized over a five-year period. Total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 was approximately
$1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Total amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million and $0.2 million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and as of March 31, 2001 was $1.5 million, $0.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

6.  NOTES PAYABLE  

    The Company had outstanding notes payable of approximately $0.2 million as of December 31, 1999. These notes were payable over 36 months and
required the Company to maintain certain financial covenants. In February of 1999, the Company issued 10% convertible notes for an aggregate amount of $0.5 million. These notes were
converted to equity in February of 1999. 

F–14

7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Lease Commitments  

    At December 31, 2000, the future minimum operating lease payments (including leases with related parties) under noncancellable operating leases were as

    The Company's leases are primarily for equipment and facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $2.0 million, $1.4 million and
$1.0 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. 

    The
Company has entered into lease agreements with a related party to lease land and buildings. One agreement provides for annual rentals of approximately $0.5 million to
$0.6 million per year over a ten-year term, which began in 1995. The other agreement provides for annual rentals of approximately $0.5 million per year over a fifteen-year term. Total
rent
expense, under both agreements, paid to the related party was $1.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. 

Legal Matters  

    Many of the Company's installations involve products that are critical to the operations of its clients' businesses. Any failure in a Company product could
result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company's responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to limit contractually its liability for
damages arising from product failures or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances. 

    The
Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen, in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of potential liability with
respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 

F–15

8.  STOCK OPTION PLANS  

    During 1992, the Company approved a stock option plan (the "1992 Plan") for key employees for which 640,000 shares of common stock were authorized for use in
the Plan. During 1995, the number of authorized shares was increased to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. Options are granted at the fair market value and are exercisable based on the specific
terms of the grant up to ten years from the grant date. Options granted primarily vest ratably over a four-year or five-year employment period. 

    On
February 6, 1997, the Company approved the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan") for which 1,350,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance, less any options
issued under the 1992 Plan. In October of 1997, the Company increased the number of shares available under the 1997 Plan to 1,850,000. On May 11, 1998, the shareholders approved an
amendment to the 1997 Plan whereby the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan will automatically be adjusted on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with
1998, by a number of shares such that the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan equals the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares previously issued under the 1997
Plan and the 1992 Plan, (ii) the aggregate number of shares subject to then outstanding or authorized options granted under the 1997 Plan and the 1992 Plan, and (iii) 5% of the number of
shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year. Options are granted at the fair market value and are exercisable based on the specific terms of the grant up to ten
years from the grant date. The options vest primarily over a four-year period subject to acceleration upon the achievement of certain performance measures. 

    In
October 1996, eShare.com, Inc. approved, as amended, a stock option and restricted stock purchase plan (the "1996 Plan") for which 2,300,000 shares of common stock
were originally authorized for issuance. Upon the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc. the 1996 Plan options were converted into options for the common stock of eshare communications, Inc. as
adjusted by the acquisition conversion ratio. The activity of the 1996 Plan, as audited, has been added to the option activity listed below. No additional options will be granted under the 1996 Plan. 

    In
1999 and 1998, eShare.com, Inc. granted options from the 1996 Plan at exercise prices below the fair market value on the date of grant. The excess of the fair value of the
common stock over the exercise price was approximately $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively,
which was recorded as deferred compensation and was amortized over the vesting period. These options vested immediately upon the change in control of the Company on September 1, 1999. In
connection with the merger with eShare.com, Inc., the Company incurred $2.3 million (non-cash) of indirect deferred compensation expenses related to the conversion of the
eShare.com, Inc. stock option plan.

    During, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123, which defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock
option plan or similar equity instrument. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income 

F–17

and, if presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value-based method of accounting defined in the statement had been applied. 

    The
Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plan under APB No. 25; however, the Company has computed for pro forma disclosure purposes the value of
all options granted during 1996 and 1997 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 using the following weighted assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999, and
1998:

    The total value of the options granted during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 were computed as approximately $7.4 million,
$14.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively, which would be amortized over the vesting period of the options. If the Company had accounted for these plans in accordance with SFAS
No. 123, the Company's reported net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 would have (increased) decreased to the following

    Under the Company's 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), the Company is authorized to sell up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustments
for changes in the Company's capitalization) to full-time employees. Per the terms of the ESPP, employees may elect to have up to 10% of their annual compensation withheld to purchase the Company's
Common Stock at 85% of the fair market value. Fair market value is the price of the Common Stock on the preceding trading day of purchase. 

9.  BENEFIT PLAN  

    The Company has a defined contribution profit-sharing plan (the "Plan") for substantially all employees meeting the eligibility requirements as defined in the
plan agreement. The Plan provides for annual contributions by the Company at the discretion of the board of directors. 

F–18

The Plan also contains a 401(k) feature which allows participants to contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation, as defined, and provides for discretionary employer matching contributions.
Total contributions by the Company to the Plan were approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. 

10. INCOME TAXES

    As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $23.3 million and $12.8 million,
respectively, which expire through 2020. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company has established a partial valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since a significant portion
of these tax loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations under the change in stock ownership imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. 

11. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  

    Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets for which the Company's services
are provided as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. As a result, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company did not consider itself to have any significant
concentrations of credit risk. During 2000, no customers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues. During 1999, only First USA Bank, at 11.0%, accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues.
In 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately
16.6%, 28.2% and 23.2%, respectively, of total revenues. These sales were predominantly to customers in the financial services industry. Although the particular customers may change from period to
period, the Company expects that large sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of its revenues in any particular period for the foreseeable future. 

12. SEGMENT INFORMATION  

    In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS
No. 131 establishes standards for the way public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires the presentation of descriptive information
about reportable segments which is consistent with that made available to the management of the Company to assess performance. 

    The
Company is a multinational business operating in two segments, telephony and Internet. The Company's management primarily evaluates these segments on income from 

F–20

operations. The telephony business segment includes the sale of hardware and software for telephone call centers in all geographic areas, including inbound/outbound voice contact management. The
Internet business segment includes the sale of software such as NetAgent and Expressions in all geographic areas. The results of these segments are as follows (in thousands):

    THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING

ARTICLE IV

    MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF
  SHARES IN THE MERGER    

    4.1
  Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares in the Merger.
  At the
Effective Time, the manner of converting or canceling shares of the Company and Parent shall be as follows: 

    (a)
  Conversion of Company Stock.
  Subject to adjustment, if applicable, pursuant to Sections
4.1(e) and 4.1(f) hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.3 hereof, each share of common stock, no par value ("Company Shares"), of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Company Shares described in Section 4.1(d)), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted automatically into the right to receive 1.30 shares of Class A common stock, $0.001 par value, of Parent ("Parent Shares"). All Company Shares to be converted into Parent Shares
pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such Company Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive for each of the Company
Shares, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 4.2, the number of Parent Shares specified above and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The ratio of Company Shares per share
of Parent Shares, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Sections 4.1(e) and 4.1(f) hereof, is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio." 

    (b)
  Stock of Merger Sub.
  Each stock certificate representing shares of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to represent ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

    (c)
  Outstanding Options.
  Prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Shares (each, a
"Company Option") that is outstanding and unexercised pursuant to the Company Option Plans in effect on the date hereof shall (i) be terminated if the result of dividing (A) the exercise
price of such Company Option by (B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the result to the nearest tenth of one cent (hereinafter, the "Post-Merger Exercise Price"), is greater than the closing sale
price of the Parent Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) if the Post-Merger Exercise Price of such Company Option is less than or equal to the closing
sale price of the Parent Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time, become and represent an option to purchase (a "Substitute Option") the number of Parent Shares (rounded to
the nearest full share) determined by multiplying (X) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (Y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise
price per share of Parent Shares equal to the Post-Merger Exercise Price. It is the intent of the Parties that the Substitute Options shall qualify following the Effective Time as "incentive stock
options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent that the related Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the provisions of
this Section 4.1(c) shall be applied consistent with such intent. Parent shall 

A–3

pay cash to holders of Company Options in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Shares upon the exercise of Substitute Options for Parent Shares. After the Effective Time, except as provided above in this
Section 4.1(c), each Substitute Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time after
giving effect to any provision contained in such Company Option providing for accelerated vesting as a result of this Agreement. The Company agrees that, after the date of this Agreement, it will not
grant any stock appreciation rights or limited stock appreciation rights and will not permit cash payments to holders of Company Options in lieu of the substitution therefor of Substitute Options, as
described in this Section 4.1(c). Parent will reserve a sufficient number of Parent Shares (i) for issuance under this Section 4.1(c) and (ii) for issuance under
Section 6.18. 

    (d)
  Cancellation of Parent Owned and Treasury Stock.
  All of the Company Shares that are owned by
Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or by the Company as treasury stock shall automatically cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
Parent Shares shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

    (e)
  Adjustment to Exchange Ratio.
  If the Average Market Value of Parent Shares is $2.82 or greater,
then the Exchange Ratio (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4.1(f), if applicable) shall be adjusted to an amount equal to $3.653 divided by the Average Market Value of Parent Shares.
If the Average Market Value of Parent Shares is $2.39 or less, then the Exchange Ratio (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4.1(f), if applicable) shall be adjusted to an amount equal
to $3.12 divided by the greater of (x) the Average Market Value of Parent Shares or (y) $1.00. If the number of Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger pursuant to the adjustment set forth in the
foregoing sentence exceeds 28,546,506 Parent Shares (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4.1(f), if applicable), then Parent may elect to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the
Parent Shares otherwise issuable to Company shareholders in the Merger in excess of 28,546,506 Parent Shares (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1(f), if applicable), in an amount per share
equal to the Average Market Value of Parent Shares (the "Cash Adjustment Payment"), provided that such election is made prior to the date on which the Proxy Statement with respect to the Company
Shareholders Meeting is first mailed to the Company's shareholders, or on a later date so long as the timing of such election shall not cause the Closing Date contemplated in the Proxy Statement with
respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting to be delayed. 

    (f)
  Adjustment for Organic Changes.
  In the event of any reclassification, stock split or stock dividend
with respect to Parent Shares, any change or conversion of Parent Shares into other securities or any other dividend or distribution in Parent Shares with respect to outstanding Parent Shares (or if a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur) prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and all references
to the Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted. 

A–4

    4.2
  Payment for Shares in the Merger.
  The manner of making payment for Shares in the Merger shall be as
follows: 

    (a)
  Exchange Agent.
  On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to Computershare
Investor Services, LLC, or other entity mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, a sufficient number of certificates
representing the Parent Shares required to effect the delivery of the aggregate consideration in Parent Shares, cash for the Fractional Securities Fund and the Cash Adjustment Payment, if any,
required to be issued pursuant to Section 4.1 (collectively, the "Share Consideration" and the certificates representing the Parent Shares comprising such aggregate Share Consideration being
referred to hereinafter as the "Stock Merger Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Share
Consideration out of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund. The Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
as set forth in this Agreement. 

    (b)
  Exchange Procedures.
  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the "Certificates") (i) a form of letter of transmittal,
in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Subject to Section 4.5, upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and any other required documents, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive for each of the Company Shares represented by such Certificates the Share Consideration, without interest, allocable to such Certificates and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, such Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the Share Consideration allocable to such Certificates. 

    (c)
  Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
  No dividends or other distributions that are
declared after the Effective Time on Parent Shares and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time will be paid to Persons entitled by reason of the Merger to receive Parent
Shares until such Persons surrender their Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(b) above. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Parent Shares are
issued any dividends or other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time and payable with respect to such Parent Shares between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender.
After such surrender there shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Parent Shares are issued any dividends or other distributions on such Parent Shares which shall have a record date after the
date of such surrender. In no event shall the Persons entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions. 

    (d)
  Transfers of Ownership.
  If any certificate representing Parent Shares is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or 

A–5

other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such Parent Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

    (e)
  No Liability.
  Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the Parties shall be liable to a holder of
Company Shares for any Parent Shares, Cash Adjustment Payment, if any, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares or any dividend to which the holders thereof are entitled, that are delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable escheat law. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Shares held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such Parent Shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

    (f)
  Termination of Funds.
  Subject to applicable law, any portion of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund, the
Cash Adjustment Payment, if any, and the Fractional Securities Fund that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former shareholder of the Company shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their applicable claim for the Share Consideration for their Company
Shares. 

    4.3
  Cash for Fractional Parent Shares.
  No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in the Merger. Each
holder of Parent Shares shall be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled pursuant to Section 4.2 (after taking into
account all Parent Shares then held of record by such holder) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the fractional interest of a Parent Share to which such holder otherwise
would have been entitled and (ii) the closing sale price of a Parent Share on the Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (the cash comprising
such aggregate payments in lieu of fractional Parent Shares being hereinafter referred to as the "Fractional Securities Fund"). 

    4.4
  Transfer of Shares after the Effective Time.
  All Share Consideration issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Company Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares, and no further registration of transfers shall be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article IV. 

    4.5
  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
  In the event any Certificates evidencing Company Shares
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Parent Shares, cash for fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a customary bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

practices; (iv) any material revaluation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its assets, including, without limitation, writing down the value of capitalized software or inventory or

be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will (i) in the case of the S-4 Registration Statement, at the time it
becomes effective or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting and Parent
Stockholders Meeting (if necessary) and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

Registration Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company, such event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. The S-4 Registration Statement will (with respect to Parent and Merger Sub) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act. The Proxy Statement will (with respect to Parent and Merger Sub) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles through the date of the Parent Financial Statements.

Taxes not yet due and payable.

thereto. In such event, the Company shall, (i) promptly inform Parent of the material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) promptly keep Parent informed of the status including any material change to the terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term
"Company Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any (i) merger, consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company in one or more transactions, (iii) issuance, sale, or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase such securities, or securities convertible into such securities) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, (iv) liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, (v) tender offer or exchange offer for Company securities; in
the case of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, which transaction would result in a third party (or its shareholders) acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
Company or the assets representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the net income, net revenue or assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, (vi) transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or (vii) public announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing, 

provided, however
, that the term
"Company Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal" means any offer not solicited after the date of this Agreement by the Company, or by other persons in violation of the first sentence of this
Section 6.2(a), and made by a third party to consummate a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or similar transaction which would result in such third party (or its shareholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company Shares then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together, and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (based on its consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and considering such other matters that it deems relevant) would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's shareholders from a financial point of
view than the Merger and, taking into account, in the reasonable 

A–35

good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with its financial advisor, the availability to the person or entity making such Company Superior
Proposal of the financial means to conclude such transaction. The Company will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing. 

    (b) Neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, except as required by their fiduciary duties as determined in good faith (in reliance
on the opinion of its outside counsel), (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors
of the Company or such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve, recommend, or otherwise support or endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the
Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (in reliance upon the opinion of its outside counsel), such disclosure is necessary for the Board of
Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 
provided, however
, that, except as required by their fiduciary duties as determined
in good faith and in reliance upon the opinion of its outside counsel, neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal. 

    (c) In
addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.2, the Company will promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent, orally and in writing, if any Company Acquisition Proposal is made or, to its Knowledge, proposed to be made or any information or access to
properties, books or records of the Company is requested in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal, the principal terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or potential
Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (and will disclose any written materials received by the Company in connection with such Company Acquisition Proposal, potential Company Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry) and the identity of the party making such Company Acquisition Proposal, potential Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent advised of the status and details
(including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such request or Company Acquisition Proposal.

recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company or such committee of this Agreement or the Merger. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3(a) shall prohibit the Company from making
any disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (in reliance upon the opinion of its outside counsel), such disclosure is necessary
for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company shall deliver to Parent, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement executed by Szlam.

Agreement and the Merger. Neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall, except as required by their fiduciary duties as determined in good faith (in reliance on the opinion
of its outside counsel), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors of Parent or such committee
of this Agreement or the Merger. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3(b) shall prohibit Parent from making any disclosure to Parent's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the

SEC a proxy statement that will be the same proxy statement/prospectus contained in the S-4 Registration Statement and a form of proxy, in connection with the vote of the Company's (and Parent's, if
necessary) shareholders, or stockholders, as applicable, with respect to the Merger (such proxy statement/prospectus, together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, in each case in the
form or forms mailed to the Company's (and Parent's, if necessary) shareholders, or stockholders, as applicable, is herein called the "Proxy Statement"). The Company and Parent will, and will cause
their accountants and lawyers to, use their reasonable efforts to have or cause the S-4
Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable thereafter, including, without limitation, causing their accountants to deliver necessary or required instruments such as opinions,
consents and certificates, and will take any other action required or necessary to be taken under federal or state securities laws or otherwise in connection with the registration process, it being

Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for
the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b), Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent or the Company is entitled to receive the Termination Fee, (i) the obligation to pay the
Termination Fee shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent or the Company, as
applicable, except in the event of (A) a willful breach by the defaulting party of any provision of this Agreement or (B) an intentional or knowing misrepresentation in connection with
this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in which event the party entitled to the Termination Fee shall have all rights, powers and remedies against the other party that may be available at law or in equity.
All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any such right,

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the date hereof), collectively, do not own more than an aggregate of one percent (1%) of the stock of such corporation. 

    10.3  The
parties acknowledge that the business of the Company is and will be international in scope and thus the covenants in this Section 10
would be particularly ineffective if the covenants were to be limited to the United States or a particular geographic area of the United States. If any court of competent jurisdiction at any time
deems the Restricted Period unreasonably lengthy, or the Restricted Territory unreasonably extensive, or any of the covenants set forth in Section 10 not fully enforceable, the other provisions
of Section 10, and this Employment Agreement in general, will nevertheless stand and to the full extent consistent with law continue in full force and effect, and it is the intention and desire
of the parties that the court treat any provisions of this Employment Agreement which are not fully enforceable as having been modified to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render them
reasonable and enforceable and that the court enforce them to such extent (for example, that the Restricted Period be deemed to be the longest period permissible by law, but not in excess of the
length provided for in Section 10.2, and the Restricted Territory be deemed to comprise the largest territory permissible by law under the circumstances but not in excess of the territory provided for
in Section 10.2). 

    11.
  Return of Company Materials Upon Termination.
  Employee acknowledges that all records, documents,
and "Tangible Embodiments" containing or of "Proprietary Information" (as such terms are defined in the document attached as ANNEX I) prepared by Employee or coming into Employee's possession by
virtue of Employee's employment by the Company are and will remain the property of the Company. Upon termination of Employee's employment with the Company, Employee shall immediately return to the
Company all such items in Employee's possession and all copies of such items, as well as any other property of the Company. 

    12.
  Equitable Remedies.

    12.1 Employee
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements and covenants set forth in Sections 9, 10 and 11 are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the
Company's business interests, that irreparable injury will result to the Company if Employee breaches any of the terms of said covenants, and that in the event of Employee's actual or threatened
breach of any such covenants, the Company will have no adequate remedy at law. Employee accordingly agrees that, in the event of any actual or threatened breach by Employee of any of said covenants,
the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages. Nothing in this Section 12 will be
construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of any damages that it is able to prove. 

C–A–4

    12.2  Each of the covenants in Sections 9, 10 and 11 will be construed as independent of any other covenants or other provisions of this Employment
Agreement. 

    12.3  In
the event of any judicial determination that any of the covenants in Sections 9, 10 and 11 are not fully enforceable, it is the intention and
desire of the parties that the court treat said covenants as having been modified to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render them reasonable and enforceable, and that the court enforce them
to such extent. 

    13.
  Termination.

    13.1 The
Company may terminate the Employment Term immediately upon written notice to Employee if there has been a material breach of this Employment Agreement by
Employee. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any breach by Employee of any of Employee's obligations under Sections 9, 10 and 11 will be deemed a material breach of this
Employment Agreement, and any of the following events will also be deemed a material breach of this Employment Agreement: 

    (a) Employee's
continued and deliberate neglect of, willful misconduct in connection with the performance of or refusal to perform Employee's duties in accordance with,
Section 3 of this Employment Agreement; or 

    (b) Employee's
commission of an act or acts constituting a felony or other crime of moral turpitude; or 

    (c) Employee's
engagement in willful misconduct that causes or is likely to cause a financial injury to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, Employee's embezzlement of the funds of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or theft of the property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or fraud against the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or any of their customers. 

    If
the Employment Term is terminated by the Company pursuant to this Section 13.1 or in accordance with Section 2, the Company shall have no further obligation hereunder
or otherwise with respect to Employee (except payment of Employee's Base Salary under Section 5.1, subject to Section 5.3 hereof, and benefits under Section 6 accrued through the
date of termination). 

    13.2  The
Employment Term will terminate upon the death or upon written notice from the Company to Employee upon the Disability (as defined below) of
Employee. "Disability" of Employee will be deemed to have occurred whenever Employee has suffered physical or mental illness, injury, or infirmity that prevents Employee from performing, with or
without reasonable accommodation, Employee's essential job functions under this Employment Agreement for any ninety (90) days in any one hundred twenty (120) day period and the Company determines in
good faith that such illness or other disability is likely to continue for at least the next following thirty (30) days. Employee's salary prior to the Disability of Employee will be reduced by any
benefits Employee receives from disability insurance provided by the Company or pursuant to a plan providing disability benefits maintained by the Company (if any such insurance or plan exists). In
the event of termination due to death or Disability, the Employee shall be deemed to have earned the pro rata portion of any bonus for the then current year based on the date of death or onset of the
applicable illness, injury or infirmity. The Company 

C–A–5

shall maintain an insurance policy or policies for the benefit of Employee which shall pay Employee or Employee's estate or legal representative, as applicable, in the event of the death or Disability
of Employee, an amount equal to the balance, if any, which would be payable by the Company to Employee under the remaining original Employment Term (without giving effect to any deemed shortening of
the Employment Term as a result of such termination) if such death or Disability shall not have occurred; 
provided, however
, that the Company shall only
be obligated to provide and maintain such insurance policy if Employee undergoes and, in the reasonable judgement of the Company's insurance provider, passes such reasonable physical examinations as
may be required, from time to time, by the Company's
insurance provider. Except as set forth in the preceding two sentences, if the Employment Term is terminated pursuant to this Section 13.2, the Company shall have no further obligation
hereunder or otherwise with respect to Employee (except payment of Employee's Base Salary under Section 5.1, subject to Section 5.3 hereof, and benefits under Section 6 accrued
through the date of termination). 

    13.3  The
Company may elect to terminate Employee's employment hereunder without cause upon ten (10) days' prior written notice; provided that if
it does so elect the Company shall continue to pay Employee's Base Salary in accordance with Section 5.1, subject to Section 5.3 hereof, Bonus in accordance with Section 5.2,
subject to Section 5.3 hereof, and provide the benefits to Employee in accordance with Section 6 until the last day of the Employment Term as originally specified in Section 2
(without giving effect to any deemed shortening of the Employment Term as a result of such termination). Except as specifically set forth in this Section 13.3, if the Employment Term is
terminated pursuant to this Section 13.3, the Company shall have no further obligation hereunder or otherwise with respect to Employee. 

    13.4  Employee
has the power to terminate Employee's employment with the Company without cause, in which event the Company shall have no further
obligation hereunder or otherwise with respect to Employee (except payment of Employee's Base Salary under Section 5.1 and benefits under Section 6 accrued through the date of
termination). 

    13.5  Termination
of the Employment Term in accordance with this Section 13, or expiration of the Employment Term, will not affect the provisions
of this Employment Agreement that survive such termination, including, without limitation, the provisions in Sections 9, 10 and 11 and will not limit either party's ability to pursue remedies
at law or equity. 

    13.6  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no payments shall be due under Section 13.3 above unless and until Employee shall have
executed a general release and waiver of claims of Employee against the Company under this Agreement or relating to Employee's employment hereunder, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and
the execution of such general release and waiver of claims shall be a condition to Employee's rights under Section 13.3.

July 8, 2001 

Board
of Directors

1301 N. Elston Avenue

Chicago, Illinois 60622 

Members
of the Board: 

    We
understand that eshare communications, Inc. (the "Company"), divine, inc. ("Acquiror") and DES Acquisition Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror, "Merger
Sub") are proposing to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") which will provide, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into the Merger Sub.
Under the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in a draft of the Agreement dated July 8, 2001 (the "Draft Agreement"), at the effective time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company, no par value ("Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares, currently calculated at 2.080 shares (assuming all merger
consideration is paid in Acquiror Common Stock, such current amount being the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock of Acquiror, par value $0.001 per share ("Acquiror Common Stock"), determined as set
forth in the Draft Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are set out more fully in the Draft Agreement. 

    You
have asked us whether, in our opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof to Acquiror. 

    For
purposes of this opinion we have, among other things: 

(i)
reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company and Acquiror, respectively;

(ii)
reviewed
with the Company and Acquiror certain publicly available research estimates of research analysts regarding the Company and Acquiror;

(iii)
held
discussions with the respective managements of the Company and Acquiror concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
condition (including certain forward looking information, concerning the Company and the Acquiror) and future prospects of both the Company and Acquiror, independently and combined, including
discussions with the managements of the Company and Acquiror concerning their views regarding the strategic rationale for the Merger;

(iv)
reviewed
the financial terms and conditions set forth in the Draft Agreement;

(v)
reviewed
the stock price and trading history of Company Common Stock and Acquiror Common Stock; 

E–1

(vi)
compared
the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly
traded companies comparable with the Company;

(vii)
compared
the financial terms of the Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions that we deemed
relevant;

(viii)
reviewed
certain diligence materials prepared for the management of Acquiror; and

(ix)
made
such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as we deemed relevant. 

    In
our review and analysis, and in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information provided to us
(including information furnished to us orally or otherwise discussed with us by the managements of the Company and Acquiror) or publicly available and have neither attempted to verify, nor assumed
responsibility for verifying, any of such information. We have relied upon the assurances of the managements of the Company and Acquiror that they are not aware of any facts that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, we did not obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any independent evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Acquiror, nor were we furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the performance and prospects of the Company that we have
discussed, we have assumed that the Acquiror and the Company managements' views regarding the combined company's performance and prospects were arrived at in good faith, were based on reasonable
assumptions regarding the future financial condition and performance of the Company and reflect the best currently available judgments of the managements of Acquiror and the Company, respectively, and
we have further assumed that such performance will be realized as anticipated by such management. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the Draft Agreement
without material alteration thereof, including, among other things, that the Merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") and that the Merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, we have assumed that
the historical financial statements of each of the Company and Acquiror reviewed by us have been prepared and fairly presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied. 

    This
opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as in effect on, and information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in this opinion and that we disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any matter affecting this opinion
which may come or be brought to our attention after the date of this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as to the 

E–2

date hereof, to Acquiror of the Exchange Ratio. We do not express any opinion as to (i) the value of any stockholder, non-competition or employee agreements or other arrangements
entered into in connection with the Merger, (ii) any tax or other consequences that might result from the Merger or (iii) what the value of Acquiror Common Stock will be when issued to
the Company's stockholders pursuant to the Merger or the price at which shares of Acquiror Common Stock may be traded in the future. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger and
the other business strategies that Acquiror's Board of Directors has considered or may be considering, nor does it address the decision of Acquiror's Board of Directors to proceed with the Merger.
Neither does our opinion address any legal or accounting matters, as to which we understand that Acquiror obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. 

    We
will receive a fee contingent upon the delivery of this opinion, and Acquiror has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement. We were the
lead underwriters for the initial public offering of Acquiror and are currently engaged by Acquiror under a retainer agreement. We maintain a market in the shares of Acquiror Common Stock. In the
ordinary course of business, we may trade in Acquiror's securities and the Company's securities for our own account and the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in Acquiror's securities or the Company's securities. 

    Our
opinion expressed herein is provided for the information of the Board of Directors of Acquiror in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Our opinion is not intended to be
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Acquiror or the Company as to how such stockholder should vote, or take any other action, with respect to the Merger. This opinion may
not be summarized, described or referred to or furnished to any party except with our express prior written consent. 

    Based
upon and subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Acquiror from a financial point of view. 

Very
truly yours,

5051 Peachtree Corners Circle

Norcross, GA 30092 

Dear
Members of the Board: 

    We
understand that eshare communications, Inc. ("eshare" or the "Company"), divine, inc. ("divine" or "Parent") and DES Acquisition Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the
Merger, each share of eshare common stock ("Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive 1.30 shares of Parent class A common stock ("Parent Common Stock") provided,
however, that (i) if the Average Market Value (as defined in the Agreement) of shares of Parent Common Stock is $2.82 or greater then the exchange ratio will be adjusted to an amount equal to
$3.653 divided by the Average Market Value of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) if the Average Market Value of shares of Parent Common Stock is $2.39 or less then the exchange ratio will
be adjusted to an amount equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of (x) the Average Market Value of shares of Parent Common Stock or
(y) $1.00, and provided further, that if the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger pursuant to the adjustment set forth above exceeds 28,546,506 shares, then Parent
may elect to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable in the Merger in excess of 28,546,506 shares. We also understand that, in connection with
the Merger, Parent and Mr. Aleksander Szlam, Chairman of eshare's Board and majority shareholder of eshare, have agreed to certain additional transactions with respect to, among other things,
shares in eshare beneficially owned by Mr. Szlam and his affiliates. 

    The
Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The terms and conditions
of the above described Merger are more fully detailed in the Agreement. 

    You
have requested our opinion as to whether the consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. 

    Broadview
International LLC ("Broadview") focuses on providing merger and acquisition advisory services to information technology ("IT"), communications and media companies. In this
capacity, we are continually engaged in valuing such businesses, and we maintain an extensive database of IT, communications and media mergers and acquisitions for comparative purposes. We are
currently acting as financial advisor to eshare's Board of Directors and will receive a fee from eshare upon the successful conclusion of the Merger. We understand that Mr. Szlam and
Mr. Andrew J. Filipowski have recused themselves from voting as Company Board members on matters relating to the Merger. 

F–1

    In rendering our opinion, we have, among other things: 

1)
reviewed
the terms of the Agreement in the form of the draft dated July 7, 2001 furnished to us on July 7, 2001 by divine counsel, the
Stockholder Agreement between divine and Szlam Partners, L.P. in the form of the draft dated July 7, 2001 furnished to us on July 7, 2001 by divine counsel, and the Employment Agreement
between Mr. Szlam and divine in the form of the draft dated July 8, 2001 furnished to us on July 8, 2001 by divine counsel (which, for the purposes of this opinion, we have
assumed, with your permission, to be identical in all material respects to the agreements to be executed);

2)
reviewed
eshare's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, including the audited financial
statements included therein, and eshare's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2001, including the unaudited financial statements included therein;

3)
reviewed
certain internal financial and operating information for eshare, including quarterly projections through December 31, 2002, prepared
and furnished to us by eshare management;

4)
participated
in discussions with eshare management concerning the operations, business strategy, current financial performance and prospects for
eshare;

5)
discussed
with eshare management its view of the strategic rationale for the Merger;

6)
reviewed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock;

7)
compared
certain aspects of the financial performance of eshare with public companies we deemed comparable;

8)
analyzed
available information, both public and private, concerning other mergers and acquisitions we believe to be comparable in whole or in part to
the Merger;

9)
reviewed
recent equity research analyst reports covering eshare;

10)
reviewed
divine's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, including the audited financial
statements included therein, and divine's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2001, including the unaudited financial statements included therein;

11)
reviewed
certain internal financial and operating information for divine, including quarterly projections through December 31, 2002, prepared
and furnished to us by divine management;

12)
participated
in discussions with divine management concerning the operations, business strategy, financial performance and prospects for divine;

13)
reviewed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Parent Common Stock;

14)
discussed
with divine management its view of the strategic rationale for the Merger;

15)
compared
certain aspects of the financial performance of divine with public companies we deemed comparable; 

F–2

16)
reviewed
recent equity analyst reports covering divine;

17)
analyzed
the anticipated effect of the Merger on the future financial performance of divine;

18)
assisted
in negotiations and discussions related to the Merger among eshare, divine and their respective advisors; and

19)
conducted
other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate for purposes of this opinion. 

    In
rendering our opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information (including without limitation
the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement) that was publicly available or furnished to us by eshare or divine. With respect to the financial projections examined by us,
we have assumed that they were reasonably prepared and reflected the best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of eshare and divine as to the future performance of eshare and
divine, respectively. We have neither made nor obtained an independent appraisal or valuation of any of eshare's assets. 

    Based
upon and subject to the foregoing and subject to the limitations and assumptions below, we are of the opinion that the consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of
Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. 

    For
purposes of this opinion, we have assumed that neither eshare nor divine is currently involved in any material transaction other than the Merger, other publicly announced
transactions, any other transactions of which we are aware, and those activities undertaken in the ordinary course of conducting their respective businesses. Our opinion is necessarily based upon
market, economic, financial and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated as of the date of this opinion, and any change in such conditions would require a reevaluation of this opinion. We
express no opinion as to the price at which Parent Common Stock will trade at any time in the future. Finally, in rendering this opinion, with your permission, we have not taken into account the land
option granted to Parent by Mr. Szlam. However, this will confirm that we have taken into account the financial terms of the other additional transactions between Parent and Mr. Szlam. 

    This
opinion speaks only as of the date hereof. It is understood that this opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of eshare in connection with its consideration of
the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any eshare shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Merger. This opinion may not be published or referred to, in
whole or part, without our prior written permission, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Broadview hereby consents to references to and the inclusion of this opinion in its entirety in the
eshare Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be distributed to eshare shareholders in connection with the Merger. 

Sincerely,

/s/

JUDICIAL APPRAISAL OF SHARES    

14-2-1330—Court action.  

    (a) If
a demand for payment under 
Code Section 14-2-1327 
remains unsettled, the
corporation shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the

    (b) The
corporation shall commence the proceeding, which shall be a nonjury equitable valuation proceeding, in the superior court of the county where a corporation's
registered office is located. If the surviving corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the
registered office of the domestic corporation merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was located. 

    (c) The
corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding, which shall have the
effect of an action quasi in rem against their shares. The corporation shall serve a copy of the petition in the proceeding upon each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state in the
manner provided by law for the service of a summons and complaint, and upon each nonresident dissenting shareholder either by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery or by
publication, or in any other manner permitted by law. 

    (d) The
jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (b) of this Code section is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint
one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them or in any amendment to
it. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, Chapter 11 of Title 9, known as the "Georgia Civil Practice Act," applies to any proceeding with respect to dissenters' rights under this chapter. 

    (e) Each

date of judgment.

parties. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent
the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment under 
Code
Section 14-2-1327.

    (b) The
court may also assess the fees and expenses of attorneys and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable: 

(1)
Against
the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of 
Code
Sections 14-2-1320 
through 
14-2-1327; 
or

(2)
Against
either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily,
vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article. 

    (c) If
the court finds that the services of attorneys for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those
services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to these attorneys reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited. 

14-2-1332—Limitation of actions.  

    No action by any dissenter to enforce dissenters' rights shall be brought more than three years after the corporate action was taken, regardless of whether
notice of the corporate action and of the right to dissent was given by the corporation in compliance with the provisions of 
Code
Section 14-2-1320 
and 
Code Section 14-2-1322.

Item 22.  Undertakings.  

    We hereby undertake as follows: 

    (1) To
file, during any period in which any offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement: 

(i)
To
include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;

(ii)
To
reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set 

II–3

forth
in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that
which was registered) may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more
than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement. 

(iii)
To
include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material
change to such information in the registration statement. 

    (2) That,
for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 

    (3) To
remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
offering. 

    (4) That,
for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 

    (5) Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 

    (6) That
prior to any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part of this registration statement, by any person
or party who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the information called for by the applicable
registration form with respect to reofferings by persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called for by the other items of the applicable form. 

    (7) That
every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant to paragraph (6) immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to meet the requirements
of Section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is used in connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be filed as a part of 

II–4

an amendment to the registration statement and will not be used until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to
be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 

    (8) To
respond to requests for information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this Form, within one business
day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent to the
effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request. 

    (9) To
supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not
the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became effective.

OPINION OF KATTEN MUCHIN & ZAVIS RE: SECURITIES

                                                                  (312) 902-5200

                  RE:   REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          We have acted as counsel for divine, inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration
statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"). The Registration Statement relates to the Company's
issuance of up to 73,737,980 shares of its Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par
value per share (the "Shares"), in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of July 8, 2001 (the "Agreement"), by and among the Company,
DES Acquisition Company ("DES") and eshare communications, Inc. ("eshare"),
pursuant to which eshare will be merged with and into DES (the "Merger"). This
opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5)
of Regulation S-K under the Act.

          In connection with this opinion, we have relied as to matters of fact,
without investigation, upon certificates of public officials and others and upon
affidavits, certificates and written statements of directors, officers and
employees of, and the accountants and transfer agent for, the Company. We have
also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction, of such instruments, documents and records as we have deemed
relevant and necessary to examine for the purpose of this opinion, including (a)
the Registration Statement, (b) the Company's Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as subsequently amended, (c) the Company's Amended
and Restated By-laws, (d) minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the
Company, (e) the Agreement and (f) a specimen certificate representing the Class
A Common Stock.

          In connection with this opinion, we have assumed the legal capacity of
all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all documents and records
that we have reviewed, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of
the documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
reproduced copies.

divine, inc.
August 1, 2001
Page 2

          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, when
the Merger is consummated in accordance with the Agreement and the Shares are
delivered in exchange for eshare Common Shares as contemplated by the Agreement,
the Shares issued in the Merger will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

          Our opinion expressed above is limited to the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, the applicable provisions of the Delaware constitution
and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such laws, and we do not
express any opinion concerning any other laws. This opinion is given as of the
date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes that may
hereafter be brought to our attention.

          We hereby consent to the reference to our name under the heading
"Legal Matters" in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus forming a part of the
Registration Statement and to the use of this opinion for filing as Exhibit 5.1
to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit
that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under
Section 7 of the Act or the related rules and regulations thereunder.

                                            Very truly yours,

                                            /s/ Katten Muchin Zavis

                      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
eShare.com, Inc. (formerly eShare Technologies, Inc.):

     We have audited the balance sheet of eShare.com, Inc. (formerly eShare
Technologies, Inc.) as of December 31, 1998, and the related statements of
operations, redeemable preferred stock and stockholders' deficit and cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented separately herein). These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

     We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of eShare.com, Inc.
(formerly eShare Technologies, Inc.) as of December 31, 1998, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
