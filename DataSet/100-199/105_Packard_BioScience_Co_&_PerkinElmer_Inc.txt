PERKINELMER, INC. - AMENDMENT 1

s-4a

Page 56)

Each outstanding share of Packard BioScience common stock will
be converted into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock. Based on this exchange ratio of 0.311
and the number of shares of Packard BioScience common stock
outstanding on August 21, 2001, a total of approximately
[                    ]
 shares of PerkinElmer common stock will be issued in the merger.

PerkinElmer will not issue fractional shares of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, PerkinElmer
will pay cash, without interest, for any fractional shares.

Stock Options

(Page 56)

Pursuant to the merger agreement, PerkinElmer will assume all
outstanding options to purchase shares of Packard BioScience
common stock. Each option to purchase shares of Packard
BioScience common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will become an option to acquire,
on the same terms, 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common stock,
with the option exercise price to be adjusted accordingly. In
connection with the merger, all outstanding options to purchase
shares of Packard BioScience common stock will vest in full.



Conditions to the Merger

(Page 64)

The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction of a
number of mutual and nonmutual conditions, including:

• 

	Packard BioScience stockholders must have adopted the merger
	agreement and approved the merger;

• 

	PerkinElmer stockholders must have approved the issuance of
	PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger;

• 

	the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of PerkinElmer common
	stock that will be issued to Packard BioScience stockholders in
	the merger must have been approved;

• 

	the receipt of legal opinions regarding the treatment of the
	merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
	section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

• 

	the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint
	proxy statement/prospectus is a part, must have become effective
	and not be the subject of a stop order, and no proceedings
	seeking a stop order must have been threatened or initiated;

• 

	the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
	Improvements Act of 1976 must have expired or been terminated;
	and

• 

	other customary conditions specified in the merger agreement.

The party entitled to assert any condition to the merger may
waive the condition.

No Solicitation by Packard BioScience

(Page 60)

Packard BioScience has agreed that until termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms neither it nor any
of its subsidiaries or representatives will:

• 

	solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any proposal from a
	third party that might lead to an acquisition proposal for
	Packard BioScience, including approving any person becoming an
	interested stockholder under the business combination with
	interested stockholder provision of Delaware law; or

• 

	enter into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide
	any information to a third party with respect to, an acquisition
	proposal.

However, Packard BioScience may furnish information to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, a third party
relating to an acquisition proposal that the Packard BioScience
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, is reasonably
likely to result in a superior proposal.

In addition, the Packard BioScience board of directors has
agreed that neither it nor any of its committees will withdraw
or knowingly modify in any material adverse manner its
recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger, cause or
permit Packard BioScience to enter into any agreement relating
to an alternative acquisition proposal or adopt, approve or
recommend an alternative acquisition proposal. However, the
Packard BioScience board of directors may withdraw or knowingly
modify in any material adverse manner its or any
committee’s approval or recommendation if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors, that the third party’s acquisition
proposal is a superior proposal, and may adopt, approve or
recommend such superior proposal if:

• 

	Packard BioScience intends to enter into a binding written
	agreement to consummate the superior proposal;

• 

	Packard BioScience complies with the notice and other procedural
	requirements set forth in the merger agreement;



• 

	PerkinElmer does not, in the time allowed by the merger
	agreement, match the superior proposal; and

• 

	Packard BioScience pays to PerkinElmer a termination fee of
	$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement.

Packard BioScience is not prohibited from taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer or
from making other disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Packard BioScience board of directors,
based on advice from its outside legal counsel, failure to
disclose would be inconsistent with its legal obligations.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

(Page 66)

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience can mutually agree to
terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. In
addition, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience can each terminate
the merger agreement under the circumstances set forth in the
merger agreement and described below in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Termination Fees and Expenses

(Page 67)

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience, generally, will bear their
own expenses related to the merger. However, under specified
circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, PerkinElmer or
Packard BioScience may be required to reimburse the other up to
a maximum of $1,500,000 for expenses related to the merger.

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience are each obligated to pay the
other a termination fee of $23,500,000 if the merger agreement
is terminated under specified circumstances set forth in the
merger agreement and described below in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Opinion of PerkinElmer’s Financial Advisor

(Page 38)

In connection with the merger, Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
PerkinElmer’s financial advisor, rendered a written
opinion, dated July 13, 2001, to the PerkinElmer board of
directors that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to
the matters described in its opinion and such other matters it
considered relevant, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
PerkinElmer. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex B. 
PerkinElmer urges its stockholders to read the
opinion in its entirety.
 The opinion of Goldman Sachs is
directed to the PerkinElmer board of directors and relates only
to the fairness of the exchange ratio from a financial point of
view. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder with respect to any other matter relating to the
proposed merger.

Opinion of Packard BioScience’s Financial Advisor

(Page 42)

In connection with the merger, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Packard BioScience’s financial advisor, rendered a written
opinion, dated July 13, 2001, to the Packard BioScience
board of directors that, as of the date of its opinion and based
upon and subject to the matters stated therein, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the stockholders of Packard BioScience. The full text of the
written opinion of JPMorgan is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex C. 
Packard BioScience
encourages its stockholders to read the opinion carefully in its
entirety to understand the procedures followed, the assumptions
made, the matters considered and the limitations on the review
undertaken by JPMorgan in providing its opinion.

JPMorgan’s opinion is addressed to the Packard
BioScience board of directors and relates only to the fairness
of the exchange ratio from a financial point



of view to the stockholders of Packard BioScience. The opinion
does not address any other aspect of the proposed merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
how to vote on the proposed merger or any other matters relating
to the proposed merger.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

(Page 49)

In considering the recommendation of the Packard BioScience
board of directors, Packard BioScience stockholders should be
aware of the interests that Packard BioScience executive
officers and directors have in the merger. These include:

• 

	severance benefits to certain executive officers of Packard
	BioScience that may be paid under pre-existing employment
	agreements;

• 

	an employment agreement between PerkinElmer and Franklin R.
	Witney, Packard BioScience’s President, that will become
	effective upon consummation of the merger;

• 

	accelerated vesting upon consummation of the merger of all
	options and certain shares of restricted stock held by Packard
	BioScience employees, executive officers and directors;

• 

	the fact that, as of August 21, 2001, the executive
	officers and directors of Packard BioScience held
	          shares
	 of Packard BioScience common stock;

• 

	Packard BioScience’s implementation of a retention bonus
	program in connection with the merger; and

• 

	customary rights to indemnification of directors and executive
	officers of Packard BioScience against specified liabilities.

In addition, Packard BioScience stockholders should be aware
that Packard BioScience’s largest stockholder, Stonington
Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., which, as of July 13,
2001 holds 30,898,890 shares, or approximately 45% of Packard
BioScience’s outstanding shares, entered into a
stockholder’s agreement with PerkinElmer in connection with
the merger. Four members of the Packard BioScience board of
directors are designees of Stonington. Under the
stockholder’s agreement, Stonington is entitled to
registration rights with respect to the PerkinElmer shares it
receives in the merger and to nominate one director to the
PerkinElmer board of directors.

In considering the fairness of the merger to Packard BioScience
stockholders, the Packard BioScience board of directors took
into account these interests. Some of these interests are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Packard
BioScience stockholders generally in the merger.

Accounting Treatment

(Page 53)

In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger, as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmer’s financial statements prospectively as of the
completion of the merger.



Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

(Page 53)

We have structured the merger in order to qualify as a
reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. It is our
intention that no gain or loss will generally be recognized by
Packard BioScience stockholders for federal income tax purposes
on the exchange of shares of Packard BioScience common stock
solely for shares of PerkinElmer common stock. Packard
BioScience stockholders, however, will recognize gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes to the extent any cash received
in lieu of fractional shares is greater than or less than,
respectively, the tax basis allocable to the fractional shares.

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of
the merger to the Packard BioScience stockholders will depend on
the facts of each Packard BioScience stockholder’s own
situation. Each Packard BioScience stockholder should consult
his, her or its tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax
consequences of the merger.

PerkinElmer stockholders will have no tax consequences as a
result of the merger.

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience Stockholders Have No
Appraisal Rights

(Page 55)

Under applicable law, neither PerkinElmer stockholders nor
Packard BioScience stockholders have appraisal rights with
respect to the merger.

How the Rights of Packard BioScience Stockholders Will Differ
as PerkinElmer Stockholders

(Page 81)

The rights of Packard BioScience stockholders as stockholders of
PerkinElmer, a Massachusetts corporation, after the merger will
be governed by Massachusetts law and PerkinElmer’s
corporate charter and by-laws. Those rights differ from the
rights of Packard BioScience stockholders under Delaware law and
Packard BioScience’s corporate charter and by-laws.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors before
you decide whether to vote to approve the proposals submitted to
you. You should also consider the other information in this
document.

Risks Relating to the Merger

PerkinElmer’s stock price is volatile and the value
of the PerkinElmer common stock issued in the merger will depend
on its market price at the time of the merger. No adjustment to
the exchange ratio will be made as a result of changes in the
market price of PerkinElmer’s common stock.

The market price of PerkinElmer common stock, like that of the
shares of Packard BioScience and many other high technology
companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. For
example, from July 3, 2000 to July 13, 2001,
PerkinElmer common stock traded as high as $60.50 per share and
as low as $21.50 per share.

At the closing of the merger, each share of Packard BioScience
common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.311
of a share of PerkinElmer common stock. This exchange ratio will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of PerkinElmer
common stock or of Packard BioScience common stock. In addition,
neither PerkinElmer nor Packard BioScience may unilaterally
terminate or renegotiate the merger agreement, and Packard
BioScience may not resolicit the vote of its stockholders,
solely because of changes in the market price of PerkinElmer
common stock or of Packard BioScience common stock. Any
reduction in PerkinElmer’s common stock price will result
in Packard BioScience stockholders receiving less value in the
merger at closing. Packard BioScience stockholders will not know
the exact value of PerkinElmer common stock to be issued to them
in the merger at the time of the special meeting of Packard
BioScience stockholders.

PerkinElmer may face challenges in integrating PerkinElmer
and Packard BioScience and, as a result, may not realize the
expected benefits of the proposed merger.

Integrating the operations and personnel of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience will be a complex process. PerkinElmer cannot
be certain that the integration will be completed rapidly or
will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The
successful integration of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience
will require, among other things, integration of sales and
marketing groups and coordination of development efforts. The
diversion of the attention of PerkinElmer’s management and
any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the
companies could cause the disruption of, or a loss of momentum
in, the activities of the combined company’s business.
Further, the process of combining PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience could negatively affect employee morale and the
ability of the combined company to retain some of its key
employees after the merger. In addition, the announcement and
completion of the merger could cause customers to delay or
change orders for products as a result of uncertainty over the
integration of products. The inability to successfully integrate
the operations and personnel of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience, or any significant delay in achieving integration,
could have a material adverse effect on the combined company
after the merger.

If PerkinElmer does not successfully integrate Packard
BioScience or the merger’s benefits do not meet the
expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market price
of PerkinElmer common stock may decline.

The market price of PerkinElmer common stock may decline as a
result of the merger if:

• 

	the integration of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience is
	unsuccessful;

• 

	PerkinElmer does not achieve the perceived financial and other
	benefits of the merger as rapidly as, or to the extent,
	anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or

• 

	the effect of the merger on PerkinElmer’s financial results
	is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry
	analysts.



Failure to complete the merger may result in PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience paying a termination fee to the other.
Such a failure could also result in a decrease in the market
price of PerkinElmer common stock or Packard BioScience common
stock and cause each company to nevertheless incur legal and
accounting fees.

If the merger is not completed for any reason, PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience may be subject to a number of material risks,
including:

• 

	PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience may require the other to pay a
	termination fee of $23,500,000 or up to $1,500,000 as
	reimbursement for expenses under the circumstances described in
	the merger agreement;

• 

	the market price of PerkinElmer common stock or Packard
	BioScience common stock may decline to the extent that the
	current market price reflects a market assumption that the
	merger will be completed; and

• 

	PerkinElmer’s and Packard BioScience’s costs incurred
	related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must
	be paid even if the merger is not completed.

If the merger agreement is terminated and the Packard BioScience
board of directors seeks another merger or business combination,
Packard BioScience stockholders cannot be certain that Packard
BioScience will be able to find a partner willing to pay an
equivalent or more attractive price than the price PerkinElmer
has agreed to pay in the merger.

Some of the officers and directors of Packard BioScience
have conflicts of interest that may have influenced them to
support or approve the merger.

Packard BioScience’s officers and directors may have been
influenced to approve the merger because of arrangements that
provide them with interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of Packard BioScience
stockholders in the merger, which are described under the
section entitled “The Merger — Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger.”

The Packard BioScience board of directors was aware of and took
into account these arrangements when it approved the merger. It
is possible that these arrangements may have influenced these
directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

The merger may cause Packard BioScience to lose key
personnel which could materially affect Packard
BioScience’s business and require Packard BioScience to
incur substantial costs to recruit replacements for lost
personnel.

As a result of Packard BioScience’s change in ownership,
current and prospective Packard BioScience employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles within
PerkinElmer. This uncertainty may adversely affect Packard
BioScience’s ability to attract and retain key management,
sales, marketing and technical personnel. Any failure to attract
and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on
the combined business of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer.

Customers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience may
terminate their relationship with PerkinElmer or Packard
BioScience as a result of concerns over products and services to
be provided following the merger.

The announcement and closing of the merger could cause customers
and potential customers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience to
cancel orders or to fail to place new orders. In particular,
customers could be concerned about future products and services
or customer service during the period of integration of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer. The loss of customers or the failure
to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on
the future revenues and competitive position of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience.



Risks Relating to PerkinElmer’s Business

PerkinElmer’s operating results could be harmed if
the industries into which it sells its products are in downward
cycles.

Some of the industries and markets into which PerkinElmer sells
its products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are
characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing
capacity and erosion of average selling prices. Any significant
downturn in PerkinElmer’s customers’ markets or in
general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction
in demand for PerkinElmer’s products and could harm its
business. For example, in the fiscal quarter ended July 1,
2001, the operating results of PerkinElmer’s
Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments were adversely
affected by the downturn in the photography and semiconductor
markets.

If PerkinElmer does not introduce new products in a timely
manner, its products could become obsolete, and its operating
results would suffer.

PerkinElmer sells many of its products in industries
characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, PerkinElmer’s products could become
technologically obsolete over time, in which case
PerkinElmer’s revenue and operating results would suffer.
The success of PerkinElmer’s new product offerings will
depend upon several factors, including its ability to:

• 

	accurately anticipate customer needs;

• 

	innovate and develop new technologies and applications;

• 

	successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;

• 

	price its products competitively and manufacture and deliver its
	products in sufficient volumes and on time; and

• 

	differentiate its offerings from its competitors’ offerings.

Many of PerkinElmer’s products are used by its customers to
develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore,
PerkinElmer must anticipate industry trends and develop products
in advance of the commercialization of its customers’
products. In developing any new product, PerkinElmer may be
required to make a substantial investment before it can
determine the commercial viability of the new product. If
PerkinElmer fails to accurately foresee its customers’
needs and future activities, PerkinElmer may invest heavily in
research and development of products that do not lead to
significant revenue.

Economic, political and other risks associated with
international sales and operations could adversely affect
PerkinElmer’s sales.

Since PerkinElmer sells its products worldwide, its businesses
are subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. PerkinElmer’s revenue originating outside
the United States represented 53% of its total revenues from
continuing operations in the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000. PerkinElmer anticipates that revenue from international
operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of
its total revenue. In addition, many of PerkinElmer’s
manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located
outside the United States. Accordingly, PerkinElmer’s
future results could be harmed by a variety of factors,
including:

• 

	changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

• 

	changes in a country’s or region’s political or
	economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging
	markets;

• 

	longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of
	collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

• 

	trade protection measures and import or export licensing
	requirements;



• 

	differing tax laws and changes in those laws;

• 

	difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

• 

	differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

• 

	differing protection of intellectual property and changes in
	that protection; and

• 

	differing regulatory requirements and changes in those
	requirements.

Fluctuations in PerkinElmer’s quarterly operating
results may cause its stock price to decline.

Given the nature of the markets in which PerkinElmer
participates, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and
profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic
conditions may cause PerkinElmer to adjust its operations. A
high proportion of PerkinElmer’s costs are fixed, due in
part to its significant sales, research and development and
manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could
disproportionately affect PerkinElmer’s operating results
in a quarter. Factors that may affect PerkinElmer’s
quarterly operating results and the market price of
PerkinElmer’s common stock include:

• 

	demand for and market acceptance of PerkinElmer’s products;

• 

	competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;

• 

	adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in
	which PerkinElmer does business;

• 

	adverse changes in industries, such as drug discovery,
	pharmaceutical research, telecommunications, semiconductors and
	electronics, on which PerkinElmer is particularly dependent;

• 

	changes in the portions of PerkinElmer’s revenue
	represented by its various products and customers;

• 

	delays or problems in the introduction of new products;

• 

	PerkinElmer’s competitors’ announcement or
	introduction of new products, services or technological
	innovations;

• 

	increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and

• 

	changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. This volatility has significantly affected
the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated
to or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
the market price of PerkinElmer’s common stock.

PerkinElmer may not be able to successfully implement its
acquisition strategy and integrate acquired businesses,
including Packard BioScience, into its existing business or make
acquired businesses profitable.

One of PerkinElmer’s strategies is to supplement its
internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that
complement or augment its existing product lines. PerkinElmer
may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for
many reasons, including:

• 

	competition among buyers;

• 

	the need for regulatory and other approvals; and

• 

	the high valuations of businesses.

Some of the businesses PerkinElmer may seek to acquire may be
marginally profitable or unprofitable. In addition, the earnings
or losses of acquired businesses may dilute PerkinElmer’s
earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable
levels of profitability, PerkinElmer must improve their
management, operations, products and market penetration.
PerkinElmer may not be successful in this regard and may
encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses
into its existing operations.



To finance PerkinElmer’s acquisitions, PerkinElmer may have
to raise additional funds, either through public or private
financings. PerkinElmer may be unable to obtain such funds or
may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.

PerkinElmer faces aggressive competition in many areas of
its business; if PerkinElmer does not compete effectively, its
business will be harmed.

PerkinElmer encounters aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of its business. PerkinElmer may not
be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To
remain competitive, PerkinElmer must develop new products and
periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner.
PerkinElmer anticipates that it may have to adjust prices of
many of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new
competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be
threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the
value of these product lines.

If PerkinElmer fails to maintain satisfactory compliance
with the Food and Drug Administration’s regulations and
those of other governmental agencies, PerkinElmer may be forced
to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution,
and it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by PerkinElmer’s Life
Sciences segment are subject to regulation by the United States
Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities,
from design and development to labeling, manufacturing,
promotion, sales and distribution. If PerkinElmer fails to
comply with the FDA’s regulations or those of similar
international agencies, PerkinElmer may have to recall products
and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition,
PerkinElmer could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for
PerkinElmer’s products or increase PerkinElmer’s
expenses.

PerkinElmer competes in markets in which it or its customers
must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations,
such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug
regulations. PerkinElmer develops, configures and markets its
products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.
Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand
for PerkinElmer’s products or the cost of producing these
products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for
PerkinElmer’s proprietary products, processes and
technologies may be difficult and expensive; PerkinElmer may
infringe intellectual property rights of third parties.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to PerkinElmer
because developing and marketing new technologies and products
is time-consuming and expensive. PerkinElmer owns many U.S. and
foreign patents and intends to apply for additional patents to
cover its products. PerkinElmer may not obtain issued patents
from any pending or future patent applications owned by or
licensed to PerkinElmer. The claims allowed under any issued
patents may not be broad enough to protect PerkinElmer’s
technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent
issued patents owned by or licensed to PerkinElmer or claim that
PerkinElmer’s products and operations infringe their patent
or other intellectual property rights. PerkinElmer may incur
significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect its
proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third
parties. In addition, claims of third parties against
PerkinElmer could result in awards of substantial damages or
court orders that could effectively prevent PerkinElmer from
making, using or selling its products in the U.S. or abroad.

PerkinElmer has substantial existing debt and may incur
additional debt in the future.

As of July 1, 2001, PerkinElmer had $589.8 million in
outstanding long-term debt. In addition, upon completion of the
merger, PerkinElmer’s consolidated debt will include
Packard BioScience’s indebtedness, including Packard
BioScience’s obligations under its senior subordinated
notes. As of June 30, 2001, the



amount outstanding under Packard BioScience’s senior
subordinated notes was $118.2 million. PerkinElmer’s
substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that
PerkinElmer may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the
principal of, interest on and other amounts due in respect of
PerkinElmer’s indebtedness when due. PerkinElmer may also
obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of
credit and issue additional commercial paper to meet future
financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing
PerkinElmer’s total leverage.

PerkinElmer’s substantial leverage could have significant
negative consequences, including:

• 

	increasing PerkinElmer’s vulnerability to general adverse
	economic and industry conditions;

• 

	limiting PerkinElmer’s ability to obtain additional
	financing;

• 

	requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of
	PerkinElmer’s cash flow from operations to service its
	indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of its cash flow
	available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;

• 

	limiting PerkinElmer’s flexibility in planning for, or
	reacting to, changes in its business and the industries in which
	PerkinElmer competes; and

• 

	placing PerkinElmer at a possible competitive disadvantage with
	less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better
	access to capital resources.

A significant portion of PerkinElmer’s outstanding
indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result,
PerkinElmer’s interest payment obligations on such
indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase.

Risks Relating to Packard BioScience’s Business

As competition in the markets Packard BioScience targets
intensifies, Packard BioScience may not be able to compete
effectively in these markets.

The life sciences research tools industry is highly competitive,
and Packard BioScience encounters competition from a large
number of manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets.
Some of Packard BioScience’s competitors compete with
Packard BioScience in only one of its product lines. Others
compete with Packard BioScience in a number of its product
lines. In addition, Packard BioScience has various competitors
that are focusing on the areas that are being addressed by
Packard BioScience’s integrated platforms.

Some of Packard BioScience’s competitors, such as Applera
Corp. (formerly PE Biosystems), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and
Beckman Coulter, Inc., are significantly larger and have greater
resources than Packard BioScience does. These competitors could
at any time decide to use a more substantial amount of their
resources in the markets in which Packard BioScience competes
and, as a result, compete more broadly and more directly with
Packard BioScience.

Companies that, like Packard BioScience, design, manufacture and
market analytical instruments for use in the life sciences
research industry, face competition in these areas from genomic,
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics companies, and
also from academic and research institutions and government or
other publicly-funded agencies, both in the United States and
abroad. Packard BioScience may not be able to compete
effectively with all of these competitors.

Packard BioScience’s success will depend partly on
its ability to successfully introduce new products and platforms
and expand the range of applications for its current
products.

In a market primarily driven by the need for innovative
products, Packard BioScience’s revenues growth will depend
on overcoming various technological challenges to successfully
introduce new products and platforms into the marketplace in a
timely manner. Packard BioScience’s new technology
platforms require state-of-the-art or even pioneering know-how
in the areas of biochemistry, fluidics and physics. In addition,
Packard BioScience must continue to develop new applications for
its existing products, such as



integrated platforms. Market acceptance of these new products
and platforms will depend on many factors, including
demonstrating to existing and potential customers that Packard
BioScience’s technologies are superior to other
technologies and products that are available now or may become
available in the future.

If Packard BioScience is not able to overcome these
technological challenges, or even if it experiences difficulties
or delays, Packard BioScience may lose its current customers and
may not be able to attract new customers, which could seriously
harm its business and future growth prospects. In addition, some
of Packard BioScience’s licensed technology is subject to
contractual restrictions, which may limit its ability to develop
or commercialize products for some applications. For example,
many of Packard BioScience’s license agreements are limited
to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical
diagnostics applications. Packard BioScience also may be unable
to obtain licenses to new or existing technologies needed to
introduce new products.

If Packard BioScience is unable to protect its
intellectual property effectively, it may be unable to prevent
third parties from using its technology, which could impair its
ability to compete effectively in the market.

Packard BioScience’s success will depend in part on its
ability, and the ability of its business partners and licensors,
to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for the
technology underlying its products, both in the United States
and in other countries. There can be no assurance that any of
the presently pending or future patent applications will result
in issued patents, or that any patents issued to Packard
BioScience or licensed by Packard BioScience will not be
challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable. Further, Packard
BioScience cannot guarantee that any patents issued to it will
provide a basis for commercially viable products or provide it
with a significant competitive advantage.

In addition to its patents, Packard BioScience possesses a wide
array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and
licenses intellectual property rights to and from third parties.
Such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology
underlying Packard BioScience’s products. Moreover, some of
Packard BioScience’s licenses can be terminated or
converted to non-exclusive by the licensor if Packard BioScience
fails to meet specified performance targets.

If Packard BioScience fails to successfully enforce its
proprietary technology or otherwise maintain the proprietary
nature of its intellectual property with respect to its
significant current or proposed products, Packard
BioScience’s competitive position and, as a result, its
sales could suffer.

Notwithstanding Packard BioScience’s efforts to protect its
intellectual property, its competitors may independently develop
similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal
or superior to Packard BioScience’s technology and products
without infringing on any of Packard BioScience’s
intellectual property rights or design around its proprietary
technologies. If customers prefer these alternative
technologies, Packard BioScience’s sales could be adversely
affected.

Packard BioScience’s products could infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others, causing costly
litigation and seriously harming Packard BioScience’s
business.

Due to the very significant number of U.S. and foreign patents
issued to, and other intellectual property rights owned by,
entities operating in the industry in which Packard BioScience
operates, Packard BioScience believes that there is a
significant risk of litigation arising from infringement of
these patents and other rights. Third parties may assert
infringement or other intellectual property claims against
Packard BioScience or its business partners or licensors.
Packard BioScience may have to pay substantial damages,
including treble damages, for past infringement if it is
ultimately determined that its products infringe a third
party’s proprietary rights. In addition, even if such
claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in
substantial expense and divert the efforts of technical and
management personnel.

Packard BioScience also may be subject to significant damages or
injunctions against development and sale of some of its
products, which could have a material adverse effect on its
future revenues. Furthermore, claims of intellectual property
infringement may require Packard BioScience to enter into



royalty or license agreements with third parties, and Packard
BioScience may not be able to obtain royalty or license
agreements on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.

A decline in the use of radioisotopic processes and
instruments could have a material adverse effect on its
revenues.

Packard BioScience’s traditional or “legacy”
product lines, which are used in connection with radioisotopic
methods, have historically been a significant portion of Packard
BioScience’s total revenues, and in the year ended December
31, 2000, they continued to account for approximately 28% of
Packard BioScience’s total instrument and related
consumables revenues. Because of their radioactivity, isotopic
labels are environmentally unfriendly and difficult and
potentially harmful to handle. Their by-products create waste
disposal problems for Packard BioScience’s customers that
are becoming increasingly more expensive. Packard BioScience
believes that the trend in the life sciences research industry
is toward the use of competing nonisotopic instrumentation.
Accordingly, Packard BioScience has shifted its focus to
nonisotopic methodologies, including fluorescent and
chemiluminescent instruments. However, you should be aware that
a decline in traditional radioisotopic methods may have a
material adverse impact on Packard BioScience’s revenues
and operating profit.

Because a substantial portion of Packard BioScience’s
assets is represented by intangibles, such as goodwill
associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing
patent rights and technology licenses, the failure to realize
the full value of those assets could adversely affect Packard
BioScience’s results of operations.

As of December 31, 2000, Packard BioScience’s total
assets included $119.7 million of net intangible assets,
representing approximately 39% of its total assets and
approximately 144% of its total stockholders’ equity. Net
intangible assets consist of goodwill associated with
acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights
and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These
assets have historically been amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. In connection with recently
issued SFAS No. 142, Packard BioScience will cease to
amortize its goodwill and other intangibles assets as of
January 1, 2002. Packard BioScience periodically evaluates
whether events or circumstances have occurred that would
indicate that the carrying values of those assets may no longer
be recoverable and any resulting write-down is recognized as a
charge to its earnings. There can be no assurance that Packard
BioScience will ultimately be able to realize the full value
assigned to those assets. Any realization assessment that
results in the write-off of a significant portion of Packard
BioScience’s net intangible assets could adversely affect
its results of operations.

Because purchases of Packard BioScience’s products
are significantly affected by capital spending policies of its
customers and government funding, any decrease in customer
capital spending or government funding could adversely affect
Packard BioScience’s sales and growth prospects.

The capital spending policies of Packard BioScience’s
primary customers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
agrochemical companies and clinical diagnostics laboratories,
have a significant effect on the demand for its products and
platforms. Those policies are based on a wide variety of
factors, including resources available to make these purchases,
spending priorities among various types of equipment and
policies regarding capital expenditures during industry
downturns or recessionary periods. These companies represented
in total approximately 45% of Packard BioScience’s revenues
in the year ended December 31, 2000. Any decrease in
capital spending by customers resulting from any of these
factors could adversely affect Packard BioScience’s sales
and growth prospects.

Similarly, many of Packard BioScience’s customers,
including universities, government research laboratories,
private foundations and other institutions, obtain funding for
the purchase of Packard BioScience’s products from grants
by governments or government agencies. If government funding
necessary to purchase Packard BioScience’s products were to
decrease, sales could be adversely affected.



Packard BioScience’s revenues and operating results
could be adversely impacted if risks associated with
international sales and operations materialize.

Since Packard BioScience sells its products worldwide, its
business is subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. Packard BioScience’s revenues originating
outside the United States represented 45% of its total revenues
in the year ended December 31, 2000. Packard BioScience
anticipates that revenues from international operations will
continue to represent a substantial portion of its total
revenues. In addition, a number of Packard BioScience’s
manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the
United States. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar
increases relative to the value of currencies Packard BioScience
uses to do business in foreign countries, its revenues and
operating results, which are stated in U.S. dollars, could be
adversely affected. In addition, because most of Packard
BioScience’s products are manufactured in the United States
for export to foreign countries, trade protection measures and
import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive
actions by foreign governments could have an adverse effect on
its revenues and operating results.

The current technology labor market is very competitive,
and Packard BioScience’s business may suffer if it is not
able to hire and retain sufficient personnel.

Packard BioScience’s future success depends on the
continued service of its key technical, sales, marketing,
manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. The loss
of the services of any of these individuals could have a
material adverse effect on Packard BioScience’s product
development and commercialization efforts. In addition,
research, product development and commercialization will require
additional skilled personnel. Competition for qualified
personnel in the technology area is intense, and Packard
BioScience operates in several geographic locations where labor
markets are particularly competitive, including New Haven,
Connecticut, Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts and Los
Angeles, California, where key product development laboratories
are located. If Packard BioScience is unable to attract and
retain a sufficient number of qualified employees on acceptable
terms, its business, financial condition and results of
operations could be seriously harmed. The inability to retain
and hire qualified personnel could also hinder the future
expansion of Packard BioScience’s business.

SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following selected historical consolidated financial
information of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience has been
derived from their respective historical consolidated financial
statements including their notes, and should be read in
conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and
notes. The historical consolidated financial statements of
PerkinElmer as of January 2, 2000 and December 31, 2000 and
for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000
as reclassified for the planned sale of its Security and
Detection Systems business in its Current Report on
Form 8-K filed on August 3, 2001 and the historical
consolidated financial statements of Packard BioScience as of
December 31, 1999 and 2000 and for the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000 were audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, and are
incorporated in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by
reference. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The PerkinElmer historical financial information as of and for
the interim periods presented below has been prepared on the
same basis as the information derived from historical
consolidated financial statements prepared on an annual basis.
In the opinion of management of PerkinElmer, this historical
information includes all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations of PerkinElmer as
of these dates and for these periods. The results of the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for future periods.

The Packard BioScience historical financial information as of
and for the interim periods presented below has been prepared on
the same basis as the information derived from historical
financial statements prepared on an annual basis. In the opinion
of management of Packard BioScience, this historical information
includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and results of operations of Packard BioScience as of
these dates and for these periods. The results of the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for future periods.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of NEN Life Sciences, Inc. and GSI
Lumonics, Inc., referred to as GSLI, as purchases and properly
reflects the appropriate accounting methods for all intangible
assets under the accounting rules that were in existence prior
to June 30, 2001.

Effective June 30, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,
Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Those statements require the use of the
purchase method of accounting and the allocation of the purchase
price to assets and liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values. They define the criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and
eliminate the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 are
effective for any business combination that is initiated after
June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro
forma combined statements of operations do not reflect any
amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite
lives that will result from PerkinElmer’s proposed
acquisition of Packard BioScience.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of Packard BioScience and NEN as of
the beginning of the periods presented and should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and related
notes thereto for PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and NEN. The
financial statements required to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the NEN acquisition were included as
exhibits in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by
PerkinElmer on August 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
financial information for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 and the six-month period ended July 1, 2001 give
effect to the acquisitions as if they were completed as of
January 3, 2000, and combine PerkinElmer, Packard
BioScience and NEN’s historical statements of operations
for each respective period as necessary. The unaudited pro forma
combined results for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 exclude, due to its non-recurring nature, an
acquisition-related charge of



$24.3 million for acquired in-process research and development
related to NEN. Additionally, the pro forma financial
information exclude, due to its non-recurring nature, an
estimated acquisition-related charge of $66.8 million for
acquired in-process research and development related to the
proposed acquisition of Packard BioScience. PerkinElmer has not
yet finalized its appraisal of this in-process research and
development charge and accordingly, the final amount of the
excluded charge may differ from this estimate. The unaudited pro
forma combined balance sheet as of July 1, 2001 includes
the historical balance sheet of PerkinElmer as of July 1,
2001 and Packard BioScience as of June 30, 2001 and gives
effect to the proposed acquisition of Packard BioScience as if
it occurred on July 1, 2001.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is
provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of PerkinElmer’s operating results that would
have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on the
dates, or at the beginning of the periods, for which the
consummation of the acquisitions is being given effect, nor is
it necessarily indicative of PerkinElmer’s future operating
results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments do not reflect any
operating efficiencies and cost savings that PerkinElmer
believes are achievable.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been
prepared using the purchase method of accounting, whereby the
total cost of the acquisitions has been allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values at the effective date of
each acquisition. For the Packard BioScience acquisition, such
allocations will be based on studies and independent valuations,
which are currently being conducted. Accordingly, the
allocations reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information are preliminary and subject to revision.

You should review the detailed unaudited pro forma combined
financial information under the section entitled “Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” for further
discussion of these matters, including footnotes.

Dividends

During fiscal 2000, PerkinElmer’s board of directors
declared four regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per
share, resulting in an annual rate of $0.28 per share, after
giving retroactive effect to the two-for-one stock split of
PerkinElmer common stock effected on June 1, 2001. During
the first and second quarters of fiscal 2001, PerkinElmer’s
board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07
per share.

Since Packard BioScience became a public company on
April 19, 2000, it has not declared or paid cash dividends
and does not intend to pay any cash dividends on its capital
stock in the foreseeable future. If the merger does not occur,
Packard BioScience currently intends to retain earnings. Packard
BioScience’s future dividend policy will depend on its
earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and the
requirements of the financing agreements to which it may be a
party, and on other factors considered relevant by its board of
directors. In addition, covenants in Packard BioScience’s
senior credit facility and the indenture governing its senior
subordinated notes limit its ability to declare and pay cash
dividends on its common stock.

275 Research Parkway, Meriden, Connecticut.

What Will Be Voted Upon

At the special meeting, stockholders of Packard BioScience will
be asked to adopt and approve the merger agreement and merger
with PerkinElmer, under which a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PerkinElmer will be merged with and into Packard BioScience and
each outstanding share of Packard BioScience will be converted
into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of common stock of
PerkinElmer, and to transact any other business that may be
properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournments,
postponements or continuations of that meeting.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

Only stockholders of record of Packard BioScience at the close
of business on the August 21, 2001 record date for the
special meeting are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting. Each Packard BioScience stockholder is entitled
to one vote for each share held as of the close of business on
the record date. At the close of business on the record date,
there were
[               ]
 shares of Packard BioScience common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, held by
[               ]

Vote Required to Adopt the Merger Agreement

Under Delaware law, holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Packard BioScience common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting must vote in favor of adopting the merger
agreement. Stonington Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P.,
Packard BioScience’s largest stockholder, has agreed to
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and to
direct other shares over which it asserts voting control to vote
to adopt the merger agreement, as long as the Packard BioScience
board of directors does not withdraw or knowingly modify in a
material adverse manner its recommendation of the merger in
response to a superior proposal in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations of, the merger agreement. Emery G. Olcott,
Packard BioScience’s chairman and chief executive officer,
Franklin R. Witney, Packard BioScience’s president and
chief operating officer, Timothy O. White, Jr., Packard
BioScience’s vice president, general counsel and secretary,
and Richard T. McKernan, a former senior vice president and
director of Packard BioScience, together with certain members of
their families, have also agreed to vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, as long as the Packard
BioScience board of directors does not withdraw or knowingly
modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation of the
merger in response to a superior proposal in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations of, the merger agreement.
Collectively, these stockholders have agreed, with respect to a
total of 34,391,455 shares of Packard BioScience common stock or
     % of the outstanding shares of
Packard BioScience common stock on August 21, 2001, the
record date for the special meeting of Packard BioScience
stockholders, to vote in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement, subject to the above conditions. Packard
BioScience’s directors, executive officers and their
affiliates are entitled to vote      %
of the outstanding shares of Packard BioScience common stock as
of the record date.



Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. Abstentions are counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists.

If you hold your shares of Packard BioScience common stock
through a broker, bank or other nominee, generally the nominee
may only vote your Packard BioScience common stock in accordance
with your instructions. However, if your broker, bank or other
nominee has not timely received your instructions, it may vote
on matters for which it has discretionary voting authority.
Brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to vote on
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If a nominee cannot
vote on a matter because it does not have discretionary voting
authority, this is a “broker non-vote” on that matter.
Broker non-votes are counted as shares present or represented at
the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists.

For purposes of the vote with respect to the merger agreement
required under Delaware law, a failure to vote, a vote to
abstain and a broker non-vote will each have the same legal
effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

The Packard BioScience proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is solicited on behalf of the Packard
BioScience board of directors. Packard BioScience stockholders
are requested to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy
and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise
mail it to Packard BioScience. If your shares of Packard
BioScience common stock are registered in street name, your
broker may offer telephone and Internet voting options. You

other nominee to see which options are available. Please see the
accompanying proxy for more information.

All properly executed proxies received by Packard BioScience
prior to the special meeting that are not revoked will be voted
at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxies, or, if no direction is indicated, will
be voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. Packard BioScience’s board of
directors does not presently intend to bring any other business
before the special meeting. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the board knows of no other matters to be
brought before the special meeting. As to any other business
that may properly come before the special meeting, the persons
named as proxies in the accompanying Packard BioScience proxy
will vote those proxies in accordance with their judgment. A
Packard BioScience stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke
it at any time before it is exercised at the special meeting by:

• 

	delivering to the secretary of Packard BioScience a written
	notice, bearing a date later than the date of proxy, stating
	that the proxy is revoked;

• 

	signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
	bearing a later date than the date of the previous proxy prior
	to the vote at the special meeting; or

• 

	attending the special meeting and voting in person.

However, if you as a Packard BioScience stockholder elect to
vote in person at the special meeting and your shares are held
by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring to the
special meeting a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee authorizing you to vote the shares.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer will share the costs, other
than fees of accountants and attorneys, of preparing and mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and Packard BioScience

its stockholders. Following the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Packard BioScience and its agents may
solicit proxies by mail, telephone or in person. In addition,
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries
will send beneficial



owners the proxy materials. Packard BioScience will, upon
request, reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for
their reasonable expenses. Packard BioScience urges its
stockholders to vote proxies without delay.

Board Recommendation

Packard BioScience’s board of directors has voted
unanimously to adopt the merger agreement and believes that the
merger is fair and in the best interests of Packard BioScience
and its stockholders. Therefore, Packard BioScience’s board
of directors recommends that Packard BioScience stockholders
vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the merger.

The proposed merger is of great importance to the stockholders
of Packard BioScience. Accordingly, Packard BioScience
stockholders are urged to read and carefully consider the
information presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
and to complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed
proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.



THE PERKINELMER SPECIAL MEETING

PerkinElmer is furnishing this document to holders of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the PerkinElmer board of directors for use at the
special meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders to be held on
Wednesday, September 26, 2001, and any adjournment,
postponement or continuation of the meeting.

This document is first being furnished to PerkinElmer
stockholders on or about August 27, 2001.

Date, Time and Place of Meeting

The special meeting will be held on Wednesday,
September 26, 2001, at 10:30 a.m., local time, at Sheraton
Needham Hotel, 100 Cabot Street, Needham, Massachusetts
02494-2802.

What Will Be Voted Upon

At the special meeting, stockholders of PerkinElmer will be
asked to approve the issuance of 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer
common stock for each outstanding share of Packard BioScience
common stock in connection with the merger and to transact any
other business that may be properly brought before the special
meeting or any adjournments, postponements or continuations of
that meeting.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

Only stockholders of record of PerkinElmer common stock at the
close of business on the August 21, 2001 record date for
the special meeting are entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting. Each PerkinElmer stockholder is entitled to
one vote for each share of PerkinElmer common stock held as of
the close of business on the record date.

Vote Required to Approve the Issuance

PerkinElmer stockholder approval of the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger is required under the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, on which
PerkinElmer’s common stock is listed, because the number of
shares of PerkinElmer common stock issued in the merger will
exceed 20% of the number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the merger. The affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock present or represented by proxy and
voting on the proposal is required to approve the issuance of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger. As of
the close of business on the record date, there were
[          ]
shares of PerkinElmer common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote, held by
[          ]
holders of record. PerkinElmer’s directors, executive
officers and their affiliates are entitled to vote
     % of the outstanding shares of
PerkinElmer common stock as of August 21, 2001, the record
date of the special meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders.

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

If you hold your shares of PerkinElmer common stock through a
broker, bank or other nominee, generally the nominee may only
vote your PerkinElmer common stock in accordance with your
instructions. However, if it has not timely received your
instructions, the nominee may vote on matters for which it has
discretionary voting authority. Brokers will not have
discretionary voting authority to vote on the proposal to issue
the PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger. As a
result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner
of shares held in street name, brokers are not empowered to vote
these shares to approve the proposed issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger.

Since the required vote to approve the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger is based on the
number of shares present or represented by proxy at the special
meeting, rather than outstanding shares, abstentions and broker
non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal
assuming a quorum is present.



Voting and Revocation of Proxies

The PerkinElmer proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is solicited on behalf of the PerkinElmer
board of directors. PerkinElmer stockholders are requested to
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly
return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise mail it to
PerkinElmer. If your shares of PerkinElmer common stock are
registered in street name, your broker may offer telephone and
Internet voting options. You should check the information
forwarded by your broker, bank or other nominee to see which
options are available. Please see the accompanying proxy for
more information.

All properly executed proxies received by PerkinElmer prior to
the special meeting that are not revoked will be voted at the
special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on
the proxies, or, if no direction is indicated, will be voted to
approve the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in connection
with the merger. PerkinElmer’s board of directors does not
presently intend to bring any other business before the special
meeting. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the board knows of no other matters to be
brought before the special meeting. As to any other business
that may properly come before the special meeting, the persons
named as proxies in the accompanying PerkinElmer proxy will vote
those proxies in accordance with their judgment. A PerkinElmer
stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time
before it is exercised at the special meeting by:

• 

	delivering to the clerk of PerkinElmer a written notice, bearing
	a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy
	is revoked;

• 

	signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
	bearing a later date than the date of the previous proxy prior
	to the vote at the special meeting; or

• 

	attending the special meeting and voting in person.

However, if you as a PerkinElmer stockholder elect to vote in
person at the special meeting and your shares are held by a
broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring to the special
meeting a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee
authorizing you to vote the shares.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will share the costs, other
than fees of accountants and attorneys, of preparing and mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and PerkinElmer will bear
the other costs of the solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders. Following the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, PerkinElmer and its agents may solicit
proxies by mail, telephone or in person. PerkinElmer has
retained a proxy solicitation firm, Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Incorporated, to aid in the solicitation of
proxies. PerkinElmer will pay that firm an estimated fee of
$8,500, plus reimbursement of expenses. In addition, brokerage
houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries will send
beneficial owners the proxy materials. PerkinElmer will, upon
request, reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for
their reasonable expenses. PerkinElmer urges its stockholders to
vote proxies without delay.

Board Recommendation

PerkinElmer’s board of directors has voted to unanimously
approve the merger agreement and the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in the merger and believes that the merger is fair
and in the best interests of PerkinElmer and its stockholders.
Therefore, PerkinElmer’s board of directors unanimously
recommends that PerkinElmer stockholders vote FOR approval of
the issuance of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in the merger.

The proposed merger is of great importance to the stockholders
of PerkinElmer. Accordingly, PerkinElmer’s stockholders are
urged to read and carefully consider the information presented
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date,
sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope.



THE MERGER

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes
material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger
agreement. While PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience believe that
the description covers the material terms of the merger and the
related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this
entire document and the other documents referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully for a more complete
understanding of the merger.

Background of the Merger

During the past several years, the PerkinElmer board of
directors has regularly reviewed PerkinElmer’s long-term
objectives and strategic position, particularly in terms of
shifting PerkinElmer’s business strategy away from mature
markets and toward emerging and higher growth markets. As part
of this strategy, PerkinElmer management has considered various
strategic transactions, including acquisitions, alliances and
distribution agreements, with a number of life sciences
companies, including Packard BioScience.

The Packard BioScience board of directors regularly reviewed
Packard BioScience’s long-term strategies and objectives,
and in that connection has considered various strategic
alternatives, including pursuing the company’s business
plan as an independent entity, acquisitions and business
combinations.

On or about April 10, 2001, PerkinElmer’s senior
management decided to explore a possible business combination
with Packard BioScience. Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, initiated contact between the
two companies by telephoning Emery G. Olcott, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Packard BioScience, and Alexis P. Michas, a
member of Packard BioScience’s board of directors and a
representative of Stonington Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund,
L.P., a significant stockholder of Packard BioScience.
Messrs. Olcott and Michas indicated a willingness to engage
in discussions relating to a possible business combination.

On April 26, 2001, Mr. Summe and Mr. Michas met
in person to discuss the strategic benefits of such business
combination and its possible terms. Mr. Summe and
Mr. Michas discussed a number of issues relating to the
proposed transaction, including valuation, expected operational
efficiencies and other cost savings, representation on the
PerkinElmer board, liquidity and due diligence.

From April 27, 2001 through May 23, 2001, Terrance L.
Carlson, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of
PerkinElmer, and PerkinElmer’s financial advisor, Goldman,
Sachs & Co., engaged in several discussions with Packard
BioScience’s financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc., regarding potential valuations, financial models, business
due diligence and potential transaction structures.

On May 15, 2001, Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott met in
person to discuss the strategic benefits of a possible business
combination and various issues related to a possible transaction.

At a regular meeting of the board of directors of PerkinElmer on
May 17, 2001, management informed the board that
discussions were taking place with Packard BioScience regarding
a possible business combination. No formal vote was taken but
the directors supported the discussions.

After discussions among senior management of PerkinElmer, on
May 24, 2001, Mr. Summe sent a non-binding letter to
Mr. Olcott, outlining the terms and exchange ratios on
which PerkinElmer would entertain an acquisition of Packard
BioScience.

Following the May 24th letter, Messrs. Summe and
Olcott spoke by telephone and agreed that the management teams
of the two companies should meet on June 1, 2001 to continue
discussions.

On May 31, 2001, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience entered
into a mutual non-disclosure agreement that included each
party’s agreement not to purchase shares of the other
except in a consensual transaction.



On June 1, 2001, senior management of PerkinElmer and
PerkinElmer’s financial advisors met with senior management
of Packard BioScience and Packard BioScience’s financial
advisors. At this meeting, representatives from each company
presented financial and operational information to, and
participated in question and answer sessions with, the other.
The financial information presented included forecasts for the
periods 2001 to 2003. The forecasts for revenue, cash flow and
earnings were consistent with publicly available analysts
forecasts as reported by First Call. The parties also discussed
possible synergies resulting from a strategic combination and
various elements of valuation.

On June 5, 2001, after discussions with PerkinElmer senior
management, Mr. Summe sent Mr. Olcott a second non-binding
letter outlining revised terms of a possible transaction,
including valuation, and requesting items be made available to
PerkinElmer as part of its continuing business and financial due
diligence process.

On June 6, 2001, Mr. Olcott replied to Mr. Summe
by letter setting forth terms and exchange ratios that he would
be prepared to discuss with the Packard BioScience board of
directors in connection with a proposed transaction. After
reviewing this correspondence with Robert F. Friel, Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PerkinElmer, and
Mr. Carlson, Mr. Summe called Mr. Olcott to continue
discussions. Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott discussed
possible cost savings and other operational efficiencies and
their impact on valuation. Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott
agreed that PerkinElmer should commence its diligence regarding
possible cost savings and other operational efficiencies.

On June 8, 2001 the Packard BioScience board of directors
met by teleconference, together with its legal advisors and
JPMorgan, and reviewed the status of the discussions with
PerkinElmer. The Packard BioScience board also discussed
strategic alternatives available to the company and the
board’s duties and goals with respect to a potential
transaction. The Packard BioScience board of directors
authorized management to continue the discussions with
PerkinElmer.

Commencing on June 12, 2001, representatives of
PerkinElmer, including its consultants, accountants and outside
counsel, conducted due diligence, including a review of
documents made available at the offices of Packard
BioScience’s outside counsel and other documents made
available by Packard BioScience management.

On June 16, 2001, drafts of a merger agreement and related
documentation were distributed by counsel for PerkinElmer for
review by PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and its outside
counsel. From that date through July 12, 2001, PerkinElmer,
together with its counsel and other advisors, and Packard
BioScience, together with its counsel and other advisors,
negotiated the various terms of the merger agreement and related
documents.

On June 18, 2001, representatives of the parties, including
their senior management and financial advisors, met in person
for a presentation by Packard BioScience management relating to
its business. At this meeting, the parties further discussed
potential operational efficiencies and the results of diligence.

On June 19, 2001, representatives of the parties, including
their senior management, Stonington and the parties’
respective financial advisors, met in person for a second day
for a presentation by PerkinElmer management relating to its
business.

On June 22, 2001, Packard BioScience’s financial
advisors indicated that Packard BioScience had reservations
about the proposed valuation in light of recent trends in stock
prices. After further conversations, the parties agreed to
reassess the valuation and transaction structure, but that work
should continue on the agreements.

On July 3, 2001, Mr. Michas telephoned Mr. Summe
to propose a revised exchange ratio and consideration consisting
solely of PerkinElmer common stock, rather than common stock and
cash. Between July 3, 2001 and July 6, 2001,
Messrs. Summe, Michas, and Olcott engaged in several
telephone negotiations regarding the exchange ratio and form of
transaction consideration. On July 6, 2001, the parties
agreed on an exchange ratio and form of consideration, subject
to satisfactory completion of outstanding due diligence and
documentation.



From July 6, 2001 through July 12, 2001, the parties,
together with their respective outside counsel, engaged in
negotiations regarding the merger agreement and related
documentation, stockholder’s agreement and voting
agreements, including termination rights and fees,
non-solicitation provisions, representations and warranties and
covenants. During this period, final agreement on these and
other issues was reached over the course of several discussions
between management of and counsel to PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience. In addition, during this period, the parties
continued their diligence reviews with respect to each other and
prepared and discussed each party’s disclosure schedules to
the merger agreement.

Between July 9, 2001 and July 11, 2001,
Mr. Olcott spoke with each of Packard BioScience’s
outside directors individually to discuss the status of the
negotiations, and the terms of the proposed deal. During the
same period, representatives from JPMorgan spoke with each of
Packard BioScience’s outside directors to discuss the
fairness of the merger consideration, and to answer the
directors questions with respect to the proposed merger.

On July 13, 2001, the parties completed their diligence
reviews and finalized the terms of the merger agreement and
related documentation.

On July 13, 2001, PerkinElmer held a special meeting of its
board of directors to review the terms of the merger agreement
and related documents and to consider approval of the merger
agreement and the merger. PerkinElmer’s management reviewed
with the board the strategic benefits of the transaction and
Goldman Sachs reviewed with the board financial analyses
prepared in connection with its fairness opinion.
PerkinElmer’s outside legal counsel described the
provisions of the merger agreement and reviewed the board’s
responsibilities in connection with the proposed transaction.
Goldman Sachs presented its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, that, as of the date of its opinion and based on and
subject to the matters described in its opinion and such other
matters it considered relevant, the exchange ratio was fair from
a financial point of view to PerkinElmer. PerkinElmer’s
board of directors, after considering the terms of the merger
agreement and other related documents and the various
presentations, unanimously approved the merger and the merger
agreement and the related documentation. PerkinElmer’s
board of directors then authorized PerkinElmer’s management
to execute the merger agreement and related agreements.

On July 13, 2001, Packard BioScience held a special meeting
of its board of directors to review the terms of the merger
agreement and related documents and to consider the approval of
the merger agreement and the merger. Packard BioScience
management reviewed the strategic benefits of the transaction
and JPMorgan reviewed the financial analyses it performed in
connection with its opinion. JPMorgan presented its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date
of its opinion and based upon and subject to the matters stated
therein, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of the Packard BioScience common stock.
Packard BioScience outside legal counsel described the
provisions of the merger agreement and reviewed the board’s
responsibilities in connection with the proposed transaction.
The Packard BioScience board, after considering the terms of the
merger agreement and the other related documents and the various
presentations, unanimously approved the merger and the merger
agreement and the related documentation, concluding that the
consideration to be paid to Packard BioScience’s
stockholders in the merger was fair and in the best interests of
Packard BioScience and its stockholders. The Packard BioScience
board then authorized Packard BioScience’s management to
execute the merger agreement and related agreements.

On the evening of July 13, 2001, PerkinElmer,
PerkinElmer’s subsidiary, Pablo Acquisition Corp., and
Packard BioScience executed the merger agreement and the related
agreements.

Packard BioScience’s Reasons for the Merger

Packard BioScience’s board of directors has voted
unanimously to adopt the merger agreement and determined that
the merger is fair and in the best interests of Packard
BioScience and its stockholders. Accordingly, Packard
BioScience’s board recommends that Packard BioScience
stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. In reaching its decision, Packard



BioScience’s board of directors consulted with Packard
BioScience’s management and legal and financial advisors,
and considered the following material factors:

• 

The strategic fit between the products offered by Packard
	BioScience and those offered by PerkinElmer
. Packard
	BioScience’s management believes that adding the primary
	products offered by Packard BioScience, including liquid
	handling and automated sample preparation products, to
	PerkinElmer’s depth in instrumentation and reagent products
	will allow the combined company to offer a full spectrum of drug
	discovery tools to its customers and to be well-positioned to
	address emerging biochip, microarray and other life sciences
	opportunities with their combined technologies, including
	consumables, instrumentation and informatics software.

• 

The ability of the combined entity to take advantage of a
	larger and more geographically diverse customer base.

PerkinElmer has greater penetration of its sales force,
	customers and installed systems in different areas of the world,
	especially Europe, than does Packard BioScience. Packard
	BioScience’s management expects that Packard
	BioScience’s and PerkinElmer’s differing global
	presences will enable the combined company to make additional
	international sales.

• 

Ability of the combined entity to grow. 
Packard
	BioScience’s management believes that the combined entity
	will have greater financial strength relative to Packard
	BioScience as an independent company. With this financial
	strength, the combined company may be able to invest the large
	amount of capital in research and development needed to compete
	successfully in high-growth areas, such as proteomics, biochips
	and microarrays, that Packard BioScience might not be able to
	invest on a stand-alone basis. Moreover, Packard
	BioScience’s management believes that the combined company
	may have the ability to acquire companies that Packard
	BioScience would be less likely to acquire as an independent
	company.

• 

Synergies. 
Packard BioScience’s management believes
	that because of the complementary nature of various Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer businesses, there is an opportunity
	for significant cost savings. These cost savings are a potential
	benefit that Packard BioScience stockholders may realize as
	stockholders of PerkinElmer.

• 

Premium. 
Although the exchange ratio provided for in the
	merger agreement represents a premium of less than 1% for
	Packard BioScience common stock based on the closing prices for
	the shares of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer common stock on
	the date the merger agreement was executed, the exchange ratio
	represents a historical premium of approximately 18.9% for
	Packard BioScience common stock based upon the average of the
	respective closing sale prices for the shares of Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer common stock for the month prior to
	the signing of the merger agreement.

• 

Opportunity to participate in the combined company. 
The
	stock-for-stock transaction structure would allow Packard
	BioScience stockholders to participate in the growth and
	opportunities of the combined company and to continue to have an
	investment in the life sciences industry through a larger and
	more diversified enterprise.

However, there can be no assurances as to the extent, if any,
that the expectations of Packard BioScience’s management
will be realized. See the section entitled “Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

In the course of deliberations, the Packard BioScience board of
directors reviewed with Packard BioScience’s management and
its legal and financial advisors a number of additional factors
relevant to the merger, including the following:

• 

	historical information concerning Packard BioScience’s and
	PerkinElmer’s respective businesses, financial performance
	and condition, operations, management and competitive position,
	including public reports concerning results of operations during
	the most recent fiscal year and fiscal quarter for each company
	filed with the SEC;



• 

	the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of
	Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer before and after giving
	effect to the merger based on due diligence by management and
	Packard BioScience’s financial and legal advisors;

• 

	current financial market conditions and historical market
	prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
	Packard BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock;

• 

	the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties’
	respective representations, warranties and covenants, the
	conditions to the parties’ respective obligations, and the
	expected tax-free treatment of the exchange of Packard
	BioScience common stock for PerkinElmer common stock to Packard
	BioScience’s stockholders;

• 

	the terms of the stockholder’s agreement and the voting
	agreements described under the section entitled “Related
	Agreements — Stockholder and Voting Agreements”;

• 

	the potential for other third parties to enter into strategic
	relationships with or to acquire Packard BioScience;

• 

	the financial presentation of JPMorgan, including
	JPMorgan’s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
	to the Packard BioScience board of directors that, as of the
	date of its opinion and based upon and subject to the matters
	stated therein, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from
	a financial point of view, to the Packard BioScience
	stockholders, as described below under the caption
	“— Opinion of Packard BioScience’s Financial
	Advisor — J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.”; and

• 

	the impact of the merger on Packard BioScience’s employees
	and customers.

The Packard BioScience board of directors also considered the
provisions of the merger agreement regarding Packard
BioScience’s rights to consider and negotiate other
acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the
provisions regarding termination fees. The Packard BioScience
board of directors considered various alternatives to the
merger, including remaining as an independent company and
seeking other partners. The Packard BioScience board of
directors noted that there were a number of uncertainties over
the long-term if Packard BioScience remained an independent
company. The Packard BioScience board of directors considered
the probability that Packard BioScience stockholders would
prefer the benefits of being part of a larger, more diversified
entity rather than have Packard BioScience implement a long-term
strategic plan for profitable growth, which would be impacted by
the typical risks associated with implementation, as well as
general market and economic risks. The Packard BioScience board
of directors believed that these factors, including its review
of the terms of the merger agreement, supported the Packard
BioScience board of directors’ recommendation of the
merger, when viewed together with the risks and potential
benefits of the merger.

The Packard BioScience board of directors considered that in
connection with the merger, Stonington, Packard
BioScience’s largest stockholder, and other stockholders,
including executive officers of Packard BioScience, entered into
a stockholder’s agreement and voting agreements that
obligated these stockholders to vote their shares for the merger
and not to transfer their shares as long as the Packard
BioScience board of directors has not withdrawn or materially,
adversely modified its recommendation of the merger in response
to a superior proposal. Together, these stockholders hold a
majority of the outstanding common stock of Packard BioScience.
Under the stockholder’s agreement, Stonington would also
receive the right to nominate one director to the PerkinElmer
board of directors and registration rights with respect to the
PerkinElmer shares Stonington would receive in the merger.
However, the Packard BioScience board of directors also noted
that all Packard BioScience stockholders, including Stonington,
would receive the same exchange ratio and that Stonington
therefore would receive the same economic consideration as all
of the other Packard BioScience stockholders. The Packard
BioScience board of directors further noted that Stonington was
the only Packard BioScience stockholder that would require
registration rights with respect to the PerkinElmer shares to be
received in the merger, as virtually all other Packard
BioScience stockholders could freely sell their PerkinElmer
shares, and that Stonington currently has four out of eight
nominees on the Packard BioScience board of directors but would
only have one out of ten nominees on the PerkinElmer board of
directors. The Packard BioScience board of directors was aware
of these



interests, as well as the interests of various other persons in
the merger, and considered them in approving the merger
agreement and the merger. See below under the caption
“— Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger.”

The Packard BioScience board of directors also identified and
considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger, including but not limited
to:

• 

	the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might
	not be fully realized;

• 

	the possibility that the merger might not be completed and the
	potential adverse effect of the public announcement of the
	merger on:

• 

	Packard BioScience’s significant customers and other key
	relationships;

• 

	Packard BioScience’s ability to attract and retain key
	management, marketing and technical personnel; and

• 

	Packard BioScience’s overall competitive position;

• 

	the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key
	technical and management personnel might choose not to remain
	employed by the combined company; and

• 

	the other risks described under the section entitled “Risk
	Factors.”

The Packard BioScience board of directors believed that these
risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.
The above discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered
by the Packard BioScience board of directors. Each member of
Packard BioScience’s board of directors may have considered
different factors, and Packard BioScience’s board of
directors evaluated these factors as a whole and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors
considered.

Recommendation of Packard BioScience’s Board of
Directors

After careful consideration, Packard BioScience’s board of
directors has determined the merger to be fair and in the best
interests of Packard BioScience and its stockholders. Packard
BioScience’s board of directors voted unanimously to adopt
the merger agreement and recommends that the Packard BioScience
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the merger. In considering the
recommendation of the Packard BioScience board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, Packard BioScience stockholders
should be aware that some directors and officers of Packard
BioScience have interests in the merger that are different from,
or are in addition to, the interests of Packard BioScience
stockholders generally in the merger. Please see the description
below under the caption “— Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger.”

PerkinElmer’s Reasons for the Merger

The PerkinElmer board of directors voted unanimously to approve
the merger agreement and determined that the merger is fair and
in the best interests of PerkinElmer and its stockholders.
Accordingly, PerkinElmer’s board of directors unanimously
recommends that PerkinElmer stockholders vote FOR the issuance
of 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common stock for each share
of Packard BioScience common stock to be converted in connection
with the merger.

The decision of the PerkinElmer board of directors was based on
several potential benefits of the merger that it believes will
contribute to PerkinElmer’s success. These potential
benefits include:

• 

	growing PerkinElmer’s position in the life sciences
	research and drug discovery businesses;

• 

	enabling PerkinElmer to offer the full spectrum of drug
	discovery tools supported by a broad and focused worldwide
	sales, service and applications capability; and

• 

	expanding PerkinElmer’s product portfolio into the key
	strategic areas of liquid handling and automated sample
	preparation products.



The PerkinElmer board of directors reviewed a number of factors
in evaluating the merger, including but not limited to the
following:

• 

	historical information concerning PerkinElmer’s and Packard
	BioScience’s respective business focus, financial
	performance and condition, operations, technology and
	management, including public reports concerning results of
	operations during the most recent fiscal year and fiscal quarter
	for Packard BioScience filed with the SEC;

• 

	PerkinElmer management’s view of the financial condition,
	results of operations and business of PerkinElmer and Packard
	BioScience before and after giving effect to the merger and the
	determination by the PerkinElmer board of directors of the
	merger’s effect on stockholder value;

• 

	current financial market conditions and historical stock market
	prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
	PerkinElmer common stock and Packard BioScience common stock;

• 

	the consideration PerkinElmer will pay in the merger in light of
	comparable merger transactions;

• 

	the terms of the merger agreement;

• 

	the impact of the merger on PerkinElmer’s customers and
	employees;

• 

	results of the due diligence investigation conducted by
	PerkinElmer’s management, accountants, counsel and
	financial advisor; and

• 

	the financial presentation of Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
	including the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the PerkinElmer board
	of directors that the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
	agreement was, as of the date of its opinion, fair from a
	financial point of view to PerkinElmer as described below under
	the caption “— Opinion of PerkinElmer’s
	Financial Advisor — Goldman, Sachs & Co.”

During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger,
the PerkinElmer board also identified and considered a variety
of potentially negative factors that could materialize as a
result of the merger, including the following:

• 

	the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might
	not be fully realized;

• 

	the possibility that the merger might not be completed;

• 

	the effect of the public announcement of the merger on
	PerkinElmer’s and Packard BioScience’s business,
	including employees and customers;

• 

	the risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals
	required to complete the merger; and

• 

	other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
	under the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

PerkinElmer’s board of directors concluded that these
factors were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.
The above discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered
by PerkinElmer’s board of directors. Each member of
PerkinElmer’s board of directors may have considered
different factors, and PerkinElmer’s board of directors
evaluated these factors as a whole and did not quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the factors considered.

Recommendation of PerkinElmer’s Board of Directors

After careful consideration, the PerkinElmer board of directors
has determined the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in the
merger to be fair and in the best interests of PerkinElmer and
its stockholders. PerkinElmer’s board of directors voted
unanimously to approve the merger agreement and the issuance of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger and
unanimously recommends that the PerkinElmer stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in the merger.



Opinion of PerkinElmer’s Financial Advisor —
Goldman, Sachs & Co.

On July 13, 2001, at the meeting of the PerkinElmer board
of directors, Goldman Sachs delivered to the PerkinElmer board
its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in a written
opinion, that as of that date the exchange ratio pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
PerkinElmer.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated
July 13, 2001, which identifies assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in
connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference. You should read the opinion in its entirety. Goldman
Sachs’ advisory services and the opinion of Goldman Sachs
were provided for the information and assistance of the
PerkinElmer board in connection with its consideration of the
merger and do not constitute a recommendation as to how holders
of PerkinElmer common stock should vote.

In connection with this opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among
other things:

• 

	the merger agreement;

• 

	the Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the
	Prospectus dated April  20, 2000 contained therein,
	relating to Packard BioScience’s initial public offering of
	Packard BioScience common stock;

• 

	Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on
	Form 10-K of PerkinElmer for the four years ended
	December 31, 2000, and of Packard BioScience for the year
	ended December 31, 2000;

• 

	interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
	Form 10-Q of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience;

• 

	other communications from PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience to
	their respective stockholders;

• 

	internal financial analyses and forecasts for Packard BioScience
	prepared by its management; and

• 

	internal financial analyses and forecasts for Packard BioScience
	and PerkinElmer prepared by PerkinElmer’s management,
	including certain cost savings and revenue and operating
	synergies forecasted by the management of PerkinElmer to result
	from the merger.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
management of PerkinElmer regarding their assessment of the
strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the
merger and with members of the senior management of PerkinElmer
and Packard BioScience regarding the past and current business
operations, financial condition, and future prospects of their
respective companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

• 

	reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Packard
	BioScience common stock and the PerkinElmer common stock;

• 

	compared certain financial and stock market information for
	Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer with similar information for
	certain other companies the securities of which are publicly
	traded;

• 

	reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
	combinations in the life science industry specifically and in
	other industries generally; and

• 

	performed such other studies and analyses as it considered
	appropriate.

Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial, accounting and other information discussed
with or reviewed by it and assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of the
PerkinElmer board, that the financial analyses and forecasts
referred to above, including the cost savings and revenue and
operating synergies referred to above, were reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of PerkinElmer as of the date of its opinion, and that



such forecasted cost savings and synergies would be realized in
the amounts and time periods contemplated thereby. These
forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure.

Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Packard BioScience or
PerkinElmer or any of their subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of
the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on
PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience or on the contemplated
benefits of the merger.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses
used by Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion
dated July 13, 2001 to the PerkinElmer board. This summary
includes information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand fully the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs
these tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. You should understand that the order of analyses and
results derived from these analyses described below do not
represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses
by Goldman Sachs.

Exchange Ratio And Premium Analyses.
 Goldman Sachs
calculated the ratio of the average closing market price of
Packard BioScience common stock to the average closing market
price of PerkinElmer common stock, over selected periods ending
on July 12, 2001, and the resulting implied transaction
premiums as compared with the 0.311 exchange ratio contemplated
by the merger agreement as follows:

Goldman Sachs also calculated as of July 12, 2001 the ratio
of the closing market price of PerkinElmer common stock to the
average closing market price of Packard BioScience common stock
(the last trading day before the signing of the merger
agreement) was 0.311x, which indicated no transaction premium.

Selected Companies Analysis.
 Goldman Sachs reviewed and
compared certain financial information relating to Packard
BioScience to corresponding financial information and public
market multiples for the following five publicly traded
companies in the life sciences industry that, for purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to Packard BioScience:

• 

	Applera Corporation;

• 

	Millipore Corporation;

• 

	Molecular Devices Corporation;

• 

	Thermo Electron Corporation; and

• 

	Waters Corporation.

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial
multiples and ratios. The multiples for Packard BioScience and
each of the five selected companies were calculated using their
closing prices on July 12, 2001. The multiples and ratios
for Packard BioScience and for each of the selected companies
were based on the most recent publicly available information and
IBES estimates for 2001 earnings.



The results of these analyses are as follows:

Pro Forma Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs prepared a pro forma
analysis of the financial impact of the acquisition. Using
earnings estimates for 2002 and 2003 furnished by PerkinElmer,
Goldman Sachs compared the earnings per share of PerkinElmer
common stock on a stand-alone basis and Packard BioScience
common stock on a stand-alone basis, to the earnings per share
of the common stock of the pro forma combined company. Goldman
Sachs performed this analysis based on the exchange ratio of
0.311 and under two scenarios reflecting cost savings and
operating synergies forecasted by the management of PerkinElmer
to result from the merger:

• 

	Scenario I — assuming no synergies; and

• 

	Scenario II — assuming $20 million in pre-tax
	synergies are realized in 2002 and $26.5 million in pre-tax
	synergies are realized in 2003.

This analysis indicated that:

• 

	assuming Scenario I, the merger would be
	dilutive — that is, would represent a reduction to
	both 2002 and 2003 stand-alone earnings per share of PerkinElmer
	common stock; and

• 

	assuming Scenario II, the merger would be dilutive in 2002 and
	accretive in 2003 to the stand-alone earnings per share of
	PerkinElmer common stock.

Selected Transactions Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs analyzed
certain information relating to the proposed transaction in
relation to certain publicly available information for 12
comparable transactions in the life sciences industry. Such
analysis indicated that for the selected transactions the
multiples paid in such transactions compared to:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:
 Goldman Sachs calculated a
range of implied prices per Packard BioScience common share
using a discounted cash flow valuation of estimated free cash
flows through 2005, discount rates ranging from 11% to 13% and
terminal 2005 EBITDA multiples ranging from 10x to 18x. The
estimated free cash flows utilized were prepared by the
management of PerkinElmer and assume a revenue growth of 20%
after 2003. This analysis produced implied prices per Packard
BioScience common share ranging from $6.50 to $12.23 without
synergies and $8.38 to $16.11 with synergies.

Contribution Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs analyzed the
relative income statement contribution of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience to the pro forma combined company resulting
from the acquisition and based on forecasts provided by
PerkinElmer. The analysis showed that on a pro forma combined
basis,



both including all revenue and cost synergies and excluding such
synergies, Packard BioScience would account for approximately
the following percentages in 2001-2003 of the combined entity:

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and
is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of
all these analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience or the contemplated transaction.

The analyses were prepared for purposes of Goldman Sachs
providing its opinion to the PerkinElmer board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
to PerkinElmer. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals
or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Analyses based on forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors, none of PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience, Goldman Sachs
or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecasts.

Although Goldman Sachs evaluated the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the exchange ratio to PerkinElmer, the
exchange ratio itself was determined by PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience through arm’s-length negotiations. PerkinElmer
did not provide specific instructions to, or place any
limitations on, Goldman Sachs with respect to the procedures to
be followed or factors to be considered by Goldman Sachs in
performing its analyses or providing its opinion.

As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the
PerkinElmer board was among many factors taken into
consideration by the PerkinElmer board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with such
opinion and is qualified by reference to the written opinion of
Goldman Sachs set forth in Annex B.

Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with PerkinElmer, having
provided certain investment banking services to PerkinElmer from
time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with its acquisition of PerkinElmer’s Analytical
Instruments Business in June 1999 and its divestiture of
EG&G Technical Services business in August 1999; having
acted as lead managing underwriter with respect to the sale of
$460,000,000 Zero Coupon Convertible Notes of PerkinElmer in
August 2000; and having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with, and having participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.

PerkinElmer selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor
because it is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to
the merger.

Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and
securities services and, in the course of its normal trading
activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold
securities including,



derivatives securities, of PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience for
its own account and for the account of customers.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated July 13, 2001,
PerkinElmer engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the
terms of this engagement letter, PerkinElmer agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs a fee of $5.5 million upon the consummation of the
merger. PerkinElmer also agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees
and disbursements of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Goldman
Sachs and related parties against certain liabilities arising
out of or in connection with Goldman Sachs’ engagement. In
the past, Goldman Sachs, in the ordinary course of business, has
from time to time provided investment banking services to
PerkinElmer for which Goldman Sachs received usual and customary
compensation, and in the future may continue to provide such
services.

Opinion of Packard BioScience’s Financial
Advisor — J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

JPMorgan acted as Packard BioScience’s financial advisor in
connection with the merger. Packard BioScience requested
JPMorgan, in its role as a financial advisor, to evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
in the merger to the holders of Packard BioScience common stock.
On July 13, 2001, JPMorgan delivered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Packard BioScience
board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to certain matters stated therein, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Packard BioScience common stock.

The full text of the JPMorgan fairness opinion, which sets
forth the assumptions made, factors considered and limitations
upon the review undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its opinion,
is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.
JPMorgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Packard
BioScience board of directors, was directed only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
in the merger to the holders of Packard BioScience common stock
and does not constitute a recommendation to any Packard
BioScience stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote on
the merger or any other matter. The following summary of the
material provisions of the JPMorgan fairness opinion is
qualified by reference to such opinion. Packard BioScience
stockholders are urged to read this opinion in its entirety.

In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:

• 

	reviewed the merger agreement;

• 

	reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
	information concerning Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer and
	the industries in which they operate;

• 

	compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the
	publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
	involving companies JPMorgan deemed relevant and the
	consideration received for such companies;

• 

	compared the financial and operating performance of Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer with publicly available information
	concerning certain other companies JPMorgan deemed relevant;

• 

	reviewed the current and historical market prices of Packard
	BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock and certain
	publicly traded securities of such other companies;

• 

	reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts
	prepared by the managements of Packard BioScience and
	PerkinElmer relating to their respective businesses, as well as
	the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related
	expenses and synergies that Packard BioScience expects to result
	from the merger; and

• 

	performed such other financial studies and analyses and
	considered such other information as JPMorgan deemed appropriate
	for the purposes of its opinion.



JPMorgan also held discussions with certain members of the
management of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer with respect to
certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business
operations of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer and certain other matters believed
necessary or appropriate to JPMorgan’s inquiry.

In rendering its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed,
without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of all information that was publicly available or that was
furnished to it by Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer or
otherwise reviewed by it, and JPMorgan did not assume any
responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan did not conduct
any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
were any valuations or appraisals provided to it. In relying on
financial analyses and forecasts provided to it, including the
synergies provided by Packard BioScience, JPMorgan assumed that
they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments by
management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer to
which such analyses or forecasts relate. In addition, JPMorgan
assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes,
and that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement will be completed as described in the
merger agreement. JPMorgan relied as to all legal matters
relevant to the rendering of its opinion upon the advice of
counsel. JPMorgan further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the completion of the merger will be obtained
without any adverse effect on Packard BioScience or PerkinElmer
or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

The forecasts furnished to JPMorgan for Packard BioScience and
PerkinElmer were prepared by the managements of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer, respectively. Neither Packard
BioScience nor PerkinElmer publicly discloses internal
management forecasts of the type provided to JPMorgan in
connection with JPMorgan’s analysis of the exchange ratio
in the merger, and such forecasts were not prepared with a view
toward public disclosure. These forecasts were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may
be beyond the control of the respective managements, including,
without limitation, factors related to general economic and
competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those
set forth in such forecasts.

JPMorgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to JPMorgan as of, the date of its opinion.
Subsequent developments may affect the opinion, and JPMorgan
does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such
opinion. JPMorgan’s opinion was limited to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Packard
BioScience common stock of the exchange ratio in the merger, and
JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the underlying decision of
Packard BioScience to engage in the merger. JPMorgan expressed
no opinion as to the price at which Packard BioScience common
stock or PerkinElmer common stock will trade at any future time.

JPMorgan’s opinion noted that JPMorgan was not authorized
to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any
other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of
Packard BioScience or any other alternative transaction.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice,
JPMorgan employed generally accepted valuation methods in
reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of certain of
the financial analyses presented to the Packard BioScience board
of directors at its meeting on July 13, 2001, which
analyses were also among those considered by JPMorgan in
connection with delivering its opinion. Some of the analyses
include information presented in a tabular format. To understand
fully the financial analyses used by JPMorgan, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. This summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses underlying the opinion of JPMorgan.

Based upon the reference ranges derived from the public
companies analysis for Packard BioScience and both the
diversified companies and the sum-of-the-parts analyses for
PerkinElmer, JPMorgan calculated an implied exchange ratio by
comparing the implied per share equity values of Packard
BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock. The
analysis yielded the following implied exchange ratios (rounded
to the nearest thousandth), in each case compared to the
proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

Precedent Transactions Analysis.
 JPMorgan reviewed
certain publicly available information regarding selected
business combinations in the life sciences technology industry
announced since August 1997. These transactions and the
month in which each transaction was announced were as follows:

• 

	Aurora Biosciences Corporation/ Vertex Pharmaceuticals
	Incorporated (April  2001);

• 

	GSI Life Sciences (a division of GSI Lumonics, Inc.)/ Packard
	BioScience (August 2000);

• 

	Dexter Corporation/ Invitrogen Corporation (July 2000);

• 

	NEN Life Sciences, Inc./ PerkinElmer (June 2000);

• 

	Operon Technologies, Inc./ Qiagen N.V. (June 2000);

• 

	LJL Biosystems, Inc./ Molecular Devices Corporation
	(June 2000);

• 

	Genetic Microsystems, Inc./ Affymetrix, Inc.
	(September 1999);

• 

	Molecular Dynamics, Inc./ Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.
	(August 1998); and

• 

	PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc./ Applera Corporation (formerly known
	as Perkin-Elmer Corporation) (August 1997).

This analysis indicated that the transaction value as a multiple
of last twelve-months revenues, adjusted to reflect the change
in the index of stocks comprising the public companies listed
above in the public companies analysis for Packard BioScience
from the date of each transaction to July 12, 2001, ranged
from approximately 1.4x to 12.7x, with a mean of approximately
4.1x and a median of approximately 4.6x.

Based upon the precedent transactions for Packard BioScience and
the public companies analysis for PerkinElmer set forth above,
JPMorgan calculated an implied exchange ratio by comparing the
implied per share equity values of Packard BioScience common
stock and PerkinElmer common stock. The analysis yielded the
following implied exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest
thousandth), in each case compared to the proposed exchange
ratio of 0.311:

Relative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
 JPMorgan
performed discounted cash flow analyses for each of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer using:

• 

	financial forecasts for Packard BioScience provided by Packard
	BioScience for years 2001 through 2005, and financial forecasts
	for PerkinElmer provided by PerkinElmer for years 2001 through
	2004, with 2005 extrapolated based on 2004 growth rates and
	margins; and

• 

	estimated synergies provided by Packard BioScience.

JPMorgan calculated a discounted cash flow analysis for Packard
BioScience assuming discount rates ranging from 12% to 15%, and
terminal multiples of EBIT in the year 2005 ranging from 15.0x
to 20.0x, and for PerkinElmer assuming discount rates ranging
from 9.0% to 13.0%, and terminal multiples of EBITDA in the year
2005 ranging from 11.0x to 13.0x. Based upon the estimated
valuation ranges of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer set forth
above, JPMorgan calculated an implied exchange ratio of a share
of PerkinElmer common stock to a share of Packard BioScience
common stock. The analysis yielded the following implied
exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest thousandth), in each
case compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

JPMorgan also performed discounted cash flow analyses for each
of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer using financial forecasts
for Packard BioScience from publicly available data and research
analyst estimates and financial forecasts for PerkinElmer from
PerkinElmer management. Using the same discount rates and
terminal multiples described above, JPMorgan calculated an
implied exchange ratio of a share of PerkinElmer common stock to
a share of Packard BioScience common stock. The analysis yielded
the following implied exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest
thousandth), in each case compared to the proposed exchange
ratio of 0.311:

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
 JPMorgan reviewed the
per share daily closing market price movements of Packard
BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock for the
one-year period ending July 12, 2001, and calculated the
historical exchange ratios during this period implied by dividing



the daily closing prices per share of Packard BioScience common
stock by those of PerkinElmer common stock and the average of
those historical trading ratios for the one-day, one-month,
three-month, six-month and one-year periods ending July 12,
2001. The analysis resulted in the following average historical
trading ratios for the periods indicated (rounded to the nearest
hundredth), compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

The highest historical exchange ratio on any single day during
the 1-year period was approximately 0.843x, and the lowest
historical exchange ratio on any single day during this period
was approximately 0.163x, compared to the proposed exchange
ratio of 0.311x.

Contribution Analysis. 
JPMorgan estimated the
contribution of each of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer to
the pro forma combined company with respect to revenue, earnings
before interest, taxes and amortization, which is referred to as
EBITA, and earnings for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 using
financial forecasts for Packard BioScience provided by Packard
BioScience and for PerkinElmer provided by PerkinElmer. The
analysis showed that Packard BioScience would contribute
approximately the following percentages of estimated revenues,
EBITA and earnings in 2001 and 2002:

compared to the approximately 17.6% pro forma ownership of the
combined company by Packard BioScience stockholders.

Based upon the contribution analysis set forth above, JPMorgan
calculated an implied exchange ratio of a share of PerkinElmer
common stock to a share of Packard BioScience common stock. The
analysis yielded the following implied exchange ratios (rounded
to the nearest thousandth), in each case compared to the
proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

Pro Forma Analysis.
 JPMorgan also analyzed certain pro
forma effects resulting from the merger, including the potential
impact of the merger on forecasted earnings per share of
PerkinElmer following the merger, using earnings per share
forecasts for Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer provided by the
managements of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, respectively,
for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The following table reflects the
accretion/ dilution analysis assuming varying levels of
synergies, 50% of which are achieved in 2002 and 100% of which
are achieved in 2003:

The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is
not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. JPMorgan believes that the summary set forth above
and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions thereof, without considering all of its
analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan based its analyses
on assumptions that it deemed reasonable, including assumptions
concerning general business and economic conditions and
industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon
which JPMorgan based its analyses are set forth above under the
description of each such analysis. JPMorgan’s analyses are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future
results that might be achieved, which values may be higher or
lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan’s analyses
are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise
reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be
bought or sold.

None of the public companies used in the public companies
analysis described above is identical to Packard BioScience or
PerkinElmer, and none of the precedent transactions used in the
precedent transactions analysis described above is identical to
the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly traded
comparable companies and transactions is not mathematical;
rather it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors
that could affect the public trading value of the comparable
companies or company to which they are being compared.

As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its
affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
estate, corporate and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to
advise Packard BioScience with respect to the merger and deliver
an opinion to the Packard BioScience board of directors with
respect to the exchange ratio in the merger on the basis of such
experience and its familiarity with Packard BioScience.

For services rendered in connection with the merger and the
delivery of its opinion, Packard BioScience has agreed to pay
JPMorgan a fee equal to 0.70% of the aggregate consideration
paid at the closing of the merger, measured at the date of
closing of the merger and including Packard BioScience debt
assumed by PerkinElmer, payable upon the closing of the merger.
In addition, Packard BioScience has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan
for its expenses incurred in connection with its services,
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will
indemnify JPMorgan against certain liabilities, including
liabilities arising under the Federal securities laws.

In the past, JPMorgan and its affiliates, in the ordinary course
of business, have from time to time provided investment banking
and commercial banking services to Packard BioScience and
PerkinElmer, respectively, for which JPMorgan received usual and
customary compensation, and in the future may continue to
provide such services. An affiliate of JPMorgan holds a limited
partnership interest in Stonington Capital Appreciation Fund
1994, L.P., representing approximately 0.75% of the total
capital commitments in the fund.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their businesses,
JPMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and
equity securities of Packard BioScience or PerkinElmer for their
own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,
they may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

When Packard BioScience stockholders consider the recommendation
of the board with respect to the merger, they should be aware
that some officers and directors of Packard BioScience have
interests in connection with the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the Packard BioScience
stockholders, as summarized below. In making their decision to
recommend the merger, the



Packard BioScience board was aware of these interests and
considered them among the other matters described above under
the section entitled “The Merger — Packard
BioScience’s Reasons for the Merger.”

Employment Agreements.
 Packard BioScience has entered
into employment agreements with Emery G. Olcott,
Franklin R. Witney, Ben D. Kaplan, Staf C.
van Cauter, and Timothy O. White, Jr. Each of the
employment agreements provides for an initial employment term of
two years, except for an initial employment term of three years
in the case of Mr. Kaplan. Under each employment agreement,
the initial employment term is automatically extended for
additional 25-month terms (13-month terms for Dr. Witney
and Mr. van Cauter) on a specified initial renewal
date and on the first day of each calendar month that follows
the initial renewal date, unless Packard BioScience
affirmatively gives 60 days notice that it will not be
renewing the agreement on a renewal date. The initial renewal
date has already occurred for each of the executives other than
Dr. Witney, whose initial employment term continues until
December 18, 2002, and whose initial renewal date is
December 18, 2001 (see a description of
Dr. Witney’s new employment arrangement with
PerkinElmer described below).

Under these employment agreements, upon a termination of the
executive’s employment by Packard BioScience other than for
“cause,” “death” or “disability,”
or upon a termination of employment by the executive for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
employment agreements), the executive would be entitled to an
amount in cash equal to the sum of: (i) the accrued annual
base salary as of the date of termination; (ii) a pro rata
portion of the target annual bonus accrued to the date of
termination and any other accrued but unpaid annual bonuses;
(iii) accrued vacation pay and deferred compensation not
yet paid; (iv) annual base salary and annual bonus amounts
for the remainder of the employment term (or, in the case of Dr.
Witney, for the longer of the remainder of his employment term
or 180 days); and (v) additional contributions to the
thrift savings plan, if any, to which the executive would have
been entitled had his employment continued for a period of two
years (three years in the case of Mr. Olcott) after the
date of termination. In addition, the executive would be
entitled to participate in all welfare benefit plans for a
period of two years (three years in the case of Mr. Olcott)
after the date of termination on terms at least as favorable as
those that would have been applicable had his employment not
been terminated (or, if such benefit plans are not available,
the executive will receive a cash payment of comparable value),
and, to the extent that any form of compensation or benefits is
not fully vested, the executive would be credited with
additional service of two years (three years in the case of
Mr. Olcott and Dr. Witney) after the date of
termination. Mr. Olcott would additionally be entitled to
continue to receive all perquisites that he had been receiving
at the time of the termination of his employment, for a period
of three years.

In addition, the executive would be entitled to a “gross
up” payment reimbursing the executive on an after-tax basis
for any excise tax liability incurred by the executive with
respect to payments made in connection with a change of control
under the agreement, unless a reduction of less than $30,000 in
the payments due to the executive would result in the avoidance
of the excise tax, in which case the payments would be so
reduced. Both Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer have agreed in
the merger agreement that consummation of the merger will
trigger the right in the employment agreements of
Messrs. Olcott, Kaplan, van Cauter, and White to terminate
employment for “good reason.” If these executive
officers were to terminate employment for “good
reason” immediately upon consummation of the merger, and
assuming that consummation of the merger occurs on
December 31, 2001, they would be entitled to the following
approximate severance amounts under their contracts. These
amounts do not include any accrued base salary, vacation, or
deferred compensation, any welfare benefits continuation or
accelerated vesting, or any gross-up payments:

• Mr. Olcott

$

1,735,500;

• Mr. Kaplan

$

934,500;

• Mr. van Cauter

$

382,500;

and

• Mr. White

$

586,000.

Each of the employment agreements (other than those of
Messrs. Kaplan and White) provides that, during the
employment of the executives and for a stated period after the
termination of the employment



term, each executive will not solicit any of our employees or
compete with us. In consideration for such noncompetition and
nonsolicitation covenants, Packard BioScience will pay to each
executive one-half of the sum of his annual base salary and his
target annual bonus (100% in the case of Mr. Olcott), such
amount payable in equal monthly installments during the portion
of the relevant restricted period following the date of
termination.

Witney Employment Agreement.
 In connection with the
merger, PerkinElmer and Dr. Witney entered into a new
employment arrangement, contingent upon consummation of the
merger. This new arrangement will supersede
Dr. Witney’s present employment agreement with Packard
BioScience, described above, upon completion of the merger. The
new employment arrangement generally retains the obligation of
Packard BioScience to provide excise tax “gross up”
payments to Dr. Witney in the event that he becomes subject
to change of control related excise taxes with respect to
payments and benefits Dr. Witney receives in connection
with the merger, with PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience as
joint obligors.

The new arrangement provides for Dr. Witney’s
employment as a Vice President of PerkinElmer, effective upon
completion of the merger. Dr. Witney will receive a
starting annual base salary of $300,000. In addition, he will be
provided with a stock option grant to purchase 150,000 shares of
PerkinElmer common stock under the PerkinElmer, Inc. 2001
Incentive Plan, with a grant price equal to the average of the
high and the low price of PerkinElmer common stock on the date
of the grant (the date Dr. Witney accepted the offer, July
12, 2001), which will vest generally on a performance basis.
PerkinElmer will grant Dr. Witney 5,000 restricted shares
of PerkinElmer common stock that will also vest on a performance
basis. Dr. Witney will be granted an additional 15,000
restricted shares of PerkinElmer common stock that will vest one
year from the closing date of the merger. Dr. Witney’s
employment arrangement will have a one-year term, renewable on a
yearly basis by the board of directors of PerkinElmer.
Dr. Witney will be eligible to participate in any and all
bonus, benefit, pension, compensation, and option plans which,
pursuant to PerkinElmer policy, are available to persons in
similar positions within PerkinElmer. In addition, PerkinElmer
has agreed to provide Dr. Witney with a company-paid
apartment in the Boston area with a lease cost of up to $3,500 a
month.

Dr. Witney’s employment agreement provides for certain
benefits in the event PerkinElmer experiences a change of
control (as defined in the agreement). Under such a
circumstance, PerkinElmer will continue to employ Dr. Witney in
a management position for three years following the date of the
change of control. The agreement also provides that if
Dr. Witney is terminated other than for “cause”
(as defined in the agreement) during the three years following
the change of control of PerkinElmer, or if Dr. Witney
terminates his employment for “good reason” (as
defined in the agreement) within this three-year period,
Dr. Witney will be entitled to receive a lump-sum severance
payment generally equal to the sum of (1) his unpaid base
salary through the date of termination, (2) a pro rata
bonus for the year of termination and (3) three times the
sum of his annual base salary plus any bonus or incentive
payments received by Dr. Witney in the last full fiscal
year of PerkinElmer. Also, for this three-year period,
Dr. Witney will be eligible to participate in all employee
benefit plans and arrangements of PerkinElmer to the same extent
and on the same terms as were effective immediately prior to his
termination. An additional excise tax “gross-up”
payment would be required under the employment agreement to
compensate Dr. Witney in the event that any golden
parachute excise taxes are levied upon him in connection with a
change of control of PerkinElmer.

Accelerated Vesting of Stock Options and Restricted
Stock.
 Pursuant to Packard BioScience’s 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Option Compensation
Plan, all stock options held by Packard BioScience employees and
directors will fully vest upon consummation of the merger. The
restrictions upon all restricted stock granted under Packard
BioScience’s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan will lapse upon
consummation of the merger. Messrs. Olcott, Witney, Kaplan,
van Cauter, and White currently hold, respectively, 136,250,
131,250, 72,000, 34,000 and 45,450 unvested Packard BioScience
options, all of which will vest upon consummation of the merger
(to the extent that they do not vest sooner in accordance with
their normal vesting schedules). Dr. Witney holds 100,000
shares of Packard BioScience



restricted stock, the restrictions upon which will lapse upon
consummation of the merger (to the extent that they do not lapse
sooner in accordance with their normal vesting schedules).

Retention Bonuses.
 In connection with the merger, Packard
BioScience is implementing a retention bonus program to
encourage certain employees to remain with Packard BioScience
until and shortly after the merger, and has set aside
approximately $6,600,000 for this retention program. Pursuant to
this program, it is currently anticipated that Dr. Witney
will receive a bonus of approximately $900,000 if he remains
employed by Packard BioScience through the date of the
consummation of the merger. No other executive officers of
Packard BioScience will participate in the retention program.

401(k) Plan.
 The merger agreement grants PerkinElmer the
right to require that Packard BioScience terminate its 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction.
If the 401(k) Plan is so terminated, all unvested employer
matching contributions to the plan will immediately vest upon
such termination, pursuant to the terms of the plan. As of
July 27, 2001, Mr. White held unvested matching
contributions with an approximate value of $4,068.39.
Mr. White is the only executive officer of Packard
BioScience who has unvested employer matching contributions to
the plan.

Indemnification. 
The merger agreement provides that
PerkinElmer will indemnify Packard BioScience officers and
directors against matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the effective time of the merger for six years after the merger.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —
Covenants of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience —
Director and Officer Indemnification.”

Interests of Other Stockholders. 
Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., Packard BioScience’s largest
stockholder, entered into a stockholder’s agreement with
PerkinElmer in connection with the merger.

Under the stockholder’s agreement, Stonington is obligated
to vote 30,898,890 shares of Packard BioScience common stock,
and to direct the vote of 1,123,590 shares of Packard BioScience
common stock over which Stonington has the power to direct the
vote, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
Stonington has also agreed not to transfer any of the shares
that it owns and not to consent to the transfer of the shares
over which it has the power to direct the vote, as long as the
Packard BioScience board of directors does not withdraw or
knowingly modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation
of the merger in response to a superior proposal in accordance
with, and subject to the limitations of, the merger agreement.
In addition, Stonington is entitled to registration rights with
respect to the PerkinElmer stock it would receive in the merger
and may nominate one director to the PerkinElmer board of
directors.

Richard T. McKernan, Virginia J. McKernan, Barbara P. Olcott,
Emery G. Olcott, the Timothy S. Olcott Trust, Timothy O. White,
Jr. and Franklin R. Witney have also each entered into voting
agreements with PerkinElmer, which require them to vote a total
of 2,368,975 shares of Packard BioScience common stock owned by
them as of August 21, 2001 to adopt the merger agreement,
as long as the Packard BioScience board of directors does not
withdraw or knowingly modify in a material adverse manner its
recommendation of the merger in response to a superior proposal
in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, the
merger agreement. See the section entitled “Related
Agreements — Stockholder and Voting Agreements.”

In addition, PerkinElmer and Messrs. Olcott, Kaplan and
White have discussed entering into consulting arrangements,
under which Messrs. Olcott, Kaplan and White would provide
consulting services related to integration issues from the
merger.

Treatment of Packard BioScience Common Stock

In the merger, each share of Packard BioScience common stock
will be converted into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock.

Holders of Packard BioScience common stock should not send in
any certificates representing Packard BioScience common stock.
Following the effective time of the merger, holders of Packard
BioScience common stock will receive instructions for the
surrender and exchange of their stock certificates.



Accounting Treatment of the Merger

In accordance with the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger, as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmer’s financial statements prospectively as of the
completion of the merger.

Effect on PerkinElmer Stock Options and Warrants

No adjustment to any outstanding PerkinElmer stock options or
warrants will occur as a result of the merger.

Regulatory Approvals

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
PerkinElmer may not complete the acquisition of shares of
Packard BioScience common stock in the merger until
notifications have been furnished to the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice and the required waiting periods have been satisfied
or terminated. The obligation to file falls upon PerkinElmer, as
the acquiring company, and upon Stonington Capital Appreciation
1994 Fund, L.P., due to its control of Packard BioScience, the
acquired company. This control, as defined by the pre-merger
notification rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission,
derives from Stonington’s ability to designate 50% or more
of the directors of Packard BioScience. The initial waiting
period is 30 days after both PerkinElmer and Stonington
have filed their required pre-merger notification and report
forms. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission or the
Antitrust Division may issue, during the initial waiting period,
a second request, requiring PerkinElmer and Stonington to submit
additional information and documentary materials. If such a
second request were to be issued, it would extend the waiting
period until a date 30 days after PerkinElmer and
Stonington substantially complied with their obligations under
the second request. However, if either the initial or second
30-day period ends on a weekend or legal holiday, then the
waiting period is extended to the next business day. PerkinElmer
and Stonington each filed a pre-merger notification and report
form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division on July 20, 2001. In addition, prior to closing
the merger, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience must make any
necessary filings with, and satisfy any applicable waiting
periods imposed by, foreign and other antitrust authorities
where the failure to file or satisfy would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience.

At any time before the effective time of the merger, the
Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission or a private
person or entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other
things, to enjoin the merger and any time after the effective
time of the merger, to cause PerkinElmer to divest itself, in
whole or in part, of the surviving corporation of the merger or
of businesses conducted by the surviving corporation of the
merger. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger
will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, PerkinElmer
will prevail. The obligations of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience to complete the merger is subject to the condition
that any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act shall have expired or terminated. See the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Obligations
to Complete the Merger.”

Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

The discussion below summarizes the anticipated material United
States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to
United States holders of Packard BioScience common stock who,
pursuant to the merger, exchange their Packard BioScience common
stock solely for PerkinElmer common



stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. This discussion is
based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, currently applicable United States Treasury regulations
and judicial and administrative decisions and rulings. This
discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service.
Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
interpretations could alter or modify the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion, and these changes or
interpretations could be retroactive and could affect the tax
consequences of the merger to PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience
and the stockholders of Packard BioScience.

The discussion below does not deal with all aspects of federal
income taxation that may affect particular stockholders in light
of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for
stockholders subject to special treatment under federal income
tax law. Stockholders subject to special treatment include
insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial
institutions, broker-dealers, foreign individuals and entities,
stockholders who hold their stock as part of a hedge,
appreciated financial position, constructive sale, straddle or
conversion transaction, stockholders who do not hold their stock
as capital assets and stockholders who have acquired their stock
upon exercise of employee options or otherwise as compensation.
In addition, the discussion below does not consider the effect
of any applicable state, local or foreign tax laws. In addition,
this discussion does not address the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently
with, the merger, whether or not such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger or the consequences of
the assumption by PerkinElmer of outstanding Packard BioScience
stock options.

The following discussion is not intended to be a complete
analysis or description of all potential United States federal
income tax consequences or any other tax consequences of the
merger. In addition, the discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may vary with a stockholder’s individual
circumstances.

Holders of Packard BioScience common stock are urged to
consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences
to them as a result of the merger, including the applicability
and effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws, and of
changes in applicable tax laws.

The parties have structured the merger so that it is anticipated
that the merger will be a reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Completion of the merger is conditioned on
PerkinElmer’s receipt of an opinion from Hale and Dorr LLP
and Packard BioScience’s receipt of an opinion from
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to the effect that the merger
will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The opinions of Hale and Dorr LLP and
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz will be based on the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in the
opinions, including representations contained in certificates
executed by officers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience. The
opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts will not take a contrary view. No ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be sought.

Assuming the merger is treated for federal income tax purposes
as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the limitations and
qualifications referred to in this discussion, the following tax
consequences will result:

• 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by PerkinElmer or Packard
	BioScience solely as a result of the merger;

• 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Packard
	BioScience common stock upon the receipt of PerkinElmer common
	stock solely in exchange for Packard BioScience common stock in
	the merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of
	fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock;

• 

	Cash payments received by holders of Packard BioScience common
	stock in lieu of fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock
	generally will be treated as capital gain or loss measured by
	the difference between the cash payment received and the portion
	of the tax basis in the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered that is allocable to the fractional share. Any gain
	or loss will



	be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held
	the Packard BioScience common stock for more than one year at
	the effective time of the merger;

• 

	The total tax basis of a Packard BioScience stockholder in the
	PerkinElmer common stock received in exchange for Packard
	BioScience common stock in the merger will be the same as the
	total tax basis of the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered in the exchange, reduced by the amount of any tax
	basis allocable to any fractional share for which cash is
	received; and

• 

	The holding period of the PerkinElmer common stock received by
	each Packard BioScience stockholder in the merger will include
	the holding period for the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered in the exchange if the Packard BioScience common
	stock surrendered is held as a capital asset at the effective
	time of the merger.

A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the
“reorganization” status of the merger would generally
result in a Packard BioScience stockholder recognizing gain or
loss with respect to shares of Packard BioScience common stock
surrendered in the merger equal to the difference between the
Packard BioScience stockholder’s basis in those shares and
the fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger,
of the PerkinElmer common stock received in exchange for those
shares. In the event of a successful challenge, a Packard
BioScience stockholder’s total tax basis in the PerkinElmer
common stock received generally would equal its fair market
value as of the effective time of the merger, and the Packard
BioScience stockholder’s holding period for the stock would
begin the day after the merger.

In connection with the filing of the registration statement of
which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part,
PerkinElmer has received an opinion of Hale and Dorr LLP and
Packard BioScience has received an opinion of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz to the effect that the foregoing discussion
under “Material United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations,” insofar as it describes the United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger, is accurate in
all material respects. Those legal opinions are included as
exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the registration statement.

Resales of PerkinElmer Common Stock Issued in Connection with
the Merger; Affiliate Agreements

PerkinElmer common stock issued in connection with the merger
will be freely transferable, except that shares of PerkinElmer
common stock received by persons who are deemed to be
“affiliates,” as the term is defined by Rule 144
under the Securities Act, of Packard BioScience or become
“affiliates” of PerkinElmer following the effective
time of the merger may be resold by them only in transactions
permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
Act.

No Appraisal Rights

PerkinElmer stockholders and Packard BioScience stockholders are
not entitled to exercise dissenter’s or appraisal rights as
a result of the merger or to demand payment for their shares
under applicable law.

Delisting and Deregistration of Packard BioScience Common
Stock Following the Merger

If the merger is completed, Packard BioScience’s common
stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will
be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.



THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a brief summary of the material provisions
of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference into this summary. While we believe that this summary
covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to
Packard BioScience stockholders and PerkinElmer stockholders. We
urge all Packard BioScience stockholders and PerkinElmer
stockholders to read the merger agreement in its entirety for a
more complete description of the terms and conditions of the
merger and related matters.

General

Following the adoption of the merger agreement by the
stockholders of Packard BioScience, the approval by PerkinElmer
stockholders of the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock to the
stockholders of Packard BioScience and the satisfaction or
waiver of the other conditions to the merger, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PerkinElmer named “Pablo Acquisition
Corp.” will be merged into Packard BioScience. Packard
BioScience will be the surviving entity of the merger and will
then be a wholly-owned subsidiary of PerkinElmer. If all
conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger
will become effective at the time of the filing of a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The Exchange Ratio and Treatment of Packard BioScience Common
Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding
share of Packard BioScience common stock will be converted into
the right to receive 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common
stock. However, shares of Packard BioScience common stock held
in the treasury of Packard BioScience or by any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and shares held by PerkinElmer or any
of its wholly-owned subsidiaries will be canceled without
conversion. The exchange ratio will be adjusted for any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar change with
respect to PerkinElmer common stock or Packard BioScience common
stock, occurring after the date of the merger agreement and
before the effective time.

Based on the exchange ratio of 0.311 and the number of shares of
Packard BioScience common stock outstanding on August 21,
2001, a total of approximately [     ]
shares of PerkinElmer common stock will be issued in the merger.

Treatment of Packard BioScience Stock Options

At the effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will assume
Packard BioScience’s stock option plans (other than its
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which will be terminated) and each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Packard BioScience
common stock, which will then be options to purchase shares of
PerkinElmer common stock. All unexercisable Packard BioScience
stock options will become fully exercisable as a result of the
merger. The number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock
issuable upon the exercise of Packard BioScience stock options
assumed by PerkinElmer in the merger will be adjusted by
multiplying the number of shares of Packard BioScience common
stock subject to the stock option prior to the merger by the
exchange ratio of 0.311. The number of shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options assumed by PerkinElmer in the merger
will be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The exercise price per share under each Packard BioScience stock
option will also be adjusted by dividing the exercise price per
share for the Packard BioScience common stock subject to the
stock option prior to the merger by the exchange ratio of 0.311.
The exercise price of stock options assumed by PerkinElmer in
the merger will be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

PerkinElmer has reserved for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of its common stock for delivery if a Packard BioScience
optionholder exercises its options as described above. After the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the
assumed Packard BioScience stock options. During the period that
any options remain outstanding, PerkinElmer



will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of this registration statement on Form S-8.

Exchange of Certificates

Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; No Further Ownership
Rights.
 As soon as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer’s exchange agent
will mail to each record holder of Packard BioScience common
stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering
their certificates. Only those holders who properly surrender
their certificates in accordance with the instructions will
receive certificates representing shares of PerkinElmer common
stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of PerkinElmer
common stock, and any dividends or distributions to which they
are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares
of Packard BioScience common stock will be canceled.

After the effective time of the merger, under the merger
agreement, each certificate representing shares of Packard
BioScience common stock that has not been surrendered will only
represent the right to receive:

• 

	shares of PerkinElmer common stock;

• 

	cash in lieu of any fractional shares of PerkinElmer common
	stock; and

• 

	any dividends or distributions on shares of PerkinElmer common
	stock after the effective time of the merger.

Following the effective time of the merger, Packard BioScience
will not register any transfers of shares of Packard BioScience
common stock on its stock transfer books.

No Fractional Shares. 
PerkinElmer will not issue any
fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock in the merger.
Instead, each holder of shares of Packard BioScience common
stock converted in connection with the merger who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock will receive cash, without interest, in
an amount equal to the product of the fractional share
multiplied by the weighted average of the per share selling
price of PerkinElmer common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day prior to the effective time of the merger. As of the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will deposit with its
exchange agent the shares of PerkinElmer common stock issuable
in connection with the merger and cash in an amount sufficient
to cover any payment in lieu of fractional shares or any
dividends or distributions.

Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. 
No
dividends or other distributions declared or made on or after
the effective time of the merger with respect to shares of
PerkinElmer common stock will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Packard BioScience certificate with respect to the
shares of PerkinElmer common stock that the holder is entitled
to receive, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
will be paid to the holder until the holder surrenders its
Packard BioScience certificate. Upon surrender of the
certificate, PerkinElmer will pay to the record holder of the
certificate, without interest, any dividends or distributions
with respect to the shares of PerkinElmer common stock which
have a record date on or after the effective time of the merger
and have become payable between the effective time of the merger
and the time of surrender.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. 
If any
certificate representing shares of Packard BioScience common
stock is lost, stolen or destroyed, a Packard BioScience
stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact
to PerkinElmer. PerkinElmer may also require the Packard
BioScience stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against PerkinElmer with respect to
any certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Only upon receipt of the affidavit, and bond, if requested, will
PerkinElmer’s exchange agent issue the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock, any cash payable for fractional
shares, and any dividends or distributions that have become
payable between the effective time of the merger and the time of
surrender.



Holders of Packard BioScience common stock should not send in
their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal
from the exchange agent.

Conduct of PerkinElmer’s Business Prior to the
Merger.
 Except as contemplated by the merger agreement,
PerkinElmer has agreed that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with past practice to maintain its business
organization. In addition, PerkinElmer has agreed that neither
it nor its subsidiaries will:

• 

	make any amendment to its articles of organization that changes
	the fundamental attributes of PerkinElmer common stock;

• 

	make any material changes to the certificate of incorporation of
	Pablo Acquisition Corp.;

• 

	with specified exceptions, make, declare or pay any

• 

	take any action that affects Packard BioScience’s
	stockholders disproportionately and materially adversely as

• 

	take any action that would prevent or impede the merger from
	qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
	section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or

• 

	knowingly take any action or knowingly omit to take any action
	for the purpose of directly or indirectly preventing, materially
	delaying or materially impeding, or that would reasonably be
	expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede, the
	consummation of the merger.

Packard BioScience is Restricted from Trying to Sell to
Another Party.
 Packard BioScience has agreed that until the
effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, whichever



first occurs, it will not and will not cause, authorize or
permit any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or its or their
representatives to, directly or indirectly:

• 

	solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to
	facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
	that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
	any acquisition proposal including approving any transaction, or
	any person becoming an interested stockholder, under the
	business combination with interested stockholder provision of
	Delaware law; or

• 

	enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
	or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information
	with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt
	by any person with respect to or cooperate in any way with any
	acquisition proposal.

Packard BioScience also agreed to cease all discussions and
negotiations that commenced on or before the date the merger
agreement was signed regarding any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition
proposal. Packard BioScience also agreed to notify PerkinElmer
promptly and orally, with written confirmation to follow within
24 hours, of the occurrence of any acquisition proposal or
request for nonpublic information in connection with any
acquisition proposal by any person that Packard BioScience has
knowledge may be considering making or has made, including
specified information regarding the proposal. Packard BioScience
also agreed to keep PerkinElmer informed, on a prompt basis, of
the status of any such acquisition proposal or request.

An “acquisition proposal” is, other than the merger
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

• 

	any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
	sale of substantial assets, tender offer, recapitalization,
	share exchange or other business combination involving Packard
	BioScience and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

• 

	any proposal for the issuance by Packard BioScience or any of
	its subsidiaries of over 20% of its equity securities; or

• 

	any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
	indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated
	total assets of Packard BioScience.

However, in response to an acquisition proposal that did not
result from a breach of the restrictions described above,
Packard BioScience may furnish information with respect to
Packard BioScience to any person or their representative making
an acquisition proposal, and engage in discussions or
negotiations with such person or their representative, pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement at least as materially
restrictive of the other party as the confidentiality agreement
between Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, which need not
contain standstill provisions, that the board of directors of
Packard BioScience determines, in good faith and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal.
A “superior proposal” is any unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially
all of the equity securities or assets of Packard BioScience
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a
consolidation or sale of its assets that is:

• 

	more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
	Packard BioScience common stock than the transactions
	contemplated by the merger agreement, taking into account all
	terms and conditions of the proposal and the merger agreement,
	including any PerkinElmer proposal to amend the agreement, as
	determined by the Packard BioScience board of directors in good
	faith and on the advice of a nationally recognized independent
	financial advisor; and

• 

	reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed,
	taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal or other
	aspects of the proposal.

However, a proposal to acquire less than substantially all but
at least a majority of Packard BioScience’s equity
securities may be a superior proposal as long as the other
provisions of the above definition are satisfied and the Packard
BioScience board of directors determines in its good faith
judgment, based on the advice of a nationally recognized
independent financial advisor, that the value of



the proposal, together with the fair market value of the Packard
BioScience common stock to be retained by Packard BioScience
stockholders, is more favorable from a financial point of view
to stockholders than the merger agreement.

In addition, Packard BioScience is not prohibited from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer or from making other disclosure to its stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Packard BioScience board
of directors, based on advice from outside legal counsel,
failure to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under law.

In addition, Packard BioScience has agreed that neither its
board of directors nor any committee thereof will, until the
effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, whichever first occurs:

• 

	withdraw or propose to withdraw or knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner or propose to knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner, the approval or recommendation of the
	merger agreement or the merger by the board of directors of
	Packard BioScience or any committee thereof;

• 

	cause or permit Packard BioScience to enter into any letter of
	intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
	acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
	constituting or relating to an acquisition proposal, other than
	a permitted confidentiality agreement; or

• 

	adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
	recommend, any acquisition proposal.

However, the board of directors of Packard BioScience or any
committee thereof may withdraw or knowingly modify in a material
adverse manner its approval or recommendation if it:

• 

	determines, in good faith and after consultation with its
	outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that an
	acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal as to which
	it intends to enter into a binding written agreement;

• 

	complies with the notice and other procedural requirements set
	forth in the merger agreement; and

• 

	pays the termination fee upon its termination of the merger
	agreement described below under the caption
	“— Termination; Expenses and Termination
	Fees.”

In addition, the board of directors of Packard BioScience may
adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, a superior proposal if it complies with the notice
and other procedural requirements set forth in the merger
agreement and pays the termination fee upon its termination of
the merger agreement described below under the caption
“—Termination; Expenses and Termination Fees.”

Stockholders Meetings. 
Each of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience has agreed to hold its special meeting of
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part is declared effective, and in any event within 45 days
of effectiveness:

• 

	for Packard BioScience stockholders to consider and vote on the
	adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; and

• 

	for PerkinElmer stockholders to consider and vote upon the
	issuance of the PerkinElmer common stock to Packard BioScience
	stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement.

Subject to the good faith determination by the PerkinElmer board
of directors that it is required to withdraw its recommendation
to comply with its fiduciary duties and to the ability of the
Packard BioScience board of directors to withdraw or knowingly
modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation of the
merger in connection with a superior proposal, each board is
obligated to recommend approval of the actions to be considered
by their respective stockholders. PerkinElmer, as the sole
stockholder of Pablo Acquisition Corp., is obligated to approve
the merger agreement.



Consents; Other Actions. 
PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience have also agreed to use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, directly or
indirectly, in connection with:

• 

	obtaining any governmental consents, licenses, permits or
	waivers necessary to consummate the merger, making all necessary
	filings under any applicable domestic or foreign law, including
	the federal or state securities laws and executing any
	additional instruments necessary to consummate the merger;

• 

	obtaining any governmental clearances or approvals required
	under federal, state or foreign antitrust laws in order to
	consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• 

	defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging
	the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions
	contemplated by the merger agreement; and

• 

	obtaining specified third party consents that are required to
	consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

If required to obtain clearances or approvals of the merger
under federal, state or foreign antitrust laws, PerkinElmer has
agreed to divest assets of PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, or
of any of their subsidiaries, that generated $30 million or less
of the total consolidated sales of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience in fiscal year 2000.

Stock Exchange Listing. 
PerkinElmer has agreed to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock that will be issued in the merger to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Packard BioScience agreed
to use reasonable best efforts to continue the quotation of its
common stock on The Nasdaq National Market during the term of
the merger agreement.

Reorganization. 
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience have
each agreed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause
the merger to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience adopted the merger agreement
as a plan of reorganization.

Employee Matters. 
The surviving company in the merger has
agreed to honor all Packard BioScience employee plans, other
than its employee stock purchase plan, subject to any amendment
or termination permitted by such plans.

In addition, PerkinElmer has agreed to:

• 

	provide compensation, including employee benefits, to Packard
	BioScience’s U.S.  employees that is, in the
	aggregate, not materially less favorable than the compensation
	PerkinElmer provides to its similarly situated
	U.S. employees; and

• 

	provide compensation, including employee benefits, to Packard
	BioScience’s non-U.S. employees that is, in the
	aggregate, not materially less favorable than the compensation
	PerkinElmer provides to its similarly situated
	non-U.S. employees or the compensation that Packard
	BioScience provides them prior to the merger.

PerkinElmer has agreed that certain Packard BioScience
executives will have “good reason” to terminate
employment upon consummation of the merger and receive maximum
severance. See the section entitled “The Merger —
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.” Packard
BioScience’s employee stock purchase plan will terminate
immediately prior to consummation of the merger, and
participants in the plan will then be entitled to exercise their
options for the final plan cycle to purchase shares of Packard
BioScience common stock.

Appointment to PerkinElmer Board of Directors. 
At the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will appoint
Alexis P. Michas, as a designee of Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., to the PerkinElmer board of
directors. See the section entitled “Related
Agreements — Stockholder and Voting Agreements.”



Director and Officer Indemnification. 
PerkinElmer has
agreed that, for a period of six years following the effective
time of the merger, PerkinElmer will indemnify the present and
former directors and officers of Packard BioScience to the
extent that such obligation exists under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Packard BioScience as of the date of
the merger agreement. PerkinElmer has also agreed to cause
Packard BioScience, for six years after the merger, to maintain
in effect, with specified exceptions, a directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy covering those persons
who were covered by the directors’ and officers’
liability insurance policy of Packard BioScience on
July 13, 2001, with coverage in amount and scope at least
as favorable to such persons as the current coverage provided by
Packard BioScience, provided that PerkinElmer will not be
required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by Packard BioScience for such coverage.

Notification. 
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience have
agreed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to give
reasonably prompt notice to one another of any event that would
be likely to result in a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in the merger agreement or the failure of any
covenant, condition or agreement in the merger agreement to be
complied with.

Termination; Expenses and Termination Fees

Termination

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned
at any time prior to the effective time of the merger by mutual
written consent. In addition, either PerkinElmer or Packard
BioScience may terminate the merger agreement upon written
notice to the other party at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger under the following circumstances:

• 

	if the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001, or
	February 15, 2002 in the event the consummation of the
	merger is delayed due to the need to obtain antitrust related
	governmental approvals and consents;

• 

	if any governmental order, decree, ruling or action permanently
	restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger shall
	become final and non-appealable;

• 

	if the Packard BioScience stockholders do not adopt the merger
	agreement at a meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders
	convened for that purpose; or

• 

	if the PerkinElmer stockholders do not approve the issuance of
	the PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger at a
	meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders convened for that purpose.

In addition, Packard BioScience can terminate the merger
agreement upon written notice to PerkinElmer if:

• 

	PerkinElmer or Pablo Acquisition Corp. breaches or fails to
	perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
	which breach or failure to perform would cause the closing
	conditions relating to the accuracy of PerkinElmer’s
	representations and warranties and performance of
	PerkinElmer’s covenants not to be satisfied and is not
	cured by PerkinElmer within 30 days of receiving written
	notice of the breach;

• 

	the PerkinElmer board of directors or a committee of the board
	of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in a material
	adverse manner its recommendation that the PerkinElmer
	stockholders approve the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in
	connection with the merger or fails to reconfirm its
	recommendation within five days (which may be extended by five
	additional days under certain circumstances) after Packard
	BioScience requests it to do so; or



• 

	the Packard BioScience board of directors, or a committee
	thereof, before the meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders
	to consider the merger, provides written notice to PerkinElmer
	of its bona fide intention to enter in a binding written
	agreement for a superior proposal, provided that
	(1) Packard BioScience complied with its obligations not to
	solicit other acquisition proposals, as described under
	“— Covenants of PerkinElmer and Packard
	BioScience — Packard BioScience is Restricted from
	Trying to Sell to Another Party”, (2) Packard
	BioScience notifies PerkinElmer in writing of the superior
	proposal, including the material terms and conditions,
	(3) PerkinElmer does not make an offer that is as
	favorable, as determined by the Packard BioScience board of
	directors in good faith and in consultation with its outside
	legal counsel and financial advisor, as the superior proposal
	within two business days of being notified of the superior
	proposal and (4) Packard BioScience pays the termination
	fee described below.

In addition, PerkinElmer can terminate the merger agreement upon
written notice if:

• 

	Packard BioScience breaches or fails to perform any
	representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, which breach or
	failure to perform would cause the closing conditions relating
	to the accuracy of Packard BioScience’s representations and
	warranties and performance of Packard BioScience’s
	covenants not to be satisfied and is not cured by Packard
	BioScience within 30 days of receiving written notice of
	the breach;

• 

	the Packard BioScience board of directors or a committee of the
	board of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in a material
	adverse manner its recommendation that the Packard BioScience
	stockholders adopt the merger agreement or fails to reconfirm
	its recommendation within five days (which may be extended by
	five days under certain circumstances) after PerkinElmer
	requests it to do so; or

• 

	a third party, other than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates,
	becomes the beneficial owner of at least a majority of the
	outstanding shares of Packard BioScience Common Stock.

If either PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience terminates the
merger agreement because of any of the reasons above, all
obligations of the parties under the merger agreement will
terminate, except some provisions, including the obligation to
pay fees and expenses incurred by either party in connection
with the merger and the requirements under a confidentiality
agreement. However, no termination shall relieve PerkinElmer or
Packard BioScience from liability or damages resulting from
willful breach of the merger agreement.

Expenses

Generally, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will bear their
own expenses incurred in connection with the merger. However,
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will share equally the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with preparing, filing and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus, other than
accountants’ and attorneys’ fees, and the filing fee
of PerkinElmer’s pre-merger notification report.

Packard BioScience has agreed to pay up to $1,500,000 to
PerkinElmer as reimbursement for PerkinElmer’s fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the merger upon termination:

• 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, because the merger is not
	completed by December 31, 2001, or February 15, 2002
	in the event the consummation of the merger is delayed due to
	the need to obtain antitrust related governmental approvals and
	consents, provided the meeting of the Packard BioScience
	stockholders convened for the purpose of adopting the merger
	agreement has not occurred and a third party has publicly
	announced an acquisition proposal with respect to Packard
	BioScience that remains outstanding at the time of termination;
	or

• 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, if the Packard BioScience
	stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at a meeting of
	Packard BioScience stockholders convened for that purpose.

However, if Packard BioScience has to pay a termination fee, as
described below, the termination fee can be reduced by any
amount of expenses that Packard BioScience previously reimbursed
PerkinElmer.



PerkinElmer has agreed to pay up to $1,500,000 to Packard
BioScience as reimbursement for Packard BioScience’s fees
and expenses paid in connection with the merger upon termination
by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, if the PerkinElmer
stockholders do not approve the issuance of PerkinElmer common
stock in connection with the merger at a meeting of PerkinElmer
stockholders convened for that purpose.

Termination Fees

Packard BioScience must pay PerkinElmer a termination fee of
$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement:

• 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience because the merger is not
	completed by December 31, 2001, or February 15, 2002
	in the event the consummation of the merger is delayed due to
	the need to obtain antitrust related governmental approvals and
	consents, provided the meeting of the Packard BioScience
	stockholders convened for the purpose of adopting the merger
	agreement has not occurred, if a third party has publicly
	announced an acquisition proposal to acquire Packard BioScience
	after the date of the merger agreement, but before the
	termination of the merger agreement, that remains outstanding
	and Packard BioScience enters into a definitive agreement with
	respect to an acquisition proposal, or an acquisition proposal
	relating to Packard BioScience is consummated with, a third
	party, other than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates, within
	12 months of the termination, provided that for the purpose
	of this determination only, all references to 20% in the
	definition of acquisition proposal are changed to 25%;

• 

	by PerkinElmer because a third party, other than PerkinElmer or
	any of its affiliates, becomes the beneficial owner of at least
	a majority of the outstanding shares of Packard BioScience
	Common Stock;

• 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience because the Packard
	BioScience stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at a
	meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders convened for that
	purpose, if a third party has publicly announced an acquisition
	proposal to acquire Packard BioScience after the date of the
	merger agreement, but before the termination of the merger
	agreement, that remains outstanding and Packard BioScience
	enters into a definitive agreement to be acquired by, or an
	acquisition proposal is consummated with, a third party, other
	than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates, within 12 months
	of the termination, provided that for the purpose of this
	determination only, all references to 20% in the definition of
	acquisition proposal are changed to 25%;

• 

	by PerkinElmer because of Packard BioScience’s failure to
	satisfy the closing condition relating to the accuracy of its
	representations and warranties based on a breach of a
	representation or warranty that Packard BioScience knew was
	false when it was made, or because of Packard BioScience’s
	failure to satisfy the closing condition relating to the
	performance of its covenants based on a material and knowing
	breach by Packard BioScience of its obligations in the merger
	agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to closing;

• 

	by PerkinElmer because the Packard BioScience board of directors
	or committee of the board of directors withdraws or knowingly
	modifies in a material adverse manner its recommendation that
	the Packard BioScience stockholders adopt the merger agreement
	or fails to reconfirm its recommendation within five days (which
	may be extended by five days under certain circumstances) after
	PerkinElmer requests to do so; or

• 

	by Packard BioScience because Packard BioScience, before the
	meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders to consider the
	merger, provides written notice to PerkinElmer of its bona fide
	intention to enter in a binding written agreement for a superior
	proposal, provided that (1) Packard BioScience complied
	with its obligations not to solicit other acquisition proposals,
	as described under “— Covenants of PerkinElmer
	and Packard BioScience — Packard BioScience is
	Restricted from Trying to Sell to Another Party,”
	(2) Packard BioScience notifies PerkinElmer in writing of
	the superior proposal, including the material terms and
	conditions, (3) PerkinElmer does not make an offer
	that is as favorable to the superior proposal within two
	business days of being notified of



	the superior proposal and (4) Packard BioScience
	concurrently with the termination pays the termination fee.

PerkinElmer must pay Packard BioScience a termination fee of
$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement:

• 

	by Packard BioScience because the PerkinElmer board of directors
	withdraws or knowingly modifies in a material adverse manner its
	recommendation that the PerkinElmer stockholders approve the
	issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the
	merger or fails to reconfirm its recommendation within five days
	(which may be extended by five days under certain circumstances)
	after Packard BioScience requests to do so; or

• 

	by Packard BioScience because of PerkinElmer’s failure to
	satisfy the closing condition relating to the accuracy of its
	representations and warranties based on a breach of a
	representation or warranty that PerkinElmer knew was false when
	it was made, or because of PerkinElmer’s failure to satisfy
	the closing condition relating to the performance of its
	covenants based on a material and knowing breach by PerkinElmer
	of its obligations in the merger agreement required to be
	performed by it on or prior to closing.

Amendment

Generally, the board of directors of each of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience may amend the merger agreement at any time
prior to the effective time. Amendments must be in writing and
signed by all parties.



RELATED AGREEMENTS

Stockholder and Voting Agreements

As an inducement to PerkinElmer to enter into the merger
agreement, on July 13, 2001, Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. entered into a stockholder’s
agreement with PerkinElmer. As of August 21, 2001, the
record date for the special meeting of Packard BioScience
stockholders, Stonington owned 30,898,890 shares of Packard
BioScience common stock and had the right to direct the vote
with respect to an additional 1,123,590 shares of Packard
BioScience common stock. Together, these shares represented
     % of the outstanding Packard
BioScience common stock on the record date for the special
meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders. Pursuant to the
stockholder’s agreement, Stonington agreed to vote the
shares that it owns or acquires, and to direct the vote with
respect to the shares over which it has or acquires the power to
direct the vote, in favor of the merger agreement and against
“opposing proposals”. In addition, Stonington
irrevocably appointed PerkinElmer as its proxy to vote the
shares it owns. Accordingly, Stonington has agreed not to
transfer any of the shares that it owns and not to consent to
the transfer of the shares over which it has the power to direct
the vote. Stonington’s obligations to vote or direct the
vote and not to transfer or consent to the transfer of these
shares automatically terminate if the Packard BioScience board
of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in an adverse
manner its recommendation of the merger proposal, termination of
the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or
consummation of the merger agreement, whichever is earliest.

The stockholder’s agreement also provides Stonington with
the following additional rights:

• 

	PerkinElmer has agreed to register for resale under the
	Securities Act of 1933 the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to
	be received by Stonington in the merger as promptly as
	practicable, but not later than 30  days, following the
	effective time of the merger. Stonington may also include these
	shares in other registration statements that PerkinElmer may
	file in the future, subject to specific exceptions. The
	registration rights will terminate if Stonington ceases to
	beneficially own at least 5% of the outstanding shares of
	PerkinElmer common stock or at such time as Stonington is able
	to sell the shares of PerkinElmer common stock it receives in
	the merger without any restrictions under Rule 145 under
	the Securities Act, whichever occurs first; and

• 

	Stonington has the right to designate one person to be nominated
	as a director as of the effective time of the merger and at each
	annual meeting of stockholders of PerkinElmer following the
	effective time of the merger. Stonington’s initial designee
	to PerkinElmer’s board of directors upon the effectiveness
	of the merger is Alexis P. Michas. This right will terminate if
	Stonington ceases to beneficially own 5% or more of the
	outstanding shares of PerkinElmer common stock.

Stonington also agreed that, following the effective time of the
merger, it will not transfer more than 5% of the outstanding
shares of PerkinElmer common stock in any 90-day period, except
for sales in an underwritten offering permitted by the
stockholder’s agreement.

The stockholder’s agreement is attached as Annex D to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

As an inducement to PerkinElmer to enter into the merger
agreement, on July 13, 2001, Richard T. McKernan, Virginia
J. McKernan, Barbara P. Olcott, Emery G. Olcott, the
Timothy S. Olcott Trust, Timothy O. White, Jr. and Franklin R.
Witney each entered into separate voting agreements with
PerkinElmer. Pursuant to these agreements, these Packard
BioScience stockholders agreed to vote in favor of the merger
agreement and against “opposing proposals” and, as of
August 21, 2001, not to transfer a total of 2,368,975
shares. However, a stockholder may transfer some or all of his
or her shares so long as, after giving effect to the transfer,
the number of shares subject to these voting agreements and held
by these Packard BioScience stockholders is at least a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Packard BioScience common
stock. The shares subject to the voting agreements represented
     % of the outstanding shares of
Packard BioScience common stock on August 21, 2001, the
record date for the special meeting of Packard BioScience
stockholders. Each person also irrevocably appointed PerkinElmer
as his or her proxy, to vote his or her shares accordingly. The
obligations to vote and not to transfer their shares and proxies
automatically terminate if the Packard BioScience board of
directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in an adverse manner
its recommendation of the merger in response to a superior



proposal, termination of the merger agreement in accordance with
its terms or consummation of the merger agreement, whichever is
earliest. The form of voting agreement is attached as Annex E to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Employment Agreements

In connection with the merger, PerkinElmer and Franklin R.
Witney entered into a new employment agreement as described
under the section entitled “The Merger —
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.”



UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial
information reflects PerkinElmer’s proposed acquisition of
Packard BioScience pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger
dated as of July 13, 2001. Packard BioScience is a global
developer, manufacturer and marketer of instruments and related
consumables and services for use in drug discovery and other
life sciences research, such as basic human disease research and
biotechnology. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
financial information also reflects the annual results of
operations of NEN, which PerkinElmer acquired in fiscal year
2000, and GSI Lumonics, Inc., referred to as GSLI, which Packard
BioScience acquired in fiscal year 2000, for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmer’s financials prospectively as of the completion
of the merger.

The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information
gives effect to the acquisitions of Packard BioScience and NEN
as of the beginning of the periods presented and should be read
in conjunction with the historical financial statements and
related notes thereto for PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and
NEN. The financial statements required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the NEN acquisition were
included as exhibits in a separate Report on Form 8-K,
filed by PerkinElmer on August 1, 2000. The unaudited pro
forma combined financial information for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000, as reclassified in PerkinElmer’s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 3, 2001,
and the six month period ended July 1, 2001, gives effect
to the acquisitions as if they were completed as of
January 3, 2000, and combine PerkinElmer, Packard
BioScience and NEN’s historical statements of operations
for each respective period as necessary. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial information for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 excludes an acquisition-related charge of
$24.3 million for acquired in-process research and
development related to NEN. Additionally, this pro forma
financial information excludes an estimated acquisition-related
charge of $66.8 million for acquired in-process research
and development related to the proposed acquisition of Packard
BioScience. PerkinElmer has not yet finalized an appraisal of
the Packard BioScience in-process research and development
charge and accordingly, the final amount may differ from this
estimate.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 includes columns
representing: (1) PerkinElmer’s historical results as
reclassified for the planned divestiture of its Security and
Detection Systems business for the twelve months then ended,
(2) NEN’s historical results for the period from
January 1 through July 31, 2000, the date of the NEN
acquisition by PerkinElmer, (3) Packard BioScience’s
historical results for the fiscal twelve months ended
December 31, 2000, and (4) GSLI’s historical
results for the period from January 1 through September 30,
2000, the date of the GSLI acquisition by Packard BioScience.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the
six months ended July 1, 2001 includes columns representing
PerkinElmer’s historical results as reclassified for the
planned divestiture of its Security and Detection Systems
business and the incorporation of Packard BioScience’s
historical results for the period from January 1, 2001
through June 30, 2001.

The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of
July 1, 2001 includes the historical balance sheet of
PerkinElmer as reclassified for the planned divestiture of its
Security and Detection Systems business as of July 1, 2001
and gives effect to the proposed acquisition of Packard
BioScience as if it occurred on July 1, 2001.



The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is
provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of PerkinElmer’s operating results that would
have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on the
dates, or at the beginning of the period, for which the
consummation of the acquisitions is being given effect, nor is
it necessarily indicative of PerkinElmer’s future operating
results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments do not reflect any
operating efficiencies and cost savings that PerkinElmer
believes are achievable.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been
prepared using the purchase method of accounting, whereby the
total cost of the acquisitions has been allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values at the effective date of
each acquisition. For the Packard BioScience acquisition, such
allocations will be based on studies and independent valuations,
which are currently being conducted. Accordingly, the
allocations reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information are preliminary and subject to revision.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

Note 1 — Presentation

On July 16, 2001, PerkinElmer announced its intention to
sell its Security and Detection Systems business. Accordingly,
the results of operations of the Security and Detection Systems
business have been excluded from PerkinElmer’s historical
results from continuing operations and it is reflected as net
assets from discontinued operations in the accompanying
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet.

Note 2 — Purchase Price Allocation

The purchase price allocation related to the NEN acquisition is
included in PerkinElmer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and its Current Report
filed on Form 8-K, filed August 1, 2000, related to
the NEN acquisition.

The aggregate purchase price to be paid for Packard BioScience
is estimated at $761 million, including acquisition costs, based
upon the average of the closing prices of PerkinElmer common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the five day period
ended July 17, 2001. In connection with this acquisition,
PerkinElmer agreed to issue 0.311 shares of PerkinElmer common
stock for each outstanding share of Packard BioScience common
stock. PerkinElmer also agreed to assume all outstanding options
to purchase Packard BioScience common stock, which options will
become exercisable for shares of PerkinElmer common stock
following the merger after giving effect to the same exchange
ratio as offered to the Packard BioScience common stockholders.
The purchase price for Packard BioScience has been allocated to
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. The preliminary purchase price allocation is based on
PerkinElmer’s current estimates of respective fair values.
Some allocations will be based on studies and independent
valuations that are currently being conducted. The components of
the estimated purchase price and preliminary allocation are as

PerkinElmer’s management is in the process of finalizing
its integration plans related to Packard BioScience and
accordingly, the amounts recorded are based on
PerkinElmer’s current estimate of those costs.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION — (Continued)

Approximately $66.8 million was allocated to in-process research
and development for projects that are not expected to reach
technological feasibility as of the closing date of the
acquisition, and for which no alternative use exists. The
estimated fair value is based on risk-adjusted cash flows as
determined by an independent third party appraiser. The acquired
in-process research and development charge has not been included
in the pro forma combined statements of operations due to its
nonrecurring nature.

Note (A)

Adjustments relate to the write-up to fair value of the Packard
BioScience work-in-process and finished goods inventory as of
its deemed acquisition date which totaled $2.5 million. This
amount is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is
sold and has been included in cost of sales in the pro forma
combined statement of operations through a pro forma adjustment
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

Note (B)

The acquired identifiable intangible assets of Packard
BioScience and NEN include the fair value assigned to
trademarks, trade names, patents and developed technology by an
independent third party appraiser. These intangible assets are
being amortized over periods of 10-40 years for NEN and
7-15 years for Packard BioScience. The pro forma adjustments to
the combined statements of operations include amortization
expense related to the Packard BioScience identifiable
intangible assets of (1) $13.6 million relating to cost of
sales and $3.5 million relating to selling, general and
administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 and (2) $6.8 million relating to
cost of sales and $1.8 million relating to selling, general and
administrative expenses for the six months ended July 1,
2001, respectively. The pro forma adjustments to the combined
statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 includes incremental amortization expense
over the historical amounts related to the NEN identifiable
intangible assets of $642,000 for selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the
fair value of net assets acquired and totaled (1) $444
million with respect to the acquisition of Packard Bioscience,
(2) $271 million with respect to the acquisition of NEN,
and (3) $90 million with respect to GSLI, a company
acquired by Packard BioScience. The Packard BioScience goodwill
will not be amortized, as discussed below, and is therefore not
reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the combined statements
of operations for either period presented. The pro forma
adjustments to the combined statement of operations for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 include incremental
amortization expense over historical amounts related to the NEN
and GSLI goodwill of $7.9 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of NEN and GSLI as purchases and
properly reflects the appropriate accounting methods for all
intangible assets under the accounting rules that were in
existence prior to June 30, 2001.

Effective June 30, 2001 the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,
Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, Goodwill and other
Intangible Assets. These statements require the use of the
purchase method of accounting and the allocation of the purchase
price to assets and liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values. They define the criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and
eliminate the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 are
effective for any business combination that is initiated after
June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro
forma combined statement of operations do not reflect any
amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite
lives that will result from PerkinElmer’s proposed
acquisition of Packard BioScience.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION — (Continued)

Note (C)

Adjustments relate to the write-up to fair value of Packard
BioScience and NEN property, plant and equipment as of their
respective deemed acquisition dates which totaled $4.0 million
and $3.0 million, respectively, and the resulting additional
depreciation expense. The pro forma adjustments to the combined
statements of operations include additional depreciation expense
related to the Packard BioScience write-up of: (1) $170,000
relating to cost of sales and $73,000 relating to selling,
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 and (2) $85,000 relating to cost of
sales and $36,000 relating to selling, general and
administrative expenses for the six months ended July 1,
2001. The pro forma adjustments to the combined statement of
operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000
include incremental depreciation expense over the historical
amounts included in this statement of operations related to the
NEN write-up of $137,000 for cost of sales and $59,000 for
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note (D)

Reflects incremental interest expense related to financing the
acquisitions of NEN and GSLI.

PerkinElmer originally financed the NEN acquisition with
commercial paper borrowings and later refinanced it with
$410 million of zero coupon senior convertible debentures,
which were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%. In
connection with completing this debt offering, PerkinElmer
incurred issuance costs of $12 million, which are being
amortized to interest expense over three years.

Packard BioScience financed the acquisition of GSLI with
approximately $40 million of borrowings. Therefore,
$2.1 million of interest expense has been included as a pro
forma adjustment. A one-eighth of one percent change in the base
rate would change annual pro forma interest expense by
approximately $50,000.

Note (E)

Reflects adjustment to eliminate an unrealized loss related to a
warrant of $12.7 million from NEN’s historical
statement of operations for fiscal 2000. The unrealized loss is
a result of NEN’s early adoption of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As
of December 31, 2000, PerkinElmer had not yet adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 and therefore, this amount has
been eliminated through a pro forma adjustment. On
January 1, 2001, PerkinElmer adopted SFAS No. 133 and
determined the effect of this adoption did not have a material
effect on its results of operations or financial position due to
its relatively limited use of derivatives.

Note (F)

Reflects adjustments to eliminate the historical equity accounts
of Packard BioScience and issuance of common stock and options
in connection with the acquisition. Additionally, the in-process
research and development charge of $66.8 million is
reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. This amount will
be expensed as a non-recurring, non-tax deductible charge upon
the consummation of the acquisition. The acquired in-process
research and development charge has not been included in the pro
forma combined statement of operations due to its nonrecurring
nature.

Note (G)

Reflects adjustments to eliminate in-process research and
development charges related to: (1) PerkinElmer’s
acquisition of NEN -$24.3 million, (2) NEN’s
acquisition of Receptor Biology — $1.0 million and
(3) Packard BioScience’s acquisition of GSLI
- -$12.1 million from the historical financial statements of
PerkinElmer, NEN and Packard BioScience for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000. Also reflects an adjustment to
eliminate non-recurring in-process research and development
charges related

INFORMATION — (Continued)

to other PerkinElmer transactions ($2.5 million) from the
historical financial statements of PerkinElmer for the six
months ended July 1, 2001.

Note (H)

Includes adjustments to accrue transaction costs, record the
deferred tax effect resulting from purchase accounting and
reflect the fair value of accrued liabilities as of the
transaction date.

Note (I)

Includes adjustment to record the accrued integration charges as
discussed in Note 2.

Note (J)

Income tax adjustments have been calculated using estimated
statutory income tax rates for the jurisdictions in which the
companies operate. The pro forma consolidated provision for
income taxes may not represent amounts that would have resulted
had PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience (including GSLI) and NEN
filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods
presented.

Note (K)

Includes PerkinElmer shares to be issued in connection with the
Packard BioScience acquisition.



COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

General

The PerkinElmer charter and by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute and other Massachusetts laws related to
corporations currently govern the rights of the holders of
PerkinElmer common stock. The Packard BioScience charter and
by-laws, the Delaware corporation statute and other Delaware
laws related to corporations currently govern the rights of
Packard BioScience stockholders. As a result of the merger,
Packard BioScience stockholders will become holders of
PerkinElmer’s common stock and the rights of the former
Packard BioScience stockholders will thereafter be governed by
PerkinElmer’s charter and by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute and other Massachusetts laws related to
corporations.

The following summary sets forth certain differences between the
Massachusetts corporation statute and the Delaware corporation
statute, between the PerkinElmer charter and the Packard
BioScience charter and between the PerkinElmer by-laws and the
Packard BioScience by-laws. Packard BioScience stockholders are
encouraged to review the full text of each of the PerkinElmer
charter, the PerkinElmer by-laws, the Packard BioScience
charter, the Packard BioScience by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute, the Delaware corporation statute and other
corporation-related laws of Massachusetts and Delaware to the
extent they relate to corporations organized in such states. The
PerkinElmer charter and the PerkinElmer by-laws have been filed
as exhibits to the material filed by PerkinElmer with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. For information as to how
documents may be obtained, see “Where You Can Find More
Information.”

Capitalization

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmer is authorized to issue
300,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 70,000 shares have been designated
Series C junior participating preferred stock. On
August 21, 2001,
          shares
 of PerkinElmer common stock were issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
PerkinElmer’s board has the authority, without stockholder
approval, to issue shares of authorized but undesignated
preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to
fix the rights, preferences and other terms, including voting
rights, of each series of preferred stock, which rights,
preferences and other terms may be superior to that of the
PerkinElmer common stock.

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioScience is authorized to
issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. On August 21, 2001,
               shares
 of Packard BioScience common stock were issued and outstanding
and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
Packard BioScience’s board has the authority, without
stockholder approval, to issue shares of authorized preferred
stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the
rights and preferences, including voting rights, of each series
of preferred stock, which rights, preferences and other terms
may be superior to that of the Packard BioScience common stock.

Classes of Stock

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmer’s common stock is currently
its only outstanding class of stock, each share of which
participates equally in dividends and distributions upon
dissolution of the corporation. Under Massachusetts law and the
PerkinElmer charter, PerkinElmer’s directors may determine
the preferences, voting powers, qualifications, and special or
relative rights or privileges of any class of stock before the
issuance of any share of that class. For a more complete
description of PerkinElmer’s capital stock, please see the
section entitled “Description of PerkinElmer Capital
Stock.”

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law also allows the
directors of a Delaware corporation to determine the voting
powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of a class of stock if the
certificate of corporation so provides. The Packard BioScience
charter permits the board of directors to make such a
designation for preferred stock. This preferred stock may have
dividend and distribution rights superior to those of the
Packard BioScience common stock.



Dividends and Repurchases

PerkinElmer.
 Except with regard to a distribution of
stock of the corporation, Massachusetts law provides that the
directors of a corporation voting in favor of a distribution to
stockholders will be jointly and severally liable if the
distribution (1) is made when the corporation is insolvent,
(2) renders the corporation insolvent or (3) violates
the corporation’s charter. Stockholders to whom a
corporation makes any distribution, except a distribution of
stock of the corporation, may be liable to the corporation for
all or part of such distribution if such distribution is made
while the corporation is insolvent or renders the corporation
insolvent.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that the
directors of a corporation will be jointly and severally liable,
to the full amount unlawfully paid with interest, to the
corporation and its creditors in the event of a dissolution or
insolvency if they willfully or negligently pay a dividend that
is not out of the corporation’s surplus or net profits in
the fiscal year the dividend is paid or purchase or redeem stock
so that the corporation’s capital is impaired, other than
in certain repurchases or redemptions of stock that have
preferences over another class or series of stock.

Voting Requirements and Quorums for Stockholders Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 Each holder of PerkinElmer common stock is
entitled to one vote for each share and may not cumulate votes
for the election of directors. Each holder of PerkinElmer
Series C junior participating preferred stock is entitled
to 1,000 votes for each share on all matters voted on by the
holders of PerkinElmer common stock. The PerkinElmer by-laws
provide, in accordance with Massachusetts law, that the holders
of a majority of each class of the shares of the corporation
then issued, outstanding and entitled to vote constitute a
quorum, and that when a quorum is present any matter properly
brought before a stockholders meeting generally requires, and
may be effected by, a majority stockholder vote. However, any
election of directors by stockholders requires a plurality of
votes and any proposal to merge or consolidate with another
corporation requires a two-thirds vote.

Packard BioScience.
 Each holder of Packard BioScience
common stock is entitled to one vote for each share and may not
cumulate votes for the election of directors. The Packard
BioScience charter and by-laws provide, in accordance with
Delaware law, that the holders of a majority of the shares of
the corporation then issued, outstanding and entitled to vote
constitute a quorum, and that, when a quorum is present, a
majority vote is required to effect any matter, except as
provided in the section below entitled
“— Approval of Business Combinations and Asset
Sales” and except that any election of directors by
stockholders requires a plurality vote.

Cumulative Voting

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law does not authorize or
provide for cumulative voting rights by stockholders in the
election of directors (i.e., each stockholder casts as many
votes for all or any of the directors as he has shares of stock
multiplied by the number of directors to be elected). Neither
the PerkinElmer charter nor the PerkinElmer by-laws provide for
cumulative voting.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, a corporation may
provide in its charter for cumulative voting. Neither the
Packard BioScience charter nor the Packard BioScience by-laws
provide for cumulative voting.

Annual Meeting of Stockholders

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law, the notice of a
corporation’s annual meeting must state the purpose of the
meeting. The PerkinElmer by-laws allow the board of directors or
the chairman of the board to determine the matters to be
addressed at the annual meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 Although Delaware law does not
require the purpose of the annual meeting to be included in the
notice of the annual meeting, the Packard BioScience by-laws
require the purpose of



the annual meeting to be stated in the notice. Delaware law
provides that directors shall be elected at the annual meeting
and any other proper business may be transacted.

Special Meetings of Stockholders

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called by the president, by the PerkinElmer
board or upon written application of stockholders who hold at
least 40% of the capital stock of PerkinElmer entitled to vote
at the proposed meeting. Upon the written application of
stockholders who hold at least 40% of the capital stock of
PerkinElmer entitled to vote, a special meeting must be called
by PerkinElmer’s clerk.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law allows special meetings
of a corporation’s stockholders to be called by its board
of directors or by any person so authorized in the
corporation’s charter or by-laws. Delaware law provides
that the purpose of the special meeting must be included in the
notice of the special meeting. The Packard BioScience by-laws
provide that a special meeting of the stockholders may be called
only by the chairman of the board or by the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total
number of directors.

Notice of Stockholder Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide that notice of stockholder meetings
be given at least seven days before the meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 The Packard BioScience by-laws
require that nominations of persons for election to the board of
directors and the proposal of business to be considered at an
annual meeting of stockholders must be made:

• 

	pursuant to the notice of meeting;

• 

	by or at the direction of the board of directors; or

• 

	by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of
	notice and complies with the notice procedures summarized in the
	next paragraph.

For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
a stockholders meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must
have given timely notice in writing to the secretary of Packard
BioScience and such other business must otherwise be a proper
matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a
stockholder’s notice must be delivered to the secretary at
the principal executive offices of Packard BioScience not later
than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the
close of business on the 120th day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. If the
date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or
more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice must
be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th
day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of
business or the later of the 90th day prior to the annual
meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.

Advance Notice Provisions for Board Nomination and Other
Stockholders Business — Special Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmer’s by-laws do not contain
any advance notice provisions for board nomination or other
stockholder business at a special meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 Stockholder notice must be delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
a special meeting of stockholders and not later than the close
of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special
meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting
and the proposed nominees to the board of directors.



Action by Written Consent in Lieu of a Stockholders’
Meeting

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmer’s by-laws provide that any
action by stockholders may be taken without a meeting and by
written consent if all the stockholders entitled to vote on the
matter consent. Under Massachusetts law, any action to be taken
by stockholders may be taken without a meeting only by unanimous
written consent and a corporation may not provide otherwise in
its articles of organization or by-laws. Accordingly, action by
written consent of the stockholders of PerkinElmer is
effectively prohibited.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, stockholders may
take action by written consent in lieu of voting at a
stockholders meeting unless prohibited by the certificate of
incorporation. Packard BioScience’s certificate of
incorporation does not prohibit action by written consent. In
addition, Packard BioScience’s by-laws provide that any
action by stockholders may be taken without a meeting and by
written consent. Therefore, stockholders of Packard BioScience
may act by written consent.

Classification of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law requires that, unless a
publicly traded corporation chooses otherwise, its board of
directors will be divided into classes, and that the term of
directors on a classified board cannot exceed five years.
PerkinElmer has chosen in its by-laws to have only one class of
directors, with each director to serve until the first annual
meeting following the annual meeting at which the director was
elected. However, Massachusetts law permits PerkinElmer’s
board to opt in to this provision to have a classified board at
any time.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law permits, but does not
require, a board of directors to be divided into classes with
each class having a term of office longer than one year. The
Packard BioScience by-laws provide for one class of directors,
with each director to serve one year, until his or her successor
has been elected and qualified.

Inspection Rights

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law, a
corporation’s stockholders are entitled to inspect and copy
its charter, by-laws, records of stockholders meetings, and
stock and transfer records. These documents must be kept either
at the corporation’s principal office, the transfer
agent’s office, or at the office of the corporation’s
clerk or resident agent. If access to these documents is
refused, the corporation will be liable to the requesting
stockholder for any actual damages which result from such
refusal. However, the corporation is not obligated to produce
such documents if the inspection is being sought to secure a
list of stockholders or other information to be sold or used for
a purpose unrelated to such person’s interest as a
stockholder.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law entitles any stockholder
of record of a corporation, in person or by an agent, upon
written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, to
inspect during usual business hours, for any proper purpose, the
corporation’s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and
its other books and records, and to make copies or extracts
therefrom. A proper purpose means a purpose reasonably related
to such person’s interest as a stockholder.

Removal of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 The PerkinElmer by-laws provide that any
director may be removed, with or without cause, by a two-thirds
stockholder vote, except that directors of a class elected by a
particular class of stockholders may be removed only a by
two-thirds vote of such stockholders. In addition, the
PerkinElmer by-laws also permit the removal of a director with
cause by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office.
The PerkinElmer by-laws also provide that a director may be
removed for cause by the directors or the stockholders only
after providing the director with reasonable notice and an
opportunity to be heard by the body proposing such removal.



Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that a director
serving on a board that is not classified may be removed with or
without cause by a majority of the shares entitled to vote.
Packard BioScience’s by-laws provide that directors may be
removed only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the
holders at least 80% of the combined voting power of the
outstanding shares of Packard BioScience’s voting stock,
voting as a single class.

Change in Number of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law provides that the number
of directors shall be set in a corporation’s by-laws, but
shall not be less than three. In accordance with Massachusetts
law, the PerkinElmer by-laws allow the stockholders or a
majority of the directors to increase the number of directors to
a number greater than three but in no event more than 13.
PerkinElmer currently has nine directors.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that the number
of directors may be fixed in a corporation’s by-laws unless
it is fixed in the corporation’s charter, in which case a
change in the number of directors shall be made only by
amendment to the corporation’s charter. Packard
BioScience’s by-laws fix the number of directors of at
least three but no more than 12. Packard BioScience currently
has eight directors.

Indemnification and Limitation of Liability

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide for indemnification of
PerkinElmer’s officers and directors for expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with claims, liabilities and
expenses to which such officer or director may be or become
subject by reason of his or her being or having been an officer
or a director of the corporation or by reason of his or her
alleged acts or omissions as an officer or director of the
corporation, except that no indemnification shall be provided
for any person if he or she has been adjudicated not to have
acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that his or her
action was in the best interests of the corporation or if
indemnification under the circumstances is deemed to be against
public policy. Massachusetts law contains provisions similar to
those Delaware law provisions described below which allow for
advancement of expenses, the purchase of indemnity insurance,
and the elimination or limitation of liability.
PerkinElmer’s charter eliminates the personal liability of
directors to PerkinElmer or to stockholders for monetary damages
for beach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by
Massachusetts law.

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioScience’s charter
eliminates the personal liability of directors to Packard
BioScience or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty to the full extent permitted by Delaware law,
except for a breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions
not taken in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, unlawful payments of dividends or
stock repurchases or transactions from which a director derived
an improper personal benefit. Packard BioScience’s charter
and by-laws further provide that Packard BioScience may
indemnify its officers and directors to the full extent
permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law authorizes a corporation
to indemnify directors, officers, employees and agents of the
corporation if the party acted in good faith in a manner he
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the
corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful. Delaware law further provides that indemnification
shall be provided if the party in question is successful on the
merits or otherwise. Delaware law and Packard BioScience’s
by-laws also provide for the advancement of attorneys fees and
other expenses, provided the director or officer provides the
corporation an undertaking to repay these advanced expenses if
it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be
indemnified by the corporation. In addition, Delaware law
provides for the elimination or limitation of personal liability
of directors for monetary damages resulting from a breach of
fiduciary duties except in certain situations, including any
breach of the duty of loyalty. Delaware law also provides that a
corporation may obtain directors’ and officers’
insurance to provide coverage to officers, directors, employees
and agents.



The Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its
position that the indemnification of directors, officers and
controlling persons against liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Interested Director Transaction

PerkinElmer.
 The PerkinElmer by-laws provide that, absent
fraud, no contract or other transaction between PerkinElmer and
any other entity or person will be affected or invalidated by
the fact that a director or officer of PerkinElmer is directly
or indirectly pecuniarily or otherwise interested in or
connected to, or is a party to, the contract or transaction, as
long as the director’s or officer’s interest in or
connection to the transaction or contract is disclosed to and
known by the PerkinElmer board at the time it approves the
transaction or contract. Any such transaction or contract must
be approved by a majority of directors of PerkinElmer who are
not interested in or connected to the contract or transaction.
Massachusetts law provides that directors who vote for and
officers who knowingly participate in loans to officers or
directors are jointly and severally liable to the corporation
for any part of the loan which is not repaid, unless a majority
of the directors who are not direct or indirect recipients of
such loans or a majority of the stockholders have approved or
ratified the loan as one which in their judgment may reasonably
be expected to benefit the corporation.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that no
transaction between a corporation and a director or officer or
any entity in which any of them have an interest is void or
voidable solely for this reason or solely because the director
or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the
board or committee which authorized the contract or transaction.
A transaction is also not void or voidable solely because a
director’s votes are counted for such purpose if
(1) after full disclosure the transaction is approved by
the disinterested directors or by the stockholders or
(2) the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time
it is approved.

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law and the PerkinElmer
by-laws provide that, unless otherwise filled by the
stockholders, any vacancy in the board of directors including a
vacancy resulting from enlargement of the board be filled by the
directors.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that vacancies
and newly created directorships may be filled by a majority of
directors then in office, unless the charter or by-laws provide
otherwise. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or newly
created directorship, the directors then in office constitute
less than a majority of the entire board as constituted
immediately prior to any increase, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of shares
at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such
directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any
such vacancies or newly created directorships or to replace the
directors chosen by the directors at any time to fill a vacancy
not filled by the directors. Packard BioScience’s by-laws
provide that any vacancy on the Packard BioScience board shall
be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even though less than a
quorum of the board of directors. Any director elected in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the
remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which
the vacancy occurred and until the director’s successor
shall be elected and qualified.

Approval of Business Combinations and Asset Sales

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law and the PerkinElmer
charter and by-laws, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
shares of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote,
or which would be adversely affected by a merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a
corporation, is generally necessary to approve any of these
types of transactions.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of stock outstanding and
entitled to vote is necessary to approve a merger or certain
asset sales. In addition,



Delaware law permits a company to merge with a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary without stockholder approval
under certain circumstances so as to cause the corporation to
become a holding company.

Anti-Takeover Legislation

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law contains a three-year
moratorium on business combinations between a corporation and
interested stockholders, unless certain conditions are met. In
addition, the Massachusetts control share acquisition statute
restricts the voting rights of shares acquired under specified
circumstances. PerkinElmer has elected to opt out of the control
share acquisitions provision of the Massachusetts corporate
statute. PerkinElmer could, however, opt into these control
share acquisitions provisions at any time by amending its
by-laws. For a more complete description of the Massachusetts
control share acquisition provisions, please see the sections
entitled “Description of PerkinElmer Capital
Stock — Certain Provisions of PerkinElmer’s
By-laws and Massachusetts law — Business Combinations
with Interested Stockholders” and “— Control
Share Acquisitions.”

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, “business
combinations” by corporation with “interested
stockholders” are subject to a moratorium of three years,
unless specified conditions are met. The prohibited transactions
include a merger with, disposition of assets to, or the issuance
of stock to, the interested stockholder, or certain transactions
that have the effect of increasing the proportionate share of
the outstanding securities held by the interested stockholder.

Under Delaware law, an interested stockholder may avoid the
prohibition against effecting certain significant transactions
with the corporation if the board of directors, prior to the
time such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder,
approves such transaction or the transaction by which such
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder or if at or
subsequent to such time the board of directors and the
stockholders approve such transaction. These provisions of
Delaware law apply to a Delaware corporation unless the
corporation “opts out” of the provisions in its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Packard BioScience has
not opted out of these provisions in its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws and consequently is subject to these
provisions.

Stockholder Rights Agreement

PerkinElmer.
 Under its stockholder rights agreement, each
outstanding share of PerkinElmer common stock has attached to it
a stock purchase right. These stock purchase rights trade with
the PerkinElmer common stock and are not currently exercisable.
The stock purchase rights generally become exercisable upon the
earlier to occur of:

• 

	ten days following a public announcement by PerkinElmer that a
	person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more
	of the outstanding PerkinElmer common stock; or

• 

	ten business days after the beginning of a tender offer or
	exchange offer that would result in a person or group
	beneficially owning 30% or more of the outstanding PerkinElmer
	common stock.

The stock purchase rights are exercisable for shares of
PerkinElmer common stock or series C junior participating
preferred stock depending upon the circumstances under which the
stock purchase rights are exercised. In some cases, the exercise
price of the stock purchase rights may be significantly below
the market value of PerkinElmer’s common stock.

PerkinElmer may redeem the stock purchase rights at a price of
$.01 per right at any time until ten days after the date on
which a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding PerkinElmer common stock. The stock
purchase rights will expire on the close of business on
February 8, 2005. See the section entitled
“Description of PerkinElmer Capital Stock —
Stockholder Rights Plan.”

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioScience does not have a
stockholder rights plan.



Dissenters’ Rights

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law, dissenting
stockholders who follow prescribed statutory procedures are
entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with any
merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of a
corporation’s assets and in connection with the adoption of
charter amendments that may adversely affect the rights or
preferences of stockholders.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, Packard
BioScience stockholders do not have dissenters’ rights in
the case of mergers or consolidations where they are required to
accept in such a merger only (1) shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation, (2) shares of a corporation listed
on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
market system security or an interdealer quotation system by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders, (3) cash in lieu of
fractional shares or (4) any combination thereof.



DESCRIPTION OF PERKINELMER CAPITAL STOCK

The following description of PerkinElmer’s common stock and
preferred stock summarizes the material terms and provisions of
these types of securities. For the complete terms of
PerkinElmer’s common stock and preferred stock, please
refer to PerkinElmer’s charter, by-laws and stockholder
rights plan, which have been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The terms of these securities may also be
affected by Massachusetts law.

Under the PerkinElmer charter, PerkinElmer’s authorized
capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock,
$1.00 par value per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $1.00 par value per share.

Common Stock

As of August 21, 2001, PerkinElmer had
          shares
 of common stock issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share
of common stock currently has attached to it one-half of one
preferred share purchase right issued under the PerkinElmer
stockholder rights plan, which is summarized below. All
outstanding shares of common stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Voting

For all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, each holder
of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share
registered in his or her name on the books of PerkinElmer.
PerkinElmer common stock does not have cumulative voting rights.
As a result, subject to the voting rights of any outstanding
preferred stock, of which there currently is none, persons who
hold more than 50% of the outstanding common stock entitled to
elect members of the PerkinElmer board of directors can elect
all of the directors who are up for election in a particular
year.

Dividends

If the PerkinElmer board of directors declares a dividend,
holders of the PerkinElmer common stock will receive payments
from the funds of PerkinElmer that are legally available to pay
dividends. However, this dividend right is subject to any
preferential dividend rights PerkinElmer may grant to holders of
preferred stock, if any is outstanding.

Liquidation

If PerkinElmer is dissolved, the holders of common stock will be
entitled to share ratably in all the assets that remain after
payment of PerkinElmer liabilities and any amounts owed to the
persons who hold preferred stock, if any is outstanding.

Other Rights And Restrictions

Holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights, and they
have no right to convert their common stock into any other
securities. PerkinElmer common stock is not subject to
redemption by PerkinElmer. PerkinElmer’s charter and
by-laws do not restrict the ability of a holder of common stock
to transfer his, her or its shares of common stock.

When PerkinElmer issues shares of common stock, the shares will
be fully paid and non-assessable. Massachusetts law provides
that, if PerkinElmer makes a distribution to its stockholders
other than a distribution of PerkinElmer capital stock, when it
is insolvent, or that renders it insolvent, then PerkinElmer
stockholders would be required to pay back to PerkinElmer the
amount of the distribution made to them, or the portion of the
distribution that causes PerkinElmer to become insolvent.

Listing

PerkinElmer common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.



Transfer Agent And Registrar

The transfer agent and registrar for PerkinElmer common stock is
Mellon Investor Services LLC.

Preferred Stock

As of August 21, 2001, PerkinElmer had no shares of
preferred stock outstanding. PerkinElmer’s charter
authorizes the PerkinElmer board of directors to issue preferred
stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights
and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences,
conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund
provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of
each series of preferred stock.

As of August 21, 2001, PerkinElmer board of directors had
designated 70,000 shares of preferred stock as
“Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock”
in connection with PerkinElmer stockholder rights plan. The
rights, preferences and privileges of the series C preferred
stock are described below.

Series C Preferred Stock

The PerkinElmer board has reserved the series C preferred
stock for issuance in connection with PerkinElmer stockholder
rights plan, which is described below. As of August 21,
2001, there were no shares of series C preferred stock
outstanding. The following description is a summary of all the
material terms of PerkinElmer series C preferred stock. It
does not restate these terms in their entirety. PerkinElmer
urges you to read its charter because it, and not this
description, defines the rights of holders of series C
preferred stock.

Voting.
 Each share of series C preferred stock is
entitled to 1,000 votes, subject to adjustment. Except as
provided below, each share of series C preferred stock
votes together with the holders of common stock and all other
capital stock of PerkinElmer on all matters voted on by
stockholders.

In the event that PerkinElmer fails to pay six quarterly
dividends on the series C preferred stock, the holders of
the series C preferred stock, voting as a single class, will
have the right to elect two members of the PerkinElmer board of
directors. Any director elected by the holders of series C
preferred stock may be removed with or without cause by such
holders. The terms of all directors elected under this provision
will terminate when the dividend arrearage is fully paid and, in
addition, PerkinElmer has paid at least one regular dividend
after the curing of the arrearage.

Without the vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of series C preferred stock, PerkinElmer may not alter or
repeal any provisions in PerkinElmer’s charter so as to
adversely affect the rights of the series C preferred stock.

Dividends.
 With respect to the payment of dividends and
the distribution of assets, the series C preferred stock
ranks junior to all series of all other series of preferred
stock, unless the terms of a particular series provide
otherwise. The holders of shares of series C preferred stock are
entitled to cash dividends equal to the greater of
(a) $1.00 or (b) 1,000 times the per share amount of
all cash dividends and 1,000 times the per share amount of all
non-cash dividends, other than dividends payable in common stock
or by a subdivision of the outstanding common stock, which have
been declared on the common stock since the preceding quarterly
dividend payment date. Dividends on the series C preferred
stock are payable quarterly on the first day of March, June,
September and December each year.

The PerkinElmer board of directors must declare a dividend on
the series C preferred stock after it declares any dividend on
the common stock, other than dividends payable in common stock.
However, if the PerkinElmer board of directors does not declare
a dividend on the common stock during the period between
quarterly dividend payment dates, a dividend of $1.00 per share
of series C preferred stock will still be payable on the
following quarterly dividend payment date. Dividends begin to
accrue and accumulate on outstanding shares of series C
preferred stock from the quarterly dividend payment date
preceding the date of issuance of such shares.



Liquidation.
 If PerkinElmer liquidates, dissolves or
winds up, then it:

• 

	must pay the holders of outstanding shares of series C
	preferred stock, before it makes any payment to the holders of
	shares of stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock, an amount equal to $1,000 per share, plus all unpaid
	accrued dividends or, if greater, an amount equal to 1,000 times
	the amount to be paid to holders of common stock; and

• 

	may not make any distribution to the holders of shares of stock
	ranking on a parity with the series C preferred stock,
	except for distributions made ratably to the holders of
	series C preferred stock and other classes or series of
	preferred stock.

For purposes of this liquidation preference, neither the
consolidation, merger or other business combination of
PerkinElmer with another entity nor the sale of all or any of
PerkinElmer property, assets or business will be treated as a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of PerkinElmer.

Merger, Consolidation or Similar Transaction.
 If
PerkinElmer is a party to any merger, consolidation or similar
transaction in which shares of common stock are exchanged or
changed into stock or securities of another entity, cash or
property of another entity, then the series C preferred stock
will be exchanged or changed into an amount per share equal to
1,000 times the amount of consideration into which or for which
each share of common stock is changed or exchanged in such
merger, consolidation or similar transaction.

Adjustments For Stock Splits And Other Events.
 In the
event that PerkinElmer declares a dividend on its common stock
that is payable in common stock or it effects a subdivision,
combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of its
common stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, then the
dividend, liquidation and merger or consolidation amounts
payable to holders of series C preferred stock will be
increased or reduced in proportion to the resulting increase or
decrease in the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding.

Certain Restrictions.
 If any quarterly dividends payable
on the series C preferred stock are in arrears, then, until
all of these unpaid dividends have been paid in full,
PerkinElmer may not:

• 

	declare or pay dividends on any shares of stock ranking junior
	to the series C preferred stock;

• 

	declare or pay any dividends on any shares of stock ranking on a
	parity with the series C preferred stock, except ratably
	among all of these parity stocks;

• 

	redeem any stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock, unless it redeems the junior stock by issuing additional
	shares of stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock; or

• 

	redeem any shares of series C preferred stock or shares of
	stock ranking on a parity with the shares of series C
	preferred stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer to
	all holders of these series or classes upon terms that the
	PerkinElmer board of directors deems fair and equitable.

PerkinElmer may not permit any of its subsidiaries to purchase
any shares of PerkinElmer stock, unless it is able at such time
to purchase shares in accordance with the terms described in the
preceding paragraph.

Redemption.
 PerkinElmer cannot redeem the series C
preferred stock.

Fractional Shares.
 PerkinElmer may issue the
series C preferred stock in fractions of a single share,
but each fraction must be a multiple of one one-thousandth of a
share. Each fractional share of series C preferred stock
will have proportionate voting, dividend, liquidation and other
rights as discussed above.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On January 25, 1995, the PerkinElmer board of directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan. This stockholder rights plan
was amended and restated on January 30, 2001. Under this
stockholder rights plan, each PerkinElmer common stockholder
received a dividend of one “preferred stock purchase
right” for each outstanding share of common stock that the
stockholder owned. PerkinElmer refers to these preferred



stock purchase rights as the “Rights.” As a result of
the two-for-one stock split effected by PerkinElmer on
June 4, 2001, pursuant to the terms of the stockholder
rights plan, the number of Rights distributed per share of
PerkinElmer common stock has been proportionately adjusted to
one-half a Right per share. The Rights trade automatically with
shares of PerkinElmer common stock and become exercisable only
under certain circumstances described below.

The purpose of the Rights is to encourage potential acquirers to
negotiate with the PerkinElmer board of directors before
attempting a takeover bid and to provide the PerkinElmer board
of directors with leverage in negotiating on behalf of the
PerkinElmer stockholders the terms of any proposed takeover. The
Rights may have certain antitakeover effects. They should not,
however, interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the PerkinElmer board of directors.

The following description is a summary of all the material terms
of the PerkinElmer stockholder rights plan. It does not restate
these terms in their entirety. For the complete terms of
PerkinElmer’s stockholder rights plan, please refer to
PerkinElmer’s stockholder rights plan filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy at no
charge by writing to us at the address listed under the caption
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

Exercise Of Rights.
 Until a Right is exercised, the
holder of a Right will not have any rights as a stockholder.
When the Rights become exercisable, holders of the Rights will
be able to purchase from PerkinElmer a unit equal to 1/1000th of
a share of PerkinElmer series C preferred stock, at a purchase
price of $60 per unit.

In general, the rights will become exercisable upon the earlier
of:

• 

	ten days following a public announcement by PerkinElmer that a
	person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more
	of the outstanding shares of common stock; or

• 

	ten business days after the beginning of a tender offer or
	exchange offer that would result in a person or group
	beneficially owning 30% or more of the PerkinElmer common stock.

Flip In Event.
 If a person or group becomes the
beneficial owner of 20% or more of PerkinElmer common stock,
then each Right will then entitle its holder to receive, upon
exercise, a number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock which
is equal to (a) the exercise price of the right divided by
(b) one-half of the market price of PerkinElmer common
stock on the date of the occurrence of this event. This
occurrence is known as a “flip in event.” A flip in
event does not occur if there is an offer for all of PerkinElmer
outstanding shares of common stock that the PerkinElmer board of
directors determines is fair to its stockholders and in
PerkinElmer’s best interests.

Flip Over Event. 
If at any time after a person or group
becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of
PerkinElmer’s common stock, (a) PerkinElmer is
acquired in a merger or other transaction in which PerkinElmer
does not survive or in which the PerkinElmer common stock is
changed or exchanged or (b) 50% or more of PerkinElmer’s
assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then each holder
of a Right will be entitled to receive, upon exercise, a number
of shares of common stock of the acquiring company in the
transaction equal to (1) the exercise price of the Right
divided by (2) one-half of the market price of the
acquiring company’s common stock on the date of the
occurrence of this event. This exercise right will not occur if
the merger or other transaction follows an offer for all of
PerkinElmer’s outstanding shares of common stock that the
PerkinElmer board of directors determines is fair to PerkinElmer
stockholders and in PerkinElmer’s best interests.

Exchange Of Rights. 
At any time after a flip in event,
the PerkinElmer board of directors may exchange the Rights by
providing to the holder one share of PerkinElmer common stock or
one one-thousandth of a share of PerkinElmer series C
preferred stock for each of the holder’s Rights.

Redemption Of Rights.
 At any time until ten days after
the date on which a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
PerkinElmer common stock, PerkinElmer may redeem the Rights at a
price of $.01 per Right. The Rights will expire on the close of



business on February 8, 2005, subject to earlier expiration
or termination as described in the PerkinElmer stockholder
rights plan.

Certain Provisions Of PerkinElmer’s By-laws And
Massachusetts Law

PerkinElmer’s by-laws.
 PerkinElmer’s by-laws
impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of
stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders. For
example, requests for stockholder meetings may be made only
during limited periods of time and must be made by a group of
stockholders holding at least 40%, or, if less, the maximum
percentage permitted by law, of the outstanding capital stock
entitled to vote at the meeting.

Business Combinations With Interested Stockholders.

Massachusetts law contain antitakeover provisions regarding,
among other things, business combinations with an affiliated
stockholder. In general, Massachusetts law prevents a publicly
held Massachusetts corporation from engaging in a “business
combination” as defined in the Massachusetts corporation
statute with an “interested stockholder” for a period
of three years after the date of the transaction in which the
person became an interested stockholder, unless:

• 

	before the date on which the person became an interested
	stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved
	either the business combination or the transaction in which the
	person became an interested stockholder;

• 

	the interested stockholder acquires 90% of the outstanding
	voting stock of the corporation at the time it becomes an
	interested stockholder; or

• 

	the business combination is approved by the board of directors
	and the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of
	the corporation voting at a meeting, excluding the voting stock
	owned by the interested stockholder.

An “interested stockholder” is generally a person
owning more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation. A business combination includes mergers,
consolidations, stock and assets sales and other transactions
with the interested stockholder which result in a financial
benefit to the interested stockholder.

Control Share Acquisitions

PerkinElmer has elected to opt out of the control share
acquisitions provision of the Massachusetts corporation statute.
PerkinElmer could, however, opt into these control share
acquisitions provisions at any time by amending its by-laws.

In general, the control share acquisitions provision of the
Massachusetts corporation statute provides that any person,
including his, her or its affiliates, who acquires shares of a
corporation that is subject to the control share acquisitions
statute and whose shares represent one-fifth or more, one-third
or more, or a majority or more of the voting power of the
corporation in the election of directors cannot exercise any
voting power with respect to those shares, or any shares
acquired by the person within 90 days before or after an
acquisition of this nature, unless these voting rights are
authorized by the stockholders of the corporation.

The authorization of voting rights requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares,
excluding shares owned by:

• 

	the person making an acquisition of this nature;

• 

	any officer of the corporation; and

• 

	any employee who is also a director of the corporation.



There are several other types of share acquisitions that are not
subject to this provision of the Massachusetts corporation
statute, including acquisitions of shares:

• 

	under a tender offer, merger or consolidation which is made in
	connection with an agreement to which the corporation is a
	party; and

• 

	directly from the corporation or a wholly-owned subsidiary of
	the corporation.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

In order to be considered for addition to the agenda for
PerkinElmer’s 2002 annual meeting of stockholders and to be
included in the proxy statement for that meeting and form of
proxy, stockholder proposals should be addressed to the clerk of
PerkinElmer and must be received at the corporate offices of
PerkinElmer no later than November 13, 2001.

Stockholders who wish to make a proposal at PerkinElmer’s
2002 annual meeting, other than one that will be included in
PerkinElmer’s proxy materials, should notify PerkinElmer no
later than January 28, 2002. If a stockholder who wishes to
present a proposal fails to notify PerkinElmer by this date, the
proxies that management solicits for the meeting will have
discretionary authority to vote on the stockholder’s
proposal if it is properly brought before the meeting. If a
stockholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may still
exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances
consistent with the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Packard BioScience will hold an annual meeting in the year 2001
only if the merger has not already been completed. If Packard
BioScience holds an annual meeting, stockholders must submit
proposals by letter addressed to Packard BioScience in care of
its corporate secretary within a reasonable time before the
printing and mailing of the 2001 annual meeting proxy materials.
The deadline for notice of a proposal for which a stockholder
will conduct his or her own solicitation is the same. If a
proposal or nomination is not submitted by this time, the
management proxies will be allowed to use their discretionary
authority with respect to the stockholder proposal or nomination.

LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in connection with the merger will be passed on for
PerkinElmer by Hale and Dorr LLP, Boston, Massachusetts. Certain
legal matters with respect to the federal income tax
consequences of the merger will be passed upon for PerkinElmer
by Hale and Dorr LLP, Boston, Massachusetts, and for Packard
BioScience by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, New York, New
York.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”),
dated as of July 13, 2001, is by and among PerkinElmer,
Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the “Buyer”), Pablo
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the “Transitory Subsidiary”),
and Packard BioScience Company, a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”).

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Buyer and the Company
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and their respective stockholders that the Buyer acquire the
Company;

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected
through a merger (the “Merger”) of the Transitory
Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), as a result of which
the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the Buyer’s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) Stonington
Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. has entered into a
Stockholder’s Agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit A

(the “Stockholder’s Agreement”) and
(ii) the individuals and entities listed in

Exhibit B 
hereto have each entered into Voting
Agreements, in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit C

(the “Voting Agreements”), pursuant to which,
among other things, such stockholders have agreed to give the
Buyer a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the
Company that such stockholders own in favor of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth below, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1  
Effective Time of the Merger.
 Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, the
Buyer shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter the Buyer shall cause to be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate
of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) in such form
as is required by, and executed by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as is established by the Buyer
and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
“Effective Time”).

1.2  
Closing.
 The closing of the Merger (the
“Closing”) shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston
time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the Company
(the “Closing Date”), which shall be no later than the
second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of
items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction
of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street,
Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date, place or time is
agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company.

1.3  
Effects of the Merger.
 At the Effective
Time (i) the separate existence of the Transitory
Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company (the Transitory Subsidiary and
the Company are sometimes referred to herein as the
“Constituent

A-8



Corporations” and the Company following the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the “Surviving
Corporation”), (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
be amended so that Article FOURTH of such Certificate of
Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: “The total
number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall
consist of common stock, $.01 par value per share,” and, as
so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
further amended in accordance with the DGCL and (iii) the
By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to change all
references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary to refer to
the name of the Company, and, as so amended, such By-laws shall
be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4  
Directors and Officers.
 The directors and
officers of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1  
Conversion of Capital Stock.
 As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of
the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

	(a)  
Capital Stock of the Transitory
	Subsidiary.
 Each share of the common stock of the Transitory
	Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
	Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
	and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per
	share, of the Surviving Corporation.

	(b)  
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned
	Stock.
 All shares of common stock, $.002 par value per
	share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that
	are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly
	owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common
	Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other
	wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the
	Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
	no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered
	in exchange therefor.

	(c)  
Conversion of Company Common Stock.

	Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock
	(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
	Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
	the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the
	right to receive 0.311 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”)
	of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Buyer
	(“Buyer Common Stock”) upon surrender of the
	certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in
	the manner provided in Section 2.2. The Exchange Ratio is
	sometimes referred to as the “Merger Consideration.”
	As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
	Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
	cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
	certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
	shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
	right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
	Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
	Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
	therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
	Section 2.2, without interest.

	(d)  
Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.
 In the
	event of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock
	dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
	convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
	the case may be), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
	change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Common
	Stock, as the case may be, occurring (or for which a record date
	is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
	Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to
	reflect fully such event.

A-9



	(e)  
Unvested Stock.
 At the Effective Time, any
	Merger Consideration issued or paid in accordance with
	Section 2.1(c) with respect to any unvested shares of
	Company Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or
	consultants pursuant to any of the Company’s plans or
	arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
	Time shall remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and
	vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
	Time, except to the extent by their terms such unvested shares
	of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective Time. The Company
	shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate
	vesting of any unvested shares, except to the extent required by
	their terms as in effect on the date hereof. Copies of the
	relevant agreements governing such shares and the vesting
	thereof have been made available to the Buyer. All outstanding
	rights which the Company may hold immediately prior to the
	Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common
	Stock shall be assigned to the Buyer in the Merger and shall
	thereafter be exercisable by the Buyer upon the same terms and
	conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
	except that the shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and
	the purchase price payable per share shall be appropriately
	adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall take
	all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this
	Section 2.1(e) to occur.

	(f)  
Treatment of Company Stock Options.

	Following the Effective Time, Company Stock Options shall be
	treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.12.

2.2  
Exchange of Certificates.
 The procedures
for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

	(a)  
Exchange Agent.
 As of the Effective Time,
	the Buyer shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated
	by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
	“Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of
	shares of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
	with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent,
	(i) certificates representing that number of whole shares
	of Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of shares of
	Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
	(ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for
	fractional shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
	(iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of
	shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to
	Section 2.2(c). The shares of Buyer Common Stock deposited
	with the Exchange Agent pursuant to clause (i) above,
	together with any dividends or distributions with respect
	thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, and the
	cash deposited pursuant to clause (ii) above being
	hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund.”

	(b)  
Exchange Procedures.
 As soon as reasonably
	practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
	mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
	which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
	outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the
	“Certificates”) whose shares were converted pursuant
	to Section 2.1 into the right to receive Merger
	Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
	specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
	title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
	Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
	have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify)
	and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
	Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (plus cash
	in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and
	any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon
	surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
	Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
	the Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
	executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
	by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
	entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate
	representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
	which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
	Section 2.1(c), (B) cash in an amount sufficient to
	make payments for fractional shares pursuant to the provisions
	of Section 2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or
	distributions pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(c),
	and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
	cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
	Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
	the Company, (x) a certificate representing the proper

A-10



	number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to
	Section 2.1(c), (y) the proper amount of cash in lieu
	of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
	(z) any dividends or distributions pursuant to
	Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid to a person other than
	the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
	registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
	Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
	effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
	transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated
	by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at
	any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
	receive upon such surrender (1) the Merger Consideration
	issuable or payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
	(2) cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
	Section 2.2(e) and (3) any dividends or distributions
	pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as contemplated by this
	Section 2.2.

	(c)  
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged
	Shares.
 No dividends or other distributions declared or made
	after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock with
	a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
	holder of any unsurrendered Certificate and no cash payment in
	lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
	pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of
	such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
	the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
	Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder
	of the Certificate, (i) certificates representing whole
	shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
	(ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
	payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to
	which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
	and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
	date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to
	such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, without interest and
	(iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
	dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
	Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
	subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
	shares of Buyer Common Stock.

	(d)  
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
	Stock.
 All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the
	surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
	terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
	distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or 2.2(e))
	shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
	satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
	Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall
	be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
	books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
	Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
	Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
	presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
	any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
	this Article II.

	(e)  
No Fractional Shares.
 No certificate or
	scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall
	be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
	such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
	thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the
	Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
	to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
	a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into
	account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
	receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
	equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock
	multiplied by the weighted average of the per share selling
	prices of the Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
	(“NYSE”) during the ten consecutive trading days
	ending on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.

	(f)  
Termination of Exchange Fund.
 Any portion
	of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders
	of Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective
	Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any
	holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied
	with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the
	Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim
	for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
	of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and

	(g)  
No Liability.
 To the extent permitted by
	applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary,
	the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
	shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
	or Buyer Common Stock or to any other person for such shares of
	Buyer Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
	thereto) delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
	to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If
	any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one
	year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
	earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, and any cash in
	lieu of fractional shares payable to the holder of such
	Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or
	distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant
	to Section 2.2(c) would otherwise escheat to or become the
	property of any Governmental Entity), all such Merger
	Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares, dividends or
	distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
	extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
	Buyer, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
	previously entitled thereto.

Withholding Rights.
 Each of the Buyer and
	the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
	withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
	this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
	such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to
	deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
	under the Code, or any other applicable provision of law. To the
	extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
	or the Buyer, as the case may be, and timely paid to the
	applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be
	treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
	to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect
	of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
	Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.

	(i)  
Lost Certificates.
 If any Certificate
	shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
	affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
	to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
	Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
	such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct
	as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
	respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
	exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
	Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and
	unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Buyer Common
	Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

	(j)

 Notwithstanding
	anything herein to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for
	exchange by any affiliate of the Company (within the meaning of
	Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act) (each such
	person, a “Rule 145 Affiliate”) shall not be
	exchanged until the Buyer has received an Affiliate Agreement
	from such Rule 145 Affiliate.

3.1

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the

taken as a whole, (III) conditions, events or circumstances
directly arising out of or directly attributable to (x) a
material breach of this Agreement by the Buyer or the Transitory

involving the parties hereto contemplated by this Agreement, or
(IV) conditions, events or circumstances directly arising
out of or directly attributable to the public announcement of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not be taken into account in determining whether there has been
or would be a “Company Material Adverse Effect”.

(b)  Neither the Company nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity, membership,
partnership or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity, membership,

the voting interest in such partnership), (II) such party
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries holds voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing
body performing similar functions, or (III) such party
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,
owns or controls more than 50% of the equity, membership,
partnership or similar interests, and (ii) the term

be a “significant subsidiary” as defined in
Article I, Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the
SEC, as such regulation is in effect on the date hereof, except
that all references to 10% in Rule 1-02(w)(1), (2) and (3)
shall be deemed to be 3% and references to total assets shall be
deemed to include all of the Company’s current, long-term
and other assets.

the effect of causing the Company not to be subject to any state

benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a
change in control under, require the payment of a penalty under
or result in the imposition of any Lien on the Company’s or
any of its Subsidiary’s assets under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with the

or any of its or their properties or assets, except in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.3(b) for
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or losses as would

any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may
be required under applicable state securities laws and
(vi) such other consents, licenses, permits, orders,

(including without limitation Section 4980 B of the
Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and
Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq.
of ERISA) and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Company’s Subsidiaries and their ERISA
Affiliates has in all material respects met its obligations with
respect to such Company Employee Plan and has made all required
contributions thereto (or reserved such contributions on the
Company Balance Sheet). All material filings and reports as to

association” within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. No Company Employee Plan holds securities issued by
the Company, any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates.

benefits accrued through the date of amendment or termination,
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof
and no such Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or
agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms
prohibits the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries
party thereto or covered thereby from amending or terminating
any such Company Employee Plan.

(h)  Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to

the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions

aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company

payments that may be treated as an “excess parachute
payment” as defined in Section 280G of the Code
determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code. The Company has provided to the Buyer such accurate
information as shall be necessary to enable the Buyer to
calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the Code
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for which the Company or the Buyer may directly or indirectly
become liable, and the amount of deductions that may be
disallowed under Section 280G of the Code as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.14  
Compliance With Laws.
 The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have complied with, are not in
violation of, and have not received any notice alleging any
violation with respect to, any applicable provisions of any
foreign, federal, state or local statute, law or regulation
applicable to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or
operation of its properties or assets, except for such failures
to comply, violations and notices as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

A-25



3.15  
Permits.
 The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their
businesses (the “Company Permits”), except for such
permits, licenses and franchises the failure to have which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits, and (ii) no Company Permit
shall cease to be effective as a result of the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.16  
Labor Matters.
 Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization. To the
Company’s knowledge, there is no material pending or
threatened (i) labor strike, or (ii) dispute, walkout,
work stoppage, slow-down, lockout or organizational effort
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.17  
Insurance.
 To the Company’s
knowledge, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies (the “Insurance Policies”) with
reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a character
and in such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses.
Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the insurance coverages maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and a history of any claims made and claims paid
since January 1, 1998. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Insurance Policy is in
full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and enforceable,
and all premiums due thereon have been paid in full,
(ii) none of the Insurance Policies shall terminate or
lapse (or be affected in any other adverse manner) by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with the
provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the
insured party, (iv) no insurer under any Insurance Policy
has canceled or generally disclaimed liability under any such
policy or indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such
policy and (v) all claims under the Insurance Policies have
been filed in a timely fashion.

3.18  
Warranty.
 The Company has no reason to
believe that the warranty costs of it and its Subsidiaries will
materially increase as a percentage of their consolidated
revenues in the future (assuming that management of the Company
and its Subsidiaries following the Closing will be undertaken in
a manner consistent with past practice). To the Company’s
knowledge, since January 1, 1998, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not performed warranty service with respect to
any particular product or product line materially in excess of
the warranty service typically required to be performed with
respect to the products and product lines of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (the Buyer acknowledging that the
Company and its Subsidiaries do not track or record warranty
service on a product or product line basis).

3.19  
Customers and Suppliers.
 No customer
(including any Affiliate thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries represented 5% or more of the Company’s
consolidated revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 or in the three-month period ended March 31, 2001. No
supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose failure
to continue to be a supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect has indicated to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it will stop, or
materially decrease the rate of, supplying materials, products
or services to them.

3.20  
No Existing Discussions.
 As of the date
of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any
discussions or negotiations with any other party with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal.

3.21  
Opinion of Financial Advisor.
 The
financial advisor of the Company, JP Morgan
Chase & Co., has delivered to the Company an opinion
dated the date of this Agreement to the effect, as of such date,
that the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of the
Company Common Stock from a financial point of view, a signed
copy of which opinion has been delivered to the Buyer.

A-26



3.22  
Section 203 of the DGCL Not
Applicable.
 The Company Board has taken all actions
necessary so that the restrictions contained in Section 203
of the DGCL applicable to a “business combination” (as
defined in Section 203) shall not apply to the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
Stockholder’s Agreement, the Voting Agreements or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Stockholder’s Agreement
or the Voting Agreements.

3.23  
Brokers.
 No agent, broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other firm, or person is or shall
be entitled, as a result of any action, agreement or commitment
of the Company or any of its Affiliates, to any broker’s,
finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or
commission in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except JP Morgan
Chase & Co., whose fees and expense shall be paid by
the Company.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER AND THE

TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY

The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary represent and warrant to
the Company that the statements contained in this
Article IV are true and correct, except as expressly set
forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary to the Company on or before
the date of this Agreement (the “Buyer Disclosure
Schedule”). The Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the disclosure
in any paragraph shall qualify (1) the corresponding
paragraph in this Article IV and (2) such other
paragraphs in this Article IV only to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent from a reading of such document that it also
qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.

4.1  
Organization, Standing and Power.
 Each of
the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business, and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such
failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, which have not resulted in,
and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term “Buyer Material Adverse Effect” means any
material adverse change, event, circumstance, development or
effect on (i) the business, financial condition, or results
of operations of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

Buyer in and of itself, as quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange, (II) conditions, events or circumstances
generally adversely affecting the economies of the countries
where the Buyer and its Subsidiaries operate, the United States
securities markets or the industries in which the Buyer
operates, so long as such conditions, events or circumstances do
not materially disproportionately affect the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (III) conditions, events or
circumstances directly arising out of or directly attributable
to (x) a material breach of this Agreement by the Company
or (y) the Merger or any other transaction involving the
parties hereto contemplated by this Agreement, or
(IV) conditions, events or circumstances directly arising
out of or directly attributable to the public announcement of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not be taken into account in determining whether there has been
or would be a “Buyer Material Adverse Effect”.

4.2  
Capitalization.

(a)  The authorized capital stock of the Buyer
consists of 300,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share

101,327,183 shares of Buyer Common Stock were issued and
outstanding and no shares of Buyer Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding. Other than pursuant to the exercise of options
under the Buyer’s stock option plans, the Buyer has not,
since July 10, 2001 through the date of this Agreement,

Section 2.1(c) in connection with the Merger, when issued
on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call
option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, the Buyer’s
Articles of Organization or By-laws or any agreement to which
the Buyer is a party or is otherwise bound.

(b)  As of the date of this Agreement, except
(x) as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and (y) as reserved for future issuance under
options outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or for
future grants under stock option plans of the Buyer existing as
of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no equity
securities of any class of the Buyer, or any security
exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities,
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and (ii) there
are no options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character to which the Buyer is
a party or by which the Buyer is bound obligating the Buyer to
issue, exchange, transfer, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Buyer
or any security or rights convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any such shares or other equity interests. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Buyer has no (A) stock
appreciation rights or phantom stock or (B) performance
based rights or similar rights or obligations outstanding.

(c)  As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Buyer to

Consents.

(a)  Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated

unanimous vote of all directors (i) determined that the
Merger is fair and in the best interests of the Buyer and its
stockholders and (ii) resolved to recommend the Buyer
Voting Proposal to the Buyer’s stockholders. The execution

Transitory Subsidiary (including the approval of the Merger by
the Buyer in its capacity as the sole stockholder of the
Transitory Subsidiary), subject only to the approval of the
Buyer Voting Proposal (as defined in Section 6.5(b)) by the
stockholders of the Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance
with its terms.

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary does not, and
the consummation by the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
(i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
any provision of the Articles of Organization or By-laws of the
Buyer or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Transitory Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent or waiver
under, constitute a change in control under, require the payment
of a penalty under or result in the imposition of any Lien on
the Buyer’s or the Transitory Subsidiary’s assets
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other
agreement,

A-28



instrument or obligation to which the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to
compliance with the requirements specified in
Section 4.3(c), conflict with or violate any permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any of its or their
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 4.3(b) for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or losses as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

(c)  No consent, approval, license, permit, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer of the
Transitory Subsidiary or the consummation by the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (i) the pre-merger notification
requirements under the HSR Act, and any consents, approvals and
filings required under applicable foreign antitrust laws, (ii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate corresponding documents with
the Secretaries of State of other states in which the Company is
qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business,
(iii) the filing of the Registration Statement and Joint
Proxy Statement/ Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (iv) the filings of
such reports or schedules under Section 13 or
Rule 14a-12 (or other applicable rules) of the Exchange Act

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (v) such consents, approvals, orders,

connection with the Merger and (vii) such other consents,
licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, filings, approvals
and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. The affirmative vote
for the approval of the issuance of shares of Buyer Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger by the holders of a majority of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock voted at the Buyer Stockholders
Meeting at which a quorum of the holders of the outstanding
shares of Buyer Common Stock on the record date for the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Buyer’s capital stock or other
securities of the Buyer necessary to approve the consummation by
the Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.4  
SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Information
Provided.

(a)  The Buyer has filed all registration statements,
forms, reports and other documents required to be filed by the
Buyer with the SEC since January 1, 1998 and all such
registration statements, forms, reports and other documents are
available on EDGAR. All such registration statements, forms,
reports and other documents (including those that the Buyer may
file after the date hereof until the Closing) are referred to
herein as the “Buyer SEC Reports.” The Buyer SEC
Reports (i) were or will be filed on a timely basis,
(ii) at the time filed, were or will be prepared in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Buyer SEC Reports, and (iii) did not or
will not at the time they were or are filed contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated in such Buyer SEC Reports or necessary in
order to make the statements in such Buyer SEC Reports, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b)  Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes and schedules)
contained or to be contained in the Buyer SEC Reports at the
time filed (i) complied or will comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) were or will be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to

A-29



such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC under the Exchange Act and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder) and
(iii) fairly presented or will fairly present in accordance
with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, consistent with the books and records of the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount. The consolidated, unaudited balance sheet of
the Buyer as of April 1, 2001 is referred to herein as the
“Buyer Balance Sheet”.

(c)  The information in the Registration Statement
(except for information supplied by the Company for inclusion in
the Registration Statement, as to which the Buyer makes no
representation and which shall not constitute part of the Buyer
SEC Reports for purposes of this Agreement) shall not at the
time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated in the Registration
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Registration Statement not misleading. The information related
to the Buyer to be supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus is first mailed to stockholders of the
Buyer or the Company, at the time of the Buyer Stockholders
Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the Effective
Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus not false or
misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Buyer Stockholders
Meeting or the Company Stockholders Meeting which has become
false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event relating to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the Buyer which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus, the Buyer shall promptly inform the Company.

4.5  
No Undisclosed Liabilities.
 Except as
disclosed in the Buyer SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, and except for normal and recurring liabilities
incurred since the date of the Buyer Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries do
not have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent or
otherwise (whether or not required to be reflected in financial
statements in accordance with GAAP), and whether due or to
become due, except for any liabilities which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the incurrence of indebtedness for money borrowed by
the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries shall not be treated as
causing a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

4.6  
Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

Except as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, since the date of the Buyer Balance
Sheet, there has not been (i) any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) any material change by the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in its accounting methods not
required pursuant to GAAP.

4.7  
Tax Matters.
 To the Buyer’s
knowledge, after consulting with its advisors, neither the Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action
which would prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code.

4.8  
Litigation.
 Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as of the date hereof
(i) there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Buyer, threatened against or affecting the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) there are no judgments, orders or
decrees outstanding against the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

a general basis, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries own, license or
otherwise possess legally

A-30



enforceable rights to use all Intellectual Property used in or
necessary to the conduct of the business of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (the “Buyer Intellectual Property”),
except where the failure to own, license or have rights to use
such Buyer Intellectual Property would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. None of the (i) products sold by
the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) business or
activities conducted by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation of, or
infringed, violated or constituted a misappropriation of, any
Intellectual Property of any third party (including any software
programs and applications that are commercially available),
except for infringements, violations or misappropriations which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no contracts,
agreements or instruments that are material to the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that have not been filed as

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to

	(i)  the Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries have at
	all times complied with, and are not currently in violation of,
	any applicable Environmental Laws;

	(ii)  the Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries have all

of its Subsidiaries have complied with, are not in violation of,
and have not received any notice alleging any violation with
respect to, any applicable provisions of any foreign, federal,
state or local statute, law or regulation applicable to the
conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
properties or assets, except for such failures to comply,
violations and notices as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

4.13  
Permits.
 The Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their
businesses (the “Buyer Permits”), except for such
permits, licenses and franchises the failure to have which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Buyer
and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the Buyer Permits, and (ii) no Buyer Permit shall cease to
be effective as a result of the consummation of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

4.14

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1  
No Solicitation.

(a)  
No Solicitation or Negotiation.
 Except as
set forth in this Section 6.1, until the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof (the
“Specified Time”), the Company shall not, nor shall it
cause, authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or any of its or their directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and
representatives, collectively, “Representatives”) of
the Company or its Subsidiaries not to directly or indirectly:

	(i)  solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other
	action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
	or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
	lead to, any Acquisition

A-34



	Proposal, including approving any transaction (or any person
	becoming an “interested stockholder”) under
	Section 203 of the DGCL; or

	(ii)  enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
	any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person
	any information with respect to, assist or participate in any
	effort or attempt by any person with respect to, or otherwise
	cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.1, and subject to compliance with
Section 6.1(c), the Company may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company to any person (and the
Representatives of such persons) making an Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement not materially less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement (which need not have standstill provisions) and
(y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person
and its Representatives regarding any such Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by any
Affiliate or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

(b)  
No Change in Recommendation or Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
 Neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall, prior to the Specified Time:

	(i)  except as set forth in this Section 6.1(b),
	withdraw or propose to withdraw or knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner or propose to knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner, the approval or recommendation by the
	Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or the
	Merger;

	(ii)  cause or permit the Company to enter into any
	letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
	principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
	agreement (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”)
	constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal other than
	a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a)
	entered into in the circumstances referred to in such
	Section 6.1(a); or

	(iii)  adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to
	adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may
(x) withdraw or knowingly modify in any material adverse
manner the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or
any committee thereof of this Agreement and the Merger, if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisors) that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal as to which it intends
to enter into a binding written agreement as provided in
Section 8.1(i) and (y) adopt, approve or recommend, or
propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Superior Proposal
subject to compliance with Section 8.1(i) hereof.

(c)  
Notices to the Buyer; Additional
Negotiations.
 The Company shall promptly advise the Buyer
orally, with written confirmation to follow within 24 hours of
the occurrence, of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, by any person that the Company has knowledge may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
or request and the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall keep the
Buyer informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material
terms (including all changes to the status and material terms)
of any such Acquisition Proposal or request.

(d)  
Certain Permitted Disclosure.
 Nothing
contained in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange

A-35



Act or from making any other disclosure to its stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, based on the
advice of outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

(e)  
Cessation of Ongoing Discussions.
 The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations commenced on or prior to the date of this Agreement
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have all copies of all
nonpublic information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives have distributed since January 1, 2001, to
persons who have executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such person’s consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal, destroyed or returned to the Company as
soon as possible.

(f)  
Definitions.
 For purposes of this
Agreement:

	“Acquisition Proposal” means (i) any proposal or
	offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of
	substantial assets, tender offer, recapitalization, share
	exchange or other business combination involving the Company and
	its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any proposal for
	the issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of over
	20% of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer
	to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of
	the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the
	Company, in each case other than the Merger contemplated by this
	Agreement.

	“Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited, bona fide
	written proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially
	all the equity securities or assets of the Company pursuant to a
	tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation or a sale of
	its assets, (i) on terms which the Company Board determines
	in its good faith judgment to be more favorable from a financial
	point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
	transactions contemplated by this Agreement (based on the advice
	of a nationally recognized independent financial advisor),
	taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
	proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by the Buyer
	to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that is
	reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed,
	taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
	aspects of such proposal; provided, however, that no Acquisition
	Proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any
	financing required to consummate the Acquisition Proposal is not
	committed; provided, further, however, that a proposal to
	acquire less than substantially all of the equity securities of
	the Company may constitute a Superior Proposal if it satisfies
	the other provisions of this definition and provides for the
	acquisition of at least a majority of the Company’s equity
	securities so long as in the evaluation of the proposal the
	Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
	(X) that the value of the proposal of the third party,
	together with the fair market value of the equity securities to
	be retained by the holders of the Company Common Stock is more
	favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of the
	Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this
	Agreement (based on the advice of a nationally recognized
	independent financial advisor) taking into account all the terms
	and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and
	(Y) that the proposal is reasonably capable of being
	completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all
	financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

(a)  As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Buyer and the Company shall prepare and the

Prospectus, and the Buyer, in cooperation with the Company,
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement,
in which the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus shall be included
as a prospectus. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall respond
to any comments of the SEC and shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filings, and the Company shall cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to be mailed to its
stockholders at the earliest practicable time after both the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus is cleared by the SEC and the

A-36



Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall notify
the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or its staff or any other government officials and of any
request by the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus or any filing
pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or for additional information
and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government
officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, the Merger or
any filing pursuant to Section 6.2(b). Each of the Buyer
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or
other regulatory authorities under this Section 6.2 to
comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements
of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any filing pursuant to
Section 6.2(b), the Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of the
Company, of such amendment or supplement.

(b)  The Buyer and the Company shall promptly make all
necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the

Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyer’s officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to
the requirements of federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, assets and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably
request. The Buyer will hold any such information which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger.

(b)  In the event that the Company reasonably believes
that the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary has materially
breached one or more of their respective representations or
warranties under this Agreement, the Buyer shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford the Company’s
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance
notice, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records; provided that such access
shall be afforded solely to the extent that such access is
necessary to determine the existence of such a breach of one or
more representations or warranties of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary under this Agreement. The Company will
hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section
or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.4(c), neither party hereto nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree,
or, in the event of any

A-37



litigation or threatened litigation between the parties over the
terms of this Agreement, where such access to information may be
adverse to the interests of such party.

6.5

(including all applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock held by any

By-laws to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
45 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the

(ii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of
the Company Board that the Company’s stockholders vote in
favor of the Company Voting Proposal. The Company shall take all
action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and
shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of the Company Stockholders required by the
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or the DGCL to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, after consultation with the Buyer, the Company
may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus is provided
to the Company’s stockholders or, if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b)  The Buyer, acting through the Buyer Board, shall
take all actions in accordance with applicable law (including
all applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA) and its
Articles of Organization and By-laws to promptly and duly call,

in any event within 45 days after the declaration of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting to approve the
issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger (the “Buyer Voting Proposal”). The Buyer Board
shall (i) recommend approval of the Buyer Voting Proposal and
include in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus such
recommendation and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful
action to solicit and obtain such approval, provided that the
Buyer may withdraw such recommendation if the Buyer Board in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) determines
that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary
duties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, after consultation with the Company, the Buyer
may adjourn or postpone the Buyer Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus is provided
to the Buyer’s stockholders or, if as of the time for which
the Buyer Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus) there are
insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Buyer Stockholders Meeting. The Buyer, as
the sole stockholder of the Transitory Subsidiary, shall approve
this Agreement.

other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and

prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively
“Antitrust Laws”), to respond to any government
requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest
and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative
or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an
“Antitrust Order”) that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The Buyer
shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with
any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing,
provided that it shall afford the Company an opportunity to
fully participate therein as contemplated by this
Section 6.7. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, except as expressly provided in

under the Antitrust Laws) with respect to the Merger as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but not later than 15 business days)
after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary

A-39



material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act (or
pursuant to other Antitrust Laws). Each party will consult with
counsel for the other party as to, and will permit such counsel
to participate fully in, any litigation referred to in this
Section 6.7(b) and in Section 6.7(a)(iii) above. Each
party will (x) promptly notify the other party of any
written communication to that party from any Governmental Entity
located in the U.S. and, to the extent practicable, outside of
the U.S. and, subject to applicable law, if practicable, permit
the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate
the other party’s reasonable comments, (y) not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation
or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless, to
the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to
attend and (z) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them
and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one
hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its respective staff
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, except that any materials concerning the Buyer’s
valuation of the Company or the Company’s valuation of the
transaction may be redacted and internal financial information
of the Buyer may be provided to the Company’s counsel on an
outside counsel basis only.

(c)  If required to obtain clearances or approvals of
the Merger under Antitrust Laws, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall agree to: (i) a sale, transfer, license, separate
holding, divestiture or other disposition of or (ii) a
prohibition of, or a limitation on, the acquisition, ownership,
operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of
ownership of (the matters specified in clauses (i) and
(ii) a “Divestiture”), any asset or assets of the
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that
individually or in the aggregate would not be material in
relation to the continuing operations of the combined U.S.
businesses of the Company and the Buyer and their consolidated
Subsidiaries, but shall not be required to agree to any
Divestiture that is so material. Solely for purposes of this
Section 6.7(c), a Divestiture will be deemed material in
relation to the continuing operations of the combined U.S.
businesses of the Company and the Buyer and their consolidated
Subsidiaries if the Divestiture relates to assets that generated
in excess of $30 million of the total consolidated sales of the
Buyer and the Company in fiscal year 2000, but will be deemed
not to be material if the Divestiture relates to assets that
generated $30 million or less of the total consolidated sales of
the Buyer and the Company in fiscal year 2000.

(d)  Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices
to third parties, and use, and cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain any third party consents related to or required in
connection with the Merger that are (A) necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, or (C) required to prevent a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that
neither the Company nor the Buyer (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) shall be required to make any cash payments or
grant any concessions to third parties in connection with the
fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.7
(except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Section 6.7). The actions of each of the Buyer and the
Company with respect to the foregoing shall be reasonably
calculated to facilitate consummation of the Merger by the
Outside Date.

6.8  
Public Disclosure.
 Except as may be
required by law or stock market regulations, (i) the press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be
issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (ii) the Buyer and the Company
shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party before issuing any other press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger
or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to using such efforts.

6.9  
Reorganization.
 The Buyer and the Company
shall each use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization.

A-40



6.10  
Affiliate Agreements.
 Schedule 6.10
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of those
persons who are, in the Company’s reasonable judgment,
Rule 145 Affiliates of the Company. The Company shall
notify the Buyer in writing regarding any change in the identity
of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Buyer as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement (and in any case prior to the
mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus Company
Stockholder Meeting) from each of its Rule 145 Affiliates,
an executed Affiliate Agreement, in substantially the form
appended hereto as 
Exhibit D
 (the “Affiliate
Agreement”). The Buyer shall be entitled to place
appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any shares of
Buyer Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of
the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, subject
to the terms of the Stockholder’s Agreement, to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
the Buyer Common Stock (provided that such legends or stop
transfer instructions shall be removed, one year after the
Effective Time, upon the request of any holder of shares of
Buyer Common Stock issued in the Merger that is not then a
Rule 145 Affiliate of the Buyer).

6.11  
NYSE Listing.
 The Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be listed on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, on or prior to
the Closing Date.

6.12  
Employee Matters.

(a)  At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Stock Option under Company Stock Plans (other than the
Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“ESPP”)), whether vested or unvested, and the Company
Stock Plans (other than the ESPP), insofar as they relate to
outstanding Company Stock Options, shall be assumed by the Buyer
and shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, such
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole
number, at a price per share and rounded down to the nearest
whole cent equal to (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(z) the Exchange Ratio.

(b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall deliver to the participants in the Company Stock
Plans (other than the ESPP) appropriate notice setting forth
such participants’ rights pursuant thereto. All grants made
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP) shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 6.12 after giving
effect to the Merger).

(c)  The Buyer shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Company
Stock Plans (other than the ESPP) assumed in accordance with
this Section. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect
to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such options and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

(d)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall honor all Company Employee Plans (other than
the ESPP) in accordance with their terms as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that may be permitted by such terms. The Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
persons who are, immediately before the Effective Time,
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Company
Employees”) (i) in the case of Company Employees
employed in the United States, compensation and employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, not materially less
favorable than those provided by the Buyer to its similarly
situated employees and (ii) in the case of the Company
Employees employed outside the United States,

A-41



compensation and any employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, not materially less favorable than, at the option of
the Buyer, either (A) those provided by the Buyer to its
similarly situated employees or (B) those provided by the
Company to such non-U.S. Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The foregoing shall not be construed to
prevent (X) the termination of employment of any Company
Employee at any time after the Effective Time, (Y) the
amendment or termination of any Company Employee Plan at any
time after the Effective Time or (Z) during the period
beginning immediately after the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2001, the provision of benefits, other than
401(k) benefits, under Company Employee Plans as in existence
immediately before the Effective Time.

(e)  For all purposes under the employee benefit plans
of the Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New
Plans”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates
before the Effective Time for purposes of participation, vesting
and benefit levels where length of services is relevant to
benefit levels, but not for benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan or any accrual that would result in any duplication
of benefits, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Employee Plans, except to the extent
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
(other than the Buyer’s 401(k) plan) to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the “Old Plans”); and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, the Buyer shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and
his or her covered dependents, and the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on
the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
Company Employees who are participants in the Company’s
401(k) Plan immediately prior to the earlier of (i) the
termination of such Plan pursuant to Section 6.18 hereof or
(ii) the Closing, shall be eligible to participate in
Buyer’s 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably feasible after
the Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such
participation shall occur no later than 10 days after the
Closing, provided that the Company has given the Buyer such
access to the appropriate Company Employees as is reasonably
needed substantially to complete the enrollment process in the
Buyer’s 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing.

(f)  The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
immediately following the Effective Time, each of the
individuals listed in Section 6.12(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will have experienced “Good
Reason” within the meaning of the employment agreement
listed next to such individual’s name in
Section 6.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to be an
admission by the Company or the Buyer for any other purpose.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each such
individual shall be considered a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 6.12(f) with the right to enforce this
Section 6.12(f) against the Buyer.

(g)  The Company shall terminate the ESPP in
accordance with its terms immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the participants in the ESPP shall be permitted to
exercise any then outstanding options thereunder at such time.

6.13  
Stockholder Litigation.
 Until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms or the Effective Time, the Company shall afford the Buyer
the opportunity to participate, at its expense and with separate
counsel, in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or the Company Board relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by

A-42



this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without
the Buyer’s prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

6.14  
Representation on Buyer Board.
 The Buyer
shall take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to cause
the number of directors comprising the Buyer’s board of
directors at the Effective Time to be sufficient to permit
Alexis P. Michas to serve thereon (the “Stockholder
Designee”), and to cause the Stockholder Designee to be
elected to serve on the Buyer’s board of directors as
provided in the Stockholder’s Agreement.

6.15  
Indemnification.

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law for a period of
six years from the Effective Time, indemnify, hold harmless and
provide advancement of expense to, each present and former
director and officer of the Company (the “Indemnified
Parties”), against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
extent that such obligations to indemnify, hold harmless and
advance expenses exist under the DGCL, the Company’s
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or any contract binding
the Company and listed on Section 6.15(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule on the date of this Agreement.

(b)  For a period of six years after the Effective
Time, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy
covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been
made available to the Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement)
with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to such
persons as the Company’s existing coverage; provided, that
in no event shall the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage, which current
annual premium is set forth on Schedule 6.15(b) to this
Agreement.

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of the Indemnified Parties and the persons
referred to in clause (b) above shall be considered a
third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.15 with the right
to enforce this Section 6.15 against the Buyer.

6.16  
Notification of Certain Matters.
 The
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to give
reasonably prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to give reasonably
prompt notice to the Buyer, of the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would
be reasonably likely to result in (a) a breach of any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement or (b) the failure of any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such party under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the conditions to such party’s obligation to
consummate the Merger.

6.17  
Exemption from Liability Under
Section 16(b).

(a)  The board of directors of the Buyer, or a
committee thereof consisting solely of non-employee directors
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Company
Insiders of Buyer Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock, and of options to purchase Buyer Common Stock upon
assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the
extent such securities are listed in the Section 16

Company Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed
to be beneficially owned by each such Company Insider and
expected to be exchanged for Buyer Common Stock, and options to
purchase Buyer Common Stock, in each case, in connection with
the Merger, which shall be provided by the Company to the Buyer
within 10 business days after the date of this Agreement.

shall cause the Buyer’s 401(k) Plan to permit the Company
Employees to roll over their account balances from the

	representation or warranty was known by the Company to be false
	when made, or (y) resulting from a failure to satisfy the
	condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) based upon a material
	and knowing breach by the Company of its obligations under this
	Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to the
	Closing Date;

provided, however, that if a termination fee is payable by the

 Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may
be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void,

shall remain

liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement; and
provided further that such substitution does not prevent or

benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.6  
Severability.
 Any term or provision of

If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power
granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
valid and enforceable term or provision that shall achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes
of such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7  
Counterparts and Signature.
 This Agreement

parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may
be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission.

Interpretation.
 When reference is made in

reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement
shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter
forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include
the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state,
local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words
“include”, “includes” or
“including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words “without
limitation”. The mere inclusion of an item in the relevant
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation,
warranty or covenant shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has resulted or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.
No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
any other provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
the explicit intent of the parties hereto that no party is
making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and
instruments contemplated hereby to be delivered to the other
party), including any implied warranty or representation as to
condition, merchantability or suitability as to any of the

Company (or words of similar import), such knowledge shall refer
to the actual knowledge of the Company’s employees set
forth on Section 9.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. To
the extent that any representation or warranty is made to the
knowledge of the Buyer (or words of similar import), such
knowledge shall refer to the actual knowledge of the
Buyer’s employees set forth on Section 9.8 of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule.

9.9  
Governing Law.
 This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws
of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or

A-52



rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10  
Submission to Jurisdiction.
 Any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought exclusively in any federal or state court located in the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in Section 9.2 as to
giving notice hereunder shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

9.11  
Remedies.
 Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which the parties are entitled at law or in equity.

THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR

ANNEX B

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

July 13, 2001

Board of Directors

PerkinElmer, Inc.

45 Williams Street

Wellesley, MA 02481

Madam and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a
financial point of view to PerkinElmer, Inc.
(“PerkinElmer” or the “Company”) of the
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of July 13, 2001 (the
“Agreement”), among PerkinElmer, Inc., Pablo
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PerkinElmer
(“Transitory Subsidiary”), and Packard BioScience
Company (“Packard”). Pursuant to the Agreement,
Transitory Subsidiary will be merged with Packard and each share
of outstanding Common Stock, par value $.002 per share (the
“Shares”), of Packard will be converted into the right
to receive 0.311 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per
share (the “Company Common Stock”), of PerkinElmer
(the “Exchange Ratio”).

Goldman, Sachs & Co., as part of its investment banking
business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and
other purposes. We are familiar with the Company having provided
certain investment banking services to the Company from time to
time, including having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with its acquisition of Perkin-Elmer’s
Analytical Instruments Business in June 1999 and its
divestiture of EG&G’s Technical Services business in
August 1999; having acted as lead managing underwriter with
respect to the sale of $400,000,000 Zero Coupon Convertible
Notes of the Company in August 2000; and having acted as
its financial advisor in connection with, and having
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
Agreement. Goldman, Sachs & Co. provides a full range of
financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of
its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect
transactions and hold securities including, derivative
securities, of the Company or Packard for its own account and
for the accounts of customers.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other
things, the Agreement; the Registration Statement on
Form S-1, including the Prospectus dated April 20,
2000 contained therein, relating to Packard’s initial
public offering of Shares; Annual Reports to Stockholders and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the four
years ended December 31, 2000, and of Packard for the year
ended December 31, 2000; certain interim reports to
stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the
Company and Packard; certain other communications from the
Company and Packard to their

B-1

respective stockholders; certain internal financial analyses and
forecasts for Packard prepared by its management; and certain
internal financial analyses and forecasts for Packard and the
Company prepared by the Company’s management (the
“Forecasts”), including certain cost savings and
revenue and operating synergies projected by the management of
the Company to result from the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement (the “Synergies”). We also have held
discussions with members of the senior management of the Company
regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and
the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement and with members of the senior management of the
Company and Packard regarding the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of their
respective companies. In addition, we have reviewed the reported
price and trading activity for the Shares and the Company Common
Stock, compared certain financial and stock market information
for Packard and the Company with similar information for certain
other companies the securities of which are publicly traded,
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the life science industry specifically and in
other industries generally and performed such other studies and
analyses as we considered appropriate.

We have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or
reviewed by us and have assumed such accuracy and completeness
for purposes of rendering this opinion. In that regard, we have
assumed, with your consent, that the Forecasts, including the
Synergies, prepared by the management of the Company have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the Company, and that such
Forecasts and Synergies will be realized in the amounts and time
periods contemplated thereby. In addition, we have not made an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities of Packard or the Company or any of their
subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We also have assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by the Agreement will be obtained without any adverse effect on
the Company or Packard or on the contemplated benefits of the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement. Our advisory services
and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the
information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the
Company in connection with its consideration of the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement and such opinion does not
constitute a recommendation as to how holders of the Company
Common Stock should vote with respect to such transaction.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such
other matters, as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that
as of the date hereof the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the
Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to PerkinElmer.

ANNEX C

July 13, 2001

The Board of Directors

Packard BioScience Company

800 Research Parkway

Meriden, Connecticut 06450

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par
value $0.002 per share (the “Company Common Stock”),
of Packard BioScience Company (the “Company”) of the
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) in the proposed merger (the
“Merger”) of the Company with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PerkinElmer, Inc. (the “Merger
Partner”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Agreement”), dated as of July 13, 2001,
among the Company, the Merger Partner and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Merger Partner , the Company will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Merger Partner, and each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of
Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by any wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company or by the Merger Partner or any
wholly owned subsidiary of the Merger Partner, will be converted
into the right to receive .311 shares (the “Exchange
Ratio”) of the Merger Partner’s common stock, par
value $1.00 per share (the “Merger Partner Common
Stock”).

In arriving at our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the
Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information concerning the Company and
the Merger Partner and the industries in which they operate;
(iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger
with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the
consideration received for such companies; (iv) compared
the financial and operating performance of the Company and the
Merger Partner with publicly available information concerning
certain other companies we deemed relevant; (v) reviewed
the current and historical market prices of the Company Common
Stock and the Merger Partner Common Stock and certain publicly
traded securities of such other companies; (vi) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
the managements of the Company and the Merger Partner relating
to their respective businesses , as well as the estimated amount
and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and
synergies that the Company expects to result from the Merger
(the “Synergies”); and (vii) performed such other
financial studies and analyses and considered such other
information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion.

In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of
the management of the Company and the Merger Partner with
respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and
current business operations of the Company and the Merger
Partner, the financial condition and future prospects and
operations of the Company and the Merger Partner, the effects of
the Merger on the financial condition and future prospects of
the Company and the Merger Partner, and certain other matters we
believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished to us
by the Company and the Merger Partner or otherwise reviewed by
us, and we have not assumed any responsibility or liability
therefor. We have not conducted any valuation or appraisal of
any assets or liabilities, nor have any such valuations or
appraisals been provided to us. In relying on financial analyses
and forecasts provided to us, including the Synergies provided
by the Company, we have assumed that they have been reasonably
prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently
available estimates

C-1



and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of the Company and the Merger
Partner to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We have also
assumed that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes,
and that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement.
We have relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering our
opinion upon the advice of counsel. We have further assumed that
all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or the Merger
Partner or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do
not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this
opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common
Stock of the Exchange Ratio in the proposed Merger and we
express no opinion as to the underlying decision by the Company
to engage in the Merger. We are expressing no opinion herein as
to the price at which the Company Common Stock or the Merger
Partner Common Stock will trade at any future time.

We note that we were not authorized to and did not solicit any
expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to
the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other
alternative transaction.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect
to the proposed Merger and will receive a fee from the Company
for our services if the proposed Merger is consummated. We and
our affiliates, in the ordinary course of business, have from
time to time provided investment banking and commercial banking
services to the Company and the Merger Partner, respectively,
for which we received usual and customary compensation, and in
the future may continue to provide such services. In the
ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may
actively trade the debt and equity securities of the Company or
the Merger Partner for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or
short positions in such securities.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion
as of the date hereof that the Exchange Ratio in the proposed
Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of the Company Common Stock.

This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company
in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
Merger. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should
vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. This
opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in
whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever
except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be
reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed
to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be
disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written
approval.

	Very truly yours,

	J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 
“Merger
Agreement”
) that provides for the merger (the

“Merger”
) of Acquisition Sub with and into
Packard. Pursuant to the Merger, shares of capital stock of
Packard will be converted into the right to receive shares of
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of PerkinElmer

(“PerkinElmer Common Stock”)
.

B.  The Stockholder is party to a Stockholders’
Agreement, dated as of March 4, 1997, among Packard, the
Stockholder and certain other stockholders of Packard, as
amended on June 2, 1997, January 23, 1998 and
March 31, 1998 (the

share, of Packard that the Stockholder (i) owns
beneficially and of record and has the sole power to vote (the

“Owned Shares”
) and (ii) has, pursuant to
the 1997 Agreement, the contractual power to direct the vote
(the 
“1997 Agreement Shares”
), in each case,
with respect to the matters specified in Section 1.3 of
this Agreement. The Owned Shares and the 1997 Agreement Shares
are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the

“Shares”
. For purposes of this Agreement,
“beneficial ownership” shall have the meaning given to
such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the 
“Exchange Act”
).

D.  PerkinElmer desires the Stockholder to agree, and
the Stockholder is willing to agree, to (i) restrictions as
to the transfer of the Shares and (ii) the voting of the
Shares, in each case, as set forth herein.

E.  PerkinElmer and the Stockholder also desire to
provide for certain arrangements with respect to, among other
things, (i) the nomination to PerkinElmer’s Board of
Directors (the 
“PerkinElmer Board”
) effective
as of the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of
a person designated by the Stockholder and (ii) the
registration of shares of PerkinElmer Common Stock to be issued
to the Stockholder in the Merger (and any securities issued or
issuable in respect thereof by way of a dividend or stock split
or in connection with a combination of shares or
recapitalization) (the 
“Merger Shares”
) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
“Securities
Act”
).

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree
as follows:

relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date. As
used herein, the term 
“Expiration Date” 
shall
mean the earliest to occur of: (i) the Effective Time
(provided that if the Stockholder is a signatory to an Affiliate
Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Packard,
nothing contained herein shall release the Stockholder from any
of its obligations set forth under such Affiliate Agreement),
(ii) such date and time as the Board of Directors of
Packard withdraws or

with its terms.

1.2  
Additional Purchases.

terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if
they constituted Shares.

direct the vote of the Shares or any New Shares as herein
provided and to otherwise comply with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

1.8  
Termination. 
Section 1 of this
Agreement and the Proxy delivered in connection herewith shall

“Stockholder Designee”
) for nomination to the
PerkinElmer Board effective as of the Effective Time and at each
annual meeting of stockholders of PerkinElmer, as the case may
be, at which directors are to be elected. With respect to each
such annual meeting, the Stockholder shall make such designation
by delivering written notice (the 
“Designation
Notice”
) of the identity of such person within
10 days of receipt of a written request from PerkinElmer
soliciting such designation (which request shall be sent not
earlier than 90 days prior to such annual meeting). The
PerkinElmer Board shall, subject to its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, cause such Stockholder Designee to be nominated
and recommended for election to the PerkinElmer Board at such
annual meeting of stockholders of PerkinElmer. The initial
Stockholder Designee to serve on the PerkinElmer Board effective
as of the Effective Time of the Merger shall be Alexis P. Michas.

2.2  The rights granted to the Stockholder and the
obligations of PerkinElmer pursuant to this Section 2 shall
terminate on the date on which the Stockholder ceases, following
the Effective Time, to beneficially own 5% or more of the
outstanding shares of PerkinElmer Common Stock.

3.  
Registration Rights. 
The Stockholder shall
be entitled to the registration rights set forth in this
Section 3 with respect to the Merger Shares.

3.1  
Required Registration.

(a).  As promptly as reasonably practicable (but not
later than 30 days) following the Effective Time,
PerkinElmer shall file with the SEC a “shelf”
registration statement on Form S-3 (or such successor or
other appropriate form) covering the resale to the public by the
Stockholder of the Merger Shares pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act (the 
“Stockholder Registration
Statement”
).

D-3



PerkinElmer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Stockholder Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the SEC as soon as practicable. PerkinElmer shall cause the
Stockholder Registration Statement to remain effective until the
earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which all of the
Merger Shares covered by the Stockholder Registration Statement
have been sold pursuant thereto and (ii) the date on which
PerkinElmer’s obligations under this Section 3 shall
terminate in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.6
hereof.

(b)  PerkinElmer will use its reasonable best efforts
to qualify all Merger Shares under any applicable state
securities laws; 
provided, however
, that PerkinElmer
shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or
execute a general consent to service of process in any
jurisdiction.

(c)  From time to time, PerkinElmer will amend or
supplement the Stockholder Registration Statement and any
prospectus contained therein to the extent necessary to comply
with the Securities Act and any applicable state securities
laws. PerkinElmer will also promptly provide the Stockholder
with as many copies of the prospectus contained in the
Stockholder Registration Statement as the Stockholder may
reasonably request.

(d)  PerkinElmer shall be entitled to:
(i) postpone the filing or effectiveness of the Stockholder
Registration Statement or (ii) if effective, elect that the
Stockholder Registration Statement not be usable and require the
Stockholder to suspend sales or purchases pursuant to any
prospectus contained therein, for a reasonable period of time,
but not in excess of 90 days in the aggregate as to all
postponements and suspensions pursuant to clauses (i) and
(ii) above in any 12-month period if PerkinElmer determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
registration and distribution of the Merger Shares (or the use
of the Stockholder Registration Statement or any related
prospectus) would interfere with any pending material
acquisition, material corporate reorganization or other material
corporate development involving PerkinElmer, including by
requiring premature disclosure thereof; provided that, in the
event of such postponement or suspension, PerkinElmer shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions
necessary or desirable to, immediately thereafter, give full
effect to the Stockholder’s rights under this
Section 3. PerkinElmer shall promptly give the Stockholder
written notice of such determination and an approximation of the
anticipated delay.

(e)  If the Stockholder desires to effect the sale and
distribution of some or all of the Merger Shares covered by the
Stockholder Registration Statement by means of an underwriting,
it shall so advise PerkinElmer, and PerkinElmer and the
Stockholder shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form (including customary indemnification and
contribution provisions on the part of PerkinElmer) for such
purpose and shall otherwise cooperate reasonably with respect to
such underwriting. The underwriter(s) shall be selected by the
Stockholder and shall be reasonably acceptable to PerkinElmer.
The Stockholder will enter into a power of attorney and custody
agreement (naming officers of PerkinElmer as attorneys-in-fact
and PerkinElmer as custodian) in customary form with respect to
the Merger Shares to be sold and distributed in such
underwriting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PerkinElmer shall
not be required to enter into more than two underwriting
agreements in connection with the Stockholder Registration
Statement and not more than one underwriting agreement in any
12-month period, provided that PerkinElmer’s obligation to
enter into a second underwriting agreement shall be further
subject to the condition that such second underwriting agreement
covers the sale of two percent or more of the number of shares
of PerkinElmer Common Stock then outstanding.

3.2  
Incidental Registration.

(a)  If, prior to July 13, 2004, PerkinElmer
proposes to file a registration statement (other than a
registration statement filed pursuant to Section 3.1 or a
registration statement on Form S-8 or Form S-4, or
their successors, or any other form for a similar limited
purpose, or any registration statement covering only securities
proposed to be issued in exchange for securities or assets of
another corporation) for a primary offering and sale of shares
of PerkinElmer Common Stock by PerkinElmer or an offering and
sale of shares of PerkinElmer Common Stock by PerkinElmer and
one or more selling stockholders, in each case, that is to be
underwritten on a firm commitment or best efforts basis (a

“Company Registration Statement”
), it will,
prior to such filing, give written notice to the Stockholder of
its intention to do so at

D-4



least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date of such
Company Registration Statement; provided, that PerkinElmer shall
not be required to give any notice if the Company Registration
Statement is underwritten and the underwriter(s) thereof shall
have advised PerkinElmer in writing that no securities, other
than those to be sold by PerkinElmer, may be included therein.
PerkinElmer’s written notice shall offer to include in such
registration statement for offer to the public such number of
Merger Shares as the Stockholder may request, subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and shall specify, to the extent
then known, the number and class and securities proposed to be
registered, the proposed date of filing of such registration
statement, any proposed means of distribution of such
securities, any proposed managing underwriter or underwriters of
such securities and (if available or as soon as available) a
good faith estimate (which may be a range) by PerkinElmer of the
proposed maximum offering price of such securities, as such
price is proposed to appear on the facing page of such
registration statement. Upon the written request of the
Stockholder to PerkinElmer given within 10 days after
PerkinElmer provides such notice, PerkinElmer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all Merger Shares which
PerkinElmer has been requested by the Stockholder to register to
be included in such Company Registration Statement. PerkinElmer
shall have the right to postpone, suspend or withdraw any
Company Registration Statement without obligation to the
Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Stockholder shall have no right to include any
Merger Shares in any primary offering and sale of shares of
PerkinElmer Common Stock by PerkinElmer that is made pursuant to
a “shelf” registration statement pursuant to
Rule 415 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Act.

(b)  The right of the Stockholder to include its
Merger Shares in any Company Registration Statement shall be
conditioned upon the Stockholder’s participation in the
underwriting for such Company Registration Statement on the
terms set forth herein. The Stockholder shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for the underwriting by PerkinElmer.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.2, if
the managing underwriter advises PerkinElmer in writing that in
its opinion the inclusion of all shares requested to be
registered by PerkinElmer and any selling stockholders
(including the Stockholder) would adversely affect the offering,
PerkinElmer may limit the number of Merger Shares to be included
in the Company Registration Statement and underwriting. In such
event, PerkinElmer shall so advise the Stockholder, and the
number of shares that are entitled to be included in the Company
Registration Statement and underwriting shall be allocated in
the following manner:

	(i)  First, the securities of PerkinElmer to be issued
	by PerkinElmer shall be included in the Company Registration
	Statement.

	(ii)  Second, the securities of PerkinElmer held by
	the Stockholder and other holders of securities of PerkinElmer
	who are entitled, by contract with PerkinElmer, to have
	securities included in such a registration statement shall be
	included in the Company Registration Statement, on a pro rata
	basis based upon the number of securities of PerkinElmer
	requested by the Stockholder and such other holders to be
	included in such Company Registration Statement.

3.3  
Expenses. 
PerkinElmer shall pay the
expenses incurred by it in complying with its obligations under
this Section 3, including all registration and filing fees,
exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel for
PerkinElmer, and fees and expenses of accountants for
PerkinElmer, but excluding: (i) any brokerage fees, selling
commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the
Stockholder in connection with sales under the registration
statement and (ii) the fees and expenses of any counsel
separately retained by the Stockholder.

3.4  
Requirements of the Stockholder.

(a)  PerkinElmer shall not be required to include any
Merger Shares in any registration statement under this
Section 3 unless: the Stockholder furnishes to PerkinElmer
in writing such information reasonably requested by PerkinElmer
for inclusion in or in connection with such registration
statement and any such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

D-5



(b)  The Stockholder shall keep PerkinElmer reasonably
apprised as to sales made by the Stockholder pursuant to any
registration statement under this Section 3. PerkinElmer
shall keep the Stockholder reasonably apprised as to changes in
the number of shares of PerkinElmer Common Stock outstanding.

3.5  
Indemnification.

(a)  The Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless PerkinElmer and each of its directors and officers, and
each person, if any, who controls PerkinElmer within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities (including reasonable attorney’s fees) to
which PerkinElmer or such directors, officers or persons may
become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any registration statement filed pursuant to
this Section 3 or any omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, which statement or omission
was made in reliance upon, or in conformity with, information
furnished to PerkinElmer by or on behalf of the Stockholder
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) expressly for use therein
(provided that any indemnification obligation of the Stockholder
shall be limited to the amount of net proceeds, after deducting
the fees set forth in Section 3.3(i), received by the
Stockholder from the sale of Merger Shares pursuant to such
registration statement).

(b)  PerkinElmer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Stockholder and each of its directors and officers, and each
person, if any, who controls the Stockholder within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities (including reasonable attorney’s fees) to
which the Stockholder or such directors, officers or persons may
become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any registration statement filed pursuant to
this Section 3 or any omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or
are based upon information furnished to PerkinElmer by or on
behalf of the Stockholder pursuant to Section 3.4.

the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which
PerkinElmer may be responsible for indemnification under this

PerkinElmer Common Stock and (ii) such time as the
Stockholder is able to sell all of the Merger Shares without any

the outstanding shares of PerkinElmer Common Stock in any
90 day period, whether any such transaction described is to

of time as PerkinElmer’s officers and directors agree to be
locked up) following the effective date of such registration
statement and shall execute the managing underwriter’s
customary lock-up agreement for such purpose; 
provided
,
that all officers and directors of PerkinElmer enter into
similar agreements. PerkinElmer may impose stop-transfer
instructions with respect to the Merger Shares or other
securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of
such 90-day (or shorter) period.

“Agreement”
) is made and entered into as of
July 13, 2001, between PerkinElmer, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation

Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 
“Merger
Agreement”
) that provides for the merger (the

“Merger”
) of Acquisition Sub with and into
Packard. Pursuant to the Merger, shares of capital stock of
Packard will be converted into the right to receive shares of
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of PerkinElmer

(“PerkinElmer Common Stock”)
.

B.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
certain other stockholders of Packard (the 
“Packard

) are entering into
Voting Agreements with PerkinElmer containing substantially
similar terms as this Agreement, and Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. 
(“Stonington”)
 is
entering into a Stockholder’s Agreement with PerkinElmer
(collectively, the 
“Packard Voting
Agreements”
). For purposes of this Agreement the
Packard Voting Agreement Stockholders and Stonington are
sometimes collectively referred to as the 
“Packard
Stockholders”
.

C.  Attached hereto as Schedule A is a list of
the shares of outstanding common stock, $0.002 par value per
share, of Packard that the Stockholder owns beneficially and of
record and has the sole power to vote or direct the vote (the

“Shares”

“beneficial ownership” shall have the meaning given to
such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the 
“Exchange Act”
).

D.  PerkinElmer desires the Stockholder to agree, and
the Stockholder is willing to agree:

	(i)  not to transfer, consent to the transfer or
	otherwise dispose of the Shares; and

Expiration Date. As used herein, the term 
“Expiration
Date”
 shall mean the earliest to occur of: (i) the
date on which the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) shall have been obtained (provided that if
the Stockholder is a signatory to an Affiliate Agreement (as

set forth under such Affiliate Agreement), (ii) such date
and time as the Board of Directors of Packard withdraws or
knowingly modifies in a material adverse manner its
recommendation of the Merger in accordance with
Section 6.1(b)(i) of the Merger Agreement and
(iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder
may Transfer some or all of the Shares so long as, after giving
effect to such Transfer, the number of Shares held by the
Stockholder and subject to this Agreement, together with all
shares of Packard common stock subject to the Packard Voting
Agreements and held by the Packard Stockholders, equals or

PART II

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20.  
Indemnification of Directors and
Officers.

Section 67 of Chapter 156B of the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as amended (the
“Massachusetts Business Corporation Law”), and
Article V, Section 9 of the Registrant’s by-laws,
to which reference is hereby made, contain provisions
authorizing indemnification by the Registrant of directors,
officers, employees or agents against certain liabilities and
expenses, which they may incur as directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Registrant or of certain other entities.
Section 67 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law provides that the indemnification of
directors, officers, employees and agents of a corporation and
persons who serve at the corporation’s request as
directors, officers, employees and other agents of another
organization may be provided to whatever extent as shall be
specified by (i) the articles of organization of the
corporation or (ii) a by-law adopted by the stockholders or
(iii) a vote adopted by the holders of a majority of the
shares of stock entitled to vote on the election of directors.
Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or the
by-laws, the indemnification of any persons described above who
are not directors of the corporation may be provided by the
corporation to the extent authorized by the directors. Such
indemnification may include payment by the corporation of
expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or
proceeding prior to the final disposition of such action or
proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnified
person to repay such payment if he shall be adjudicated to be
not entitled to indemnification under Section 67 of
Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Law.
Any indemnification may be provided although the person to be
indemnified is no longer an officer, director, employee or agent
of the corporation or of such other organization.
Indemnification may not be provided for any person with respect
to any matter as to which that person shall have been
adjudicated in any proceeding to not have acted in good faith in
the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interest
of the corporation.

Section 65 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law provides a limitation on the imposition
of liability under other sections of the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Law. Under this section, a director, officer or
incorporator of a corporation is to perform his duties in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best
interests of the corporation and with such care as an ordinarily
prudent person in a like position would use under similar
circumstances. Such director, officer or incorporator is
entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or records,
including financial statements, books of accounts and other
financial records, which are prepared by or presented by or
under the supervision of (i) one or more officers or
employees of the corporation whom the director, officer or
incorporator reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in
the matters presented, or (ii) counsel, public accountants
or other persons as to matters that the director, officer or
incorporator reasonably believes to be within such a
person’s professional expert competence, or (iii) in
the case of a director, a duly constituted committee of the
board of directors upon which he does not serve, as to matters
within its delegated authority, which committee the director
reasonably believes to merit confidence. If a director, officer
or incorporator performs his duties in the manner that is set
forth above, that fact shall be an absolute defense to any claim
asserted against him except as expressly provided by statute.

Section 13 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law provides that the articles of
organization of a corporation may contain a provision
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to
the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of a fiduciary duty as a director notwithstanding any
provision of law imposing such liability; provided, however,
that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability
of a director (i) for any breach of the director’s
duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders,
(ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(iii) under Sections 61 or 62 of Chapter 156B of
the Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit. Article Six of the Restated Articles of
Organization of the Registrant, as amended, contains a provision
consistent with Section 13 of Chapter 156B of the
Massachusetts Business

II-1



Corporation Law and provides that to the fullest extent
permitted by the Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, a
director of the Registrant shall not be personally liable to the
Registrant or its stockholder for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of
law imposing such liability.

Section 9 of Article V of the By-Laws of the
Registrant contains provisions relating to the indemnification
of directors and officers of the Registrant, which are
consistent with Section 67 of Chapter 156B of the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law. This section provides
that no indemnification will be provided to any person who was
or is a director or officer with respect to any matter as to
which such person shall have been finally adjudicated in any
proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable
belief that his action was in the best interest of the
corporation; nor shall indemnification be provided where the
corporation is required or has undertaken to submit to a court
the question of whether or not indemnification by it is against
public policy and it has been finally determined that such
indemnification is against public policy; provided, however,
that, prior to such final adjudication, the corporation may
compromise and settle any such claims and liabilities and pay
such expenses, if such settlement or payment, or both, appears,
in the judgment of a majority of those members of the board of
directors who are not directly involved in such matters, to be
in the best interest of the corporation as evidenced by a
resolution to that effect adopted after receipt by the
corporation of a written opinion of counsel for the corporation
that, based upon the facts available to such counsel such person
has not acted in a manner that would prohibit indemnification.

Section 67 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law also contains provisions authorizing a
corporation to obtain insurance on behalf of any director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation against
liabilities, whether or not the corporation would have the power
to indemnify against such liabilities. The Registrant maintains
director and officer liability and company reimbursement
liability insurance. Subject to certain deductibles, such
insurance will pay up to $50,000,000 per year on claims or
errors and omissions against the Registrant’s directors and
officers and will reimburse the Registrant for amounts paid to
indemnify directors and officers against the costs of such
claims pursuant to the Registrant’s by-laws.

Item 22.  
Undertakings.

A.  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

	(1)  To file, during any period in which offers or sales
	are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration
	statement:

	(i)  To include any prospectus required by
	Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;

	(ii)  To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events
	arising after the effective date of the registration statement
	(or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,
	individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change
	in the information set forth in the registration statement.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in
	volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
	securities offered would not exceed that which was registered)
	and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated
	maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of
	prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to
	Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and
	price represent no more than 20 percent change in the
	maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the
	“Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the
	effective registration statement;

	(iii)  To include any material information with respect to
	the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the
	registration statement or any material change to such
	information in the registration statement.

II-3



	(2)  That, for the purpose of determining any liability
	under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective
	amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
	such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
	initial
 bona fide
 offering thereof.

	(3)  To remove from registration by means of a
	post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered
	which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.

B.  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for
purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act
of 1933, each filing of the registrant’s annual report
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an
employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), that
is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall
be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered herein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide

offering thereof.

C.  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as
follows: that prior to any public reoffering of the securities
registered hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part
of this registration statement, by any person or party who is
deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of
Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such reoffering
prospectus will contain the information called for by the
applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by
persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the
information called for by the other items of the applicable form.

D.  The undersigned registrant undertakes that every
prospectus: (i) that is filed pursuant to paragraph
(1) immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to
meet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is
used in connection with an offering of securities subject to
Rule 415, will be filed as a part of an amendment to the
registration statement and will not be used until such amendment
is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any
liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide 
offering thereof.

E.  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors,
officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to
the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been
advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling
person in connection with the securities being registered, the
registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in
the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

F.  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond
to requests for information that is incorporated by reference
into the prospectus pursuant to Item 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of
this form, within one business day of receipt of such request,
and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or
other equally prompt means. This includes information contained
in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of this
registration statement through the date of responding to the
request.

G.  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply
by means of a post-effective amendment all information
concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired
involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in
the registration statement when it became effective.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  Reference is made to Amendment No. 1 to the Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") of PerkinElmer, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation ("PerkinElmer"), relating to the merger (the "Merger")
of Pablo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of PerkinElmer ("Merger Sub"), with and into Packard BioScience Company, a
Delaware corporation ("Packard BioScience"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger by and among PerkinElmer, Merger Sub and Packard BioScience dated as
of July 13, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement").

                  We have participated in the preparation of the discussion set
forth in the section entitled "THE MERGER -- Material United States Federal
Income Tax Considerations" in the Registration Statement. In our opinion,
provided that the Merger is undertaken pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, such discussion, insofar as it describes the United States federal
income tax consequences of the Merger, is accurate in all material respects.

                  We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement,
and to the references therein to us. In giving such consent, we do not thereby
admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under
Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and
we do not thereby deem ourselves experts within the meaning of Section 11 of the
Securities Act.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        /s/ Hale and Dorr LLP
