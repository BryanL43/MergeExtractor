Dear PerkinElmer Stockholder:

I am writing to ask for your support of our proposed acquisition
of Packard BioScience Company. We believe the acquisition of
Packard BioScience will significantly strengthen our Life
Sciences business, one of our most important growth
opportunities.

In order to complete the proposed merger, PerkinElmer

This transaction is in the form of a merger of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PerkinElmer with and into Packard BioScience. In
the merger, each share of Packard BioScience common stock will
be converted into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock. PerkinElmer expects to issue
approximately 21,342,549 shares of its common stock in the
merger. Upon completion of the merger, Packard BioScience
stockholders will own approximately [  ]% of
PerkinElmers outstanding common stock. PerkinElmer common
stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading
symbol PKI and closed at a price of
$[     ] per share on
[          ],
2001. PerkinElmer stockholders will continue to own their
existing PerkinElmer shares after the merger.

The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus provides
detailed information about PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and
the merger. Please give all of this information your careful
attention. In particular, you should carefully consider the
discussion in the section entitled Risk Factors
beginning on page 9 of the joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares
you own. To vote your shares, you may use the enclosed proxy
card or attend the special meeting, which will be held on
               .
 To approve the proposal submitted to you, you must vote
FOR the proposal by following the instructions

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  Why do the companies propose to merge?

A:

	PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience believe that the merger will
	provide several benefits to both companies, including:

      

	a broader range of products and services for drug discovery
	customers;

      

	a good strategic fit between the companies;

      

	providing the combined company with a growing position in the
	life sciences research and drug discovery tools business;

      

	enabling the combined company to offer the full spectrum of drug
	discovery tools supported by a broad and focused worldwide
	sales, service and applications capability; and

      

	combining PerkinElmers instrumentation and reagent depth
	with Packard BioSciences strength in liquid handling and
	automated sample preparation products.

Q:  What will Packard BioScience stockholders
receive in the merger?

A:

	If the merger is completed, Packard BioScience stockholders will
	receive 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common stock for each
	share of Packard BioScience common stock that they own and cash,
	without interest, for any fractional shares.

Q:

When do you expect to complete the merger of PerkinElmer and
	Packard BioScience?

A:

	We expect to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of
	2001, but neither PerkinElmer nor Packard BioScience can predict
	the exact timing.

Q:

Do the Boards of Directors of PerkinElmer and Packard
	BioScience recommend approval of the proposals?

A:

	Yes. For a more complete description of the recommendation of
	the Packard BioScience board of directors, see the sections
	entitled The Merger  Packard BioSciences
	Reasons for the Merger and
	 Recommendation of Packard BioSciences
	Board of Directors.

For a more complete description of the recommendation of the
PerkinElmer board of directors, see the sections entitled
The Merger  PerkinElmers Reasons for the
Merger and  Recommendation of the
PerkinElmer Board of Directors.

Q:

Who must approve the merger?

A:

	In addition to the approvals of the boards of directors of
	PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience, which were already obtained,
	PerkinElmer stockholders must approve the issuance of
	PerkinElmer common stock in the merger and Packard BioScience
	stockholders must adopt the merger agreement.

Q:

What vote of PerkinElmer stockholders is required to approve
	the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in the merger?

A:

	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
	the shares of PerkinElmer common stock present or represented by
	proxy at the PerkinElmer special meeting is required to approve
	the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the
	merger.

Q:

What vote of Packard BioScience stockholders is required to
	adopt the merger agreement?

A:

	The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
	the outstanding shares of Packard BioScience common stock is
	required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
	merger. Stonington Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. and
	other stockholders of Packard BioScience have agreed, with
	respect to a total of 34,397,355 shares of Packard BioScience
	common stock, to vote, or in the case of shares over which they
	have the power to direct the vote, to direct the vote of, such

	knowingly modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation
	of



	the merger in response to a superior acquisition proposal in
	accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, the merger
	agreement. These shares represented
	     % of the outstanding shares of
	Packard BioScience common stock on
	            ,
	 2001, the record date for the special meeting of Packard
	BioScience stockholders.

Q:

What do I need to do now?

A:

	PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience urge you to carefully read
	this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes and
	to consider how the merger will affect you as a stockholder. You
	also may want to review the documents referenced under the
	section entitled Where You Can Find More Information.

Q:

How do I vote?

A:

	You may indicate how you want to vote on your proxy card. You
	may also attend your stockholder meeting and vote in person
	instead of submitting a proxy. 
If you are a Packard
	BioScience stockholder and fail either to return your proxy card
	or to vote in person at the stockholder meeting, or if you mark
	your proxy abstain, the effect will be a vote
	against the merger. 
If you fail to indicate your vote on
	your proxy, your proxy will be counted as a vote for all
	proposals submitted to you, unless your shares are held in a
	brokerage account.

Q:

If my shares are held in a brokerage account, will my broker
	vote my shares for me?

A:

	Your broker cannot vote your shares on the proposals relating to
	the merger agreement without instructions from you on how to
	vote. Therefore, it is important that you follow the directions
	provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
	vote your shares. 
If you are a Packard BioScience stockholder
	and fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will have
	the same effect as a vote against the merger.

Q:

May I change my vote after I have mailed in my signed proxy
	card?

A:

	You may change your vote at any time before the vote takes place
	at your stockholder meeting. To change your vote, you may either
	submit a later dated proxy card or send a written notice stating
	that you would like to revoke your proxy. In addition, you may
	attend your stockholder meeting and vote in person. However, if
	you elect to vote in person at your stockholder meeting and your
	shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must
	bring to the stockholder meeting a legal proxy from the broker,
	bank or other nominee authorizing you to vote the shares.

Q:

Where and when is the PerkinElmer stockholder meeting?

A:

	The special meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders will be held at
	               a.m.,
	 local time, on
	               ,

	Connecticut.

	certificates now?

	merger, PerkinElmers transfer agent will send instructions
	to Packard BioScience stockholders regarding the exchange of
	shares of Packard BioScience common stock for PerkinElmer common

(Page 56)

Pursuant to the merger agreement, PerkinElmer will assume all
outstanding options to purchase shares of Packard BioScience
common stock. Each option to purchase shares of Packard
BioScience common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will become an option to acquire,
on the same terms, 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common stock,
with the option exercise price to be adjusted accordingly. In
connection with the merger, all outstanding options to purchase
shares of Packard BioScience common stock will vest in full.



Conditions to the Merger

(Page 64)

The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction of a
number of mutual and nonmutual conditions, including:

 

	Packard BioScience stockholders must have adopted the merger
	agreement;

 

	PerkinElmer stockholders must have approved the issuance of
	PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger;

 

	the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of PerkinElmer common
	stock that will be issued to Packard BioScience stockholders in
	the merger must have been approved;

	the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint
	proxy statement/prospectus is a part, must have become effective
	and not be the subject of a stop order, and no proceedings
	seeking a stop order must have been threatened or initiated;

 

	the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
	Improvements Act of 1976 must have expired or been terminated;
	and

 

	other customary conditions specified in the merger agreement.

The party entitled to assert any condition to the merger may
waive the condition.

No Solicitation by Packard BioScience

(Page 60)

Packard BioScience has agreed that until termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms neither it nor any
of its subsidiaries or representatives will:

 

	solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any proposal from a
	third party that might lead to an acquisition proposal for
	Packard BioScience, including approving any person becoming an
	interested stockholder under the business combination with
	interested stockholder provision of Delaware law; or

 

	enter into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide
	any information to a third party with respect to, an acquisition
	proposal.

However, Packard BioScience may furnish information to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, a third party
relating to an acquisition proposal that the Packard BioScience
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, is reasonably
likely to result in a superior proposal.

In addition, the Packard BioScience board of directors has
agreed that neither it nor any of its committees will withdraw
or knowingly modify in any material adverse manner its
recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger, cause or
permit Packard BioScience to enter into any agreement relating
to an alternative acquisition proposal or adopt, approve or
recommend an alternative acquisition proposal. However, the
Packard BioScience board of directors may withdraw or knowingly
modify in any material adverse manner its or any
committees approval or recommendation if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors, that the third partys acquisition
proposal is a superior proposal, and may adopt, approve or
recommend such superior proposal if:

 

	Packard BioScience intends to enter into a binding written
	agreement to consummate the superior proposal;

 

	Packard BioScience complies with the notice and other procedural
	requirements set forth in the merger agreement;



 

	PerkinElmer does not, in the time allowed by the merger
	agreement, match the superior proposal; and

 

	Packard BioScience pays to PerkinElmer a termination fee of
	$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement.

Packard BioScience is not prohibited from taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer or
from making other disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Packard BioScience board of directors,
based on advice from its outside legal counsel, failure to
disclose would be inconsistent with its legal obligations.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

(Page 66)

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience can mutually agree to
terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. In
addition, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience can each terminate
the merger agreement under the circumstances set forth in the
merger agreement and described below in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Termination Fees and Expenses

(Page 67)

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience, generally, will bear their
own expenses related to the merger. However, under specified
circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, PerkinElmer or
Packard BioScience may be required to reimburse the other up to
a maximum of $1,500,000 for expenses related to the merger.

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience are each obligated to pay the
other a termination fee of $23,500,000 if the merger agreement
is terminated under specified circumstances set forth in the
merger agreement and described below in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Opinion of PerkinElmers Financial Advisor

(Page 38)

In connection with the merger, Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
PerkinElmers financial advisor, rendered a written
opinion, dated July 13, 2001, to the PerkinElmer board of
directors that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to
the matters described in its opinion and such other matters it
considered relevant, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
PerkinElmer. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex B. 
PerkinElmer urges its stockholders to read the
opinion in its entirety.
 The opinion of Goldman Sachs is
directed to the PerkinElmer board of directors and relates only
to the fairness of the exchange ratio from a financial point of
view. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder with respect to any other matter relating to the
proposed merger.

Opinion of Packard BioSciences Financial Advisor

(Page 42)

In connection with the merger, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Packard BioSciences financial advisor, rendered a written
opinion, dated July 13, 2001, to the Packard BioScience
board of directors that, as of the date of its opinion and based
upon and subject to the matters stated therein, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the stockholders of Packard BioScience. The full text of the
written opinion of JPMorgan is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex C. 
Packard BioScience
encourages its stockholders to read the opinion carefully in its
entirety to understand the procedures followed, the assumptions
made, the matters considered and the limitations on the review
undertaken by JPMorgan in providing its opinion.

JPMorgans opinion is addressed to the Packard
BioScience board of directors and relates only to the fairness
of the exchange ratio from a financial point



of view to the stockholders of Packard BioScience. The opinion
does not address any other aspect of the proposed merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
how to vote on the proposed merger or any other matters relating
to the proposed merger.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

(Page 49)

In considering the recommendation of the Packard BioScience
board of directors, Packard BioScience stockholders should be
aware of the interests that Packard BioScience executive
officers and directors have in the merger. These include:

 

	severance benefits to certain executive officers of Packard
	BioScience that may be paid under pre-existing employment
	agreements;

 

	an employment agreement between PerkinElmer and Franklin R.
	Witney, Packard BioSciences President, that will become
	effective upon consummation of the merger;

 

	accelerated vesting upon consummation of the merger of all
	options and certain shares of restricted stock held by Packard
	BioScience employees, executive officers and directors;

 

	the fact that, as of
	            ,
	 2001, the executive officers and directors of Packard
	BioScience held
	          shares
	 of Packard BioScience common stock;

 

	Packard BioSciences implementation of a retention bonus
	program in connection with the merger; and

 

	customary rights to indemnification of directors and executive
	officers of Packard BioScience against specified liabilities.

In addition, Packard BioScience stockholders should be aware
that Packard BioSciences largest stockholder, Stonington
Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., which, as of July 13,
2001 holds 30,898,890 shares, or approximately 45% of Packard
BioSciences outstanding shares, entered into a
stockholders agreement with PerkinElmer in connection with
the merger. Four members of the Packard BioScience board of
directors are designees of Stonington. Under the
stockholders agreement, Stonington is entitled to
registration rights with respect to the PerkinElmer shares it
receives in the merger and to nominate one director to the
PerkinElmer board of directors.

In considering the fairness of the merger to Packard BioScience
stockholders, the Packard BioScience board of directors took
into account these interests. Some of these interests are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Packard
BioScience stockholders generally in the merger.

Accounting Treatment

(Page 53)

In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger, as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmers financial statements prospectively as of the
completion of the merger.



Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

(Page 53)

We have structured the merger in order to qualify as a
reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. It is our
intention that no gain or loss will generally be recognized by
Packard BioScience stockholders for federal income tax purposes
on the exchange of shares of Packard BioScience common stock
solely for shares of PerkinElmer common stock. Packard
BioScience stockholders, however, will recognize gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes to the extent any cash received
in lieu of fractional shares is greater than or less than,
respectively, the tax basis allocable to the fractional shares.

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of
the merger to the Packard BioScience stockholders will depend on
the facts of each Packard BioScience stockholders own
situation. Each Packard BioScience stockholder should consult
his, her or its tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax
consequences of the merger.

PerkinElmer stockholders will have no tax consequences as a
result of the merger.

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience Stockholders Have No
Appraisal Rights

(Page 55)

Under applicable law, neither PerkinElmer stockholders nor
Packard BioScience stockholders have appraisal rights with
respect to the merger.

How the Rights of Packard BioScience Stockholders Will Differ
as PerkinElmer Stockholders

(Page 81)

The rights of Packard BioScience stockholders as stockholders of
PerkinElmer, a Massachusetts corporation, after the merger will
be governed by Massachusetts law and PerkinElmers
corporate charter and by-laws. Those rights differ from the
rights of Packard BioScience stockholders under Delaware law and
Packard BioSciences corporate charter and by-laws.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors before
you decide whether to vote to approve the proposals submitted to
you. You should also consider the other information in this
document.

Risks Relating to the Merger

PerkinElmers stock price is volatile and the value
of the PerkinElmer common stock issued in the merger will depend
on its market price at the time of the merger. No adjustment to
the exchange ratio will be made as a result of changes in the
market price of PerkinElmers common stock.

The market price of PerkinElmer common stock, like that of the
shares of Packard BioScience and many other high technology
companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. For
example, from July 3, 2000 to July 13, 2001,
PerkinElmer common stock traded as high as $60.50 per share and
as low as $21.50 per share.

At the closing of the merger, each share of Packard BioScience
common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.311
of a share of PerkinElmer common stock. This exchange ratio will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of PerkinElmer
common stock or of Packard BioScience common stock. In addition,
neither PerkinElmer nor Packard BioScience may unilaterally
terminate or renegotiate the merger agreement, and Packard
BioScience may not resolicit the vote of its stockholders,
solely because of changes in the market price of PerkinElmer
common stock or of Packard BioScience common stock. Any
reduction in PerkinElmers common stock price will result
in Packard BioScience stockholders receiving less value in the
merger at closing. Packard BioScience stockholders will not know
the exact value of PerkinElmer common stock to be issued to them
in the merger at the time of the special meeting of Packard
BioScience stockholders.

PerkinElmer may face challenges in integrating PerkinElmer
and Packard BioScience and, as a result, may not realize the
expected benefits of the proposed merger.

Integrating the operations and personnel of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience will be a complex process. PerkinElmer cannot
be certain that the integration will be completed rapidly or
will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The
successful integration of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience
will require, among other things, integration of sales and
marketing groups and coordination of development efforts. The
diversion of the attention of PerkinElmers management and
any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the
companies could cause the disruption of, or a loss of momentum
in, the activities of the combined companys business.
Further, the process of combining PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience could negatively affect employee morale and the
ability of the combined company to retain some of its key
employees after the merger. In addition, the announcement and
completion of the merger could cause customers to delay or
change orders for products as a result of uncertainty over the
integration of products. The inability to successfully integrate
the operations and personnel of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience, or any significant delay in achieving integration,
could have a material adverse effect on the combined company
after the merger.

If PerkinElmer does not successfully integrate Packard
BioScience or the mergers benefits do not meet the
expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market price
of PerkinElmer common stock may decline.

The market price of PerkinElmer common stock may decline as a
result of the merger if:

 

	the integration of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience is
	unsuccessful;

 

	PerkinElmer does not achieve the perceived financial and other
	benefits of the merger as rapidly as, or to the extent,
	anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or

 

	the effect of the merger on PerkinElmers financial results
	is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry
	analysts.



Failure to complete the merger may result in PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience paying a termination fee to the other.
Such a failure could also result in a decrease in the market
price of PerkinElmer common stock or Packard BioScience common
stock and cause each company to nevertheless incur legal and
accounting fees.

If the merger is not completed for any reason, PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience may be subject to a number of material risks,
including:

 

	PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience may require the other to pay a
	termination fee of $23,500,000 or up to $1,500,000 as
	reimbursement for expenses under the circumstances described in
	the merger agreement;

 

	the market price of PerkinElmer common stock or Packard
	BioScience common stock may decline to the extent that the
	current market price reflects a market assumption that the
	merger will be completed; and

 

	PerkinElmers and Packard BioSciences costs incurred
	related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must
	be paid even if the merger is not completed.

If the merger agreement is terminated and the Packard BioScience
board of directors seeks another merger or business combination,
Packard BioScience stockholders cannot be certain that Packard
BioScience will be able to find a partner willing to pay an
equivalent or more attractive price than the price PerkinElmer
has agreed to pay in the merger.

Some of the officers and directors of Packard BioScience
have conflicts of interest that may have influenced them to
support or approve the merger.

Packard BioSciences officers and directors may have been
influenced to approve the merger because of arrangements that
provide them with interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of Packard BioScience
stockholders in the merger, which are described under the
section entitled The Merger  Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger.

The Packard BioScience board of directors was aware of and took
into account these arrangements when it approved the merger. It
is possible that these arrangements may have influenced these
directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

The merger may cause Packard BioScience to lose key
personnel which could materially affect Packard
BioSciences business and require Packard BioScience to
incur substantial costs to recruit replacements for lost
personnel.

As a result of Packard BioSciences change in ownership,
current and prospective Packard BioScience employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles within
PerkinElmer. This uncertainty may adversely affect Packard
BioSciences ability to attract and retain key management,
sales, marketing and technical personnel. Any failure to attract
and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on
the combined business of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer.

Customers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience may
terminate their relationship with PerkinElmer or Packard
BioScience as a result of concerns over products and services to
be provided following the merger.

The announcement and closing of the merger could cause customers
and potential customers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience to
cancel orders or to fail to place new orders. In particular,
customers could be concerned about future products and services
or customer service during the period of integration of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer. The loss of customers or the failure
to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on
the future revenues and competitive position of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience.



Risks Relating to PerkinElmers Business

PerkinElmers operating results could be harmed if
the industries into which it sells its products are in downward
cycles.

Some of the industries and markets into which PerkinElmer sells
its products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are
characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing
capacity and erosion of average selling prices. Any significant
downturn in PerkinElmers customers markets or in
general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction
in demand for PerkinElmers products and could harm its
business. For example, in the fiscal quarter ended July 1,
2001, the operating results of PerkinElmers
Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments were adversely
affected by the downturn in the photography and semiconductor
markets.

If PerkinElmer does not introduce new products in a timely
manner, its products could become obsolete, and its operating
results would suffer.

PerkinElmer sells many of its products in industries
characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, PerkinElmers products could become
technologically obsolete over time, in which case
PerkinElmers revenue and operating results would suffer.
The success of PerkinElmers new product offerings will
depend upon several factors, including its ability to:

 

	accurately anticipate customer needs;

 

	innovate and develop new technologies and applications;

 

	successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;

 

	price its products competitively and manufacture and deliver its
	products in sufficient volumes and on time; and

 

	differentiate its offerings from its competitors offerings.

Many of PerkinElmers products are used by its customers to
develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore,
PerkinElmer must anticipate industry trends and develop products
in advance of the commercialization of its customers
products. In developing any new product, PerkinElmer may be
required to make a substantial investment before it can
determine the commercial viability of the new product. If
PerkinElmer fails to accurately foresee its customers
needs and future activities, PerkinElmer may invest heavily in
research and development of products that do not lead to
significant revenue.

Economic, political and other risks associated with
international sales and operations could adversely affect
PerkinElmers sales.

Since PerkinElmer sells its products worldwide, its businesses
are subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. PerkinElmers revenue originating outside
the United States represented 53% of its total revenues from
continuing operations in the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000. PerkinElmer anticipates that revenue from international
operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of
its total revenue. In addition, many of PerkinElmers
manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located
outside the United States. Accordingly, PerkinElmers
future results could be harmed by a variety of factors,
including:

 

	changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

 

	changes in a countrys or regions political or
	economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging
	markets;

 

	longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of
	collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

 

	trade protection measures and import or export licensing
	requirements;



 

	differing tax laws and changes in those laws;

 

	difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

 

	differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

 

	differing protection of intellectual property and changes in
	that protection; and

 

	differing regulatory requirements and changes in those
	requirements.

Fluctuations in PerkinElmers quarterly operating
results may cause its stock price to decline.

Given the nature of the markets in which PerkinElmer
participates, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and
profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic
conditions may cause PerkinElmer to adjust its operations. A
high proportion of PerkinElmers costs are fixed, due in
part to its significant sales, research and development and
manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could
disproportionately affect PerkinElmers operating results
in a quarter. Factors that may affect PerkinElmers
quarterly operating results and the market price of
PerkinElmers common stock include:

 

	demand for and market acceptance of PerkinElmers products;

 

	competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;

 

	adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in
	which PerkinElmer does business;

 

	adverse changes in industries, such as drug discovery,
	pharmaceutical research, telecommunications, semiconductors and
	electronics, on which PerkinElmer is particularly dependent;

 

	changes in the portions of PerkinElmers revenue
	represented by its various products and customers;

 

	delays or problems in the introduction of new products;

 

	PerkinElmers competitors announcement or
	introduction of new products, services or technological
	innovations;

 

	increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and

 

	changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. This volatility has significantly affected
the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated
to or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
the market price of PerkinElmers common stock.

PerkinElmer may not be able to successfully implement its
acquisition strategy and integrate acquired businesses,
including Packard BioScience, into its existing business or make
acquired businesses profitable.

One of PerkinElmers strategies is to supplement its
internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that
complement or augment its existing product lines. PerkinElmer
may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for
many reasons, including:

 

	competition among buyers;

 

	the need for regulatory and other approvals; and

 

	the high valuations of businesses.

Some of the businesses PerkinElmer may seek to acquire may be
marginally profitable or unprofitable. In addition, the earnings
or losses of acquired businesses may dilute PerkinElmers
earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable
levels of profitability, PerkinElmer must improve their
management, operations, products and market penetration.
PerkinElmer may not be successful in this regard and may
encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses
into its existing operations.



To finance PerkinElmers acquisitions, PerkinElmer may have
to raise additional funds, either through public or private
financings. PerkinElmer may be unable to obtain such funds or
may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.

PerkinElmer faces aggressive competition in many areas of
its business; if PerkinElmer does not compete effectively, its
business will be harmed.

PerkinElmer encounters aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of its business. PerkinElmer may not
be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To
remain competitive, PerkinElmer must develop new products and
periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner.
PerkinElmer anticipates that it may have to adjust prices of
many of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new
competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be
threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the
value of these product lines.

If PerkinElmer fails to maintain satisfactory compliance
with the Food and Drug Administrations regulations and
those of other governmental agencies, PerkinElmer may be forced
to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution,
and it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by PerkinElmers Life
Sciences segment are subject to regulation by the United States
Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities,
from design and development to labeling, manufacturing,
promotion, sales and distribution. If PerkinElmer fails to
comply with the FDAs regulations or those of similar
international agencies, PerkinElmer may have to recall products
and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition,
PerkinElmer could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for
PerkinElmers products or increase PerkinElmers
expenses.

PerkinElmer competes in markets in which it or its customers
must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations,
such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug
regulations. PerkinElmer develops, configures and markets its
products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.
Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand
for PerkinElmers products or the cost of producing these
products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for
PerkinElmers proprietary products, processes and
technologies may be difficult and expensive; PerkinElmer may
infringe intellectual property rights of third parties.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to PerkinElmer
because developing and marketing new technologies and products
is time-consuming and expensive. PerkinElmer owns many U.S. and
foreign patents and intends to apply for additional patents to
cover its products. PerkinElmer may not obtain issued patents
from any pending or future patent applications owned by or
licensed to PerkinElmer. The claims allowed under any issued
patents may not be broad enough to protect PerkinElmers
technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent
issued patents owned by or licensed to PerkinElmer or claim that
PerkinElmers products and operations infringe their patent
or other intellectual property rights. PerkinElmer may incur
significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect its
proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third
parties. In addition, claims of third parties against
PerkinElmer could result in awards of substantial damages or
court orders that could effectively prevent PerkinElmer from
making, using or selling its products in the U.S. or abroad.

PerkinElmer has substantial existing debt and may incur
additional debt in the future.

As of April 1, 2001, PerkinElmer had $585.7 million in
outstanding long-term debt. In addition, upon completion of the
merger, PerkinElmers consolidated debt will include
Packard BioSciences indebtedness, including Packard
BioSciences obligations under its senior subordinated
notes. As of March 31, 2001, the



amount outstanding under Packard BioSciences senior
subordinated notes was $118.1 million. PerkinElmers
substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that
PerkinElmer may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the
principal of, interest on and other amounts due in respect of
PerkinElmers indebtedness when due. PerkinElmer may also
obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of
credit and issue additional commercial paper to meet future
financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing
PerkinElmers total leverage.

PerkinElmers substantial leverage could have significant
negative consequences, including:

 

	increasing PerkinElmers vulnerability to general adverse
	economic and industry conditions;

 

	limiting PerkinElmers ability to obtain additional
	financing;

 

	requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of
	PerkinElmers cash flow from operations to service its
	indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of its cash flow
	available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;

 

	limiting PerkinElmers flexibility in planning for, or
	reacting to, changes in its business and the industries in which
	PerkinElmer competes; and

 

	placing PerkinElmer at a possible competitive disadvantage with
	less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better
	access to capital resources.

A significant portion of PerkinElmers outstanding
indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result,
PerkinElmers interest payment obligations on such
indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase.

Risks Relating to Packard BioSciences Business

As competition in the markets Packard BioScience targets
intensifies, Packard BioScience may not be able to compete
effectively in these markets.

The life sciences research tools industry is highly competitive,
and Packard BioScience encounters competition from a large
number of manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets.
Some of Packard BioSciences competitors compete with
Packard BioScience in only one of its product lines. Others
compete with Packard BioScience in a number of its product
lines. In addition, Packard BioScience has various competitors
that are focusing on the areas that are being addressed by
Packard BioSciences integrated platforms.

Some of Packard BioSciences competitors, such as Applera
Corp. (formerly PE Biosystems), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and
Beckman Coulter, Inc., are significantly larger and have greater
resources than Packard BioScience does. These competitors could
at any time decide to use a more substantial amount of their
resources in the markets in which Packard BioScience competes
and, as a result, compete more broadly and more directly with
Packard BioScience.

Companies that, like Packard BioScience, design, manufacture and
market analytical instruments for use in the life sciences
research industry, face competition in these areas from genomic,
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics companies, and
also from academic and research institutions and government or
other publicly-funded agencies, both in the United States and
abroad. Packard BioScience may not be able to compete
effectively with all of these competitors.

Packard BioSciences success will depend partly on
its ability to successfully introduce new products and platforms
and expand the range of applications for its current
products.

In a market primarily driven by the need for innovative
products, Packard BioSciences revenues growth will depend
on overcoming various technological challenges to successfully
introduce new products and platforms into the marketplace in a
timely manner. Packard BioSciences new technology
platforms require state-of-the-art or even pioneering know-how
in the areas of biochemistry, fluidics and physics. In addition,
Packard BioScience must continue to develop new applications for
its existing products, such as



integrated platforms. Market acceptance of these new products
and platforms will depend on many factors, including
demonstrating to existing and potential customers that Packard
BioSciences technologies are superior to other
technologies and products that are available now or may become
available in the future.

If Packard BioScience is not able to overcome these
technological challenges, or even if it experiences difficulties
or delays, Packard BioScience may lose its current customers and
may not be able to attract new customers, which could seriously
harm its business and future growth prospects. In addition, some
of Packard BioSciences licensed technology is subject to
contractual restrictions, which may limit its ability to develop
or commercialize products for some applications. For example,
many of Packard BioSciences license agreements are limited
to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical
diagnostics applications. Packard BioScience also may be unable
to obtain licenses to new or existing technologies needed to
introduce new products.

If Packard BioScience is unable to protect its
intellectual property effectively, it may be unable to prevent
third parties from using its technology, which could impair its
ability to compete effectively in the market.

Packard BioSciences success will depend in part on its
ability, and the ability of its business partners and licensors,
to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for the
technology underlying its products, both in the United States
and in other countries. There can be no assurance that any of
the presently pending or future patent applications will result
in issued patents, or that any patents issued to Packard
BioScience or licensed by Packard BioScience will not be
challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable. Further, Packard
BioScience cannot guarantee that any patents issued to it will
provide a basis for commercially viable products or provide it
with a significant competitive advantage.

In addition to its patents, Packard BioScience possesses a wide
array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and
licenses intellectual property rights to and from third parties.
Such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology
underlying Packard BioSciences products. Moreover, some of
Packard BioSciences licenses can be terminated or
converted to non-exclusive by the licensor if Packard BioScience
fails to meet specified performance targets.

If Packard BioScience fails to successfully enforce its
proprietary technology or otherwise maintain the proprietary
nature of its intellectual property with respect to its
significant current or proposed products, Packard
BioSciences competitive position and, as a result, its
sales could suffer.

Notwithstanding Packard BioSciences efforts to protect its
intellectual property, its competitors may independently develop
similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal
or superior to Packard BioSciences technology and products
without infringing on any of Packard BioSciences
intellectual property rights or design around its proprietary
technologies. If customers prefer these alternative
technologies, Packard BioSciences sales could be adversely
affected.

Packard BioSciences products could infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others, causing costly
litigation and seriously harming Packard BioSciences
business.

Due to the very significant number of U.S. and foreign patents
issued to, and other intellectual property rights owned by,
entities operating in the industry in which Packard BioScience
operates, Packard BioScience believes that there is a
significant risk of litigation arising from infringement of
these patents and other rights. Third parties may assert
infringement or other intellectual property claims against
Packard BioScience or its business partners or licensors.
Packard BioScience may have to pay substantial damages,
including treble damages, for past infringement if it is
ultimately determined that its products infringe a third
partys proprietary rights. In addition, even if such
claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in
substantial expense and divert the efforts of technical and
management personnel.

Packard BioScience also may be subject to significant damages or
injunctions against development and sale of some of its
products, which could have a material adverse effect on its
future revenues. Furthermore, claims of intellectual property
infringement may require Packard BioScience to enter into



royalty or license agreements with third parties, and Packard
BioScience may not be able to obtain royalty or license
agreements on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.

A decline in the use of radioisotopic processes and
instruments could have a material adverse effect on its
revenues.

Packard BioSciences traditional or legacy
product lines, which are used in connection with radioisotopic
methods, have historically been a significant portion of Packard
BioSciences total revenues, and in the year ended December
31, 2000, they continued to account for approximately 28% of
Packard BioSciences total instrument and related
consumables revenues. Because of their radioactivity, isotopic
labels are environmentally unfriendly and difficult and
potentially harmful to handle. Their by-products create waste
disposal problems for Packard BioSciences customers that
are becoming increasingly more expensive. Packard BioScience
believes that the trend in the life sciences research industry
is toward the use of competing nonisotopic instrumentation.
Accordingly, Packard BioScience has shifted its focus to
nonisotopic methodologies, including fluorescent and
chemiluminescent instruments. However, you should be aware that
a decline in traditional radioisotopic methods may have a
material adverse impact on Packard BioSciences revenues
and operating profit.

Because a substantial portion of Packard BioSciences
assets is represented by intangibles, such as goodwill
associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing
patent rights and technology licenses, the failure to realize
the full value of those assets could adversely affect Packard
BioSciences results of operations.

As of December 31, 2000, Packard BioSciences total
assets included $119.7 million of net intangible assets,
representing approximately 39% of its total assets and
approximately 144% of its total stockholders equity. Net
intangible assets consist of goodwill associated with
acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights
and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These
assets have historically been amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. In connection with recently
issued SFAS No. 142, Packard BioScience will cease to
amortize its goodwill and other intangibles assets as of
January 1, 2002. Packard BioScience periodically evaluates
whether events or circumstances have occurred that would
indicate that the carrying values of those assets may no longer
be recoverable and any resulting write-down is recognized as a
charge to its earnings. There can be no assurance that Packard
BioScience will ultimately be able to realize the full value
assigned to those assets. Any realization assessment that
results in the write-off of a significant portion of Packard
BioSciences net intangible assets could adversely affect
its results of operations.

Because purchases of Packard BioSciences products
are significantly affected by capital spending policies of its
customers and government funding, any decrease in customer
capital spending or government funding could adversely affect
Packard BioSciences sales and growth prospects.

The capital spending policies of Packard BioSciences
primary customers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
agrochemical companies and clinical diagnostics laboratories,
have a significant effect on the demand for its products and
platforms. Those policies are based on a wide variety of
factors, including resources available to make these purchases,
spending priorities among various types of equipment and
policies regarding capital expenditures during industry
downturns or recessionary periods. These companies represented
in total approximately 45% of Packard BioSciences revenues
in the year ended December 31, 2000. Any decrease in
capital spending by customers resulting from any of these
factors could adversely affect Packard BioSciences sales
and growth prospects.

Similarly, many of Packard BioSciences customers,
including universities, government research laboratories,
private foundations and other institutions, obtain funding for
the purchase of Packard BioSciences products from grants
by governments or government agencies. If government funding
necessary to purchase Packard BioSciences products were to
decrease, sales could be adversely affected.



Packard BioSciences revenues and operating results
could be adversely impacted if risks associated with
international sales and operations materialize.

Since Packard BioScience sells its products worldwide, its
business is subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. Packard BioSciences revenues originating
outside the United States represented 45% of its total revenues
in the year ended December 31, 2000. Packard BioScience
anticipates that revenues from international operations will
continue to represent a substantial portion of its total
revenues. In addition, a number of Packard BioSciences
manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the
United States. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar
increases relative to the value of currencies Packard BioScience
uses to do business in foreign countries, its revenues and
operating results, which are stated in U.S. dollars, could be
adversely affected. In addition, because most of Packard
BioSciences products are manufactured in the United States
for export to foreign countries, trade protection measures and
import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive
actions by foreign governments could have an adverse effect on
its revenues and operating results.

The current technology labor market is very competitive,
and Packard BioSciences business may suffer if it is not
able to hire and retain sufficient personnel.

Packard BioSciences future success depends on the
continued service of its key technical, sales, marketing,
manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. The loss
of the services of any of these individuals could have a
material adverse effect on Packard BioSciences product
development and commercialization efforts. In addition,
research, product development and commercialization will require
additional skilled personnel. Competition for qualified
personnel in the technology area is intense, and Packard
BioScience operates in several geographic locations where labor
markets are particularly competitive, including New Haven,
Connecticut, Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts and Los
Angeles, California, where key product development laboratories
are located. If Packard BioScience is unable to attract and
retain a sufficient number of qualified employees on acceptable
terms, its business, financial condition and results of
operations could be seriously harmed. The inability to retain
and hire qualified personnel could also hinder the future
expansion of Packard BioSciences business.

SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following selected historical consolidated financial
information of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience has been
derived from their respective historical consolidated financial
statements including their notes, and should be read in
conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and
notes. The historical consolidated financial statements of
PerkinElmer as of January 2, 2000 and December 31, 2000 and
for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000
as reclassified for the planned sale of its Security and
Detection Systems business in its Current Report on
Form 8-K filed on August 3, 2001 and the historical
consolidated financial statements of Packard BioScience as of
December 31, 1999 and 2000 and for the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000 were audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, and are
incorporated in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by
reference. See Where You Can Find More Information.

The PerkinElmer historical financial information as of and for
the interim periods presented below has been prepared on the
same basis as the information derived from historical
consolidated financial statements prepared on an annual basis.
In the opinion of management of PerkinElmer, this historical
information includes all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations of PerkinElmer as
of these dates and for these periods. The results of the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for future periods.

The Packard BioScience historical financial information as of
and for the interim periods presented below has been prepared on
the same basis as the information derived from historical
financial statements prepared on an annual basis. In the opinion
of management of Packard BioScience, this historical information
includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and results of operations of Packard BioScience as of
these dates and for these periods. The results of the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for future periods.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of NEN and GSLI as purchases and
properly reflects the appropriate accounting methods for all
intangible assets under the accounting rules that were in
existence prior to June 30, 2001.

Effective June 30, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,
Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Those statements require the use of the
purchase method of accounting and the allocation of the purchase
price to assets and liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values. They define the criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and
eliminate the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 are
effective for any business combination that is initiated after
June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro
forma combined statements of operations do not reflect any
amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite
lives that will result from PerkinElmers proposed
acquisition of Packard BioScience.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of Packard BioScience and NEN as of
the beginning of the periods presented and should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and related
notes thereto for PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and NEN. The
financial statements required to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the NEN acquisition were included as
exhibits in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by
PerkinElmer on August 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
financial information for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 and the three-month period ended April 1, 2001 give
effect to the acquisitions as if they were completed as of
January 3, 2000, and combine PerkinElmer, Packard
BioScience and NENs historical statements of operations
for each respective period as necessary. The unaudited pro forma
combined results for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 exclude, due to its non-recurring nature, an
acquisition-related charge of $24.3 million for acquired
in-process research and development related to



NEN. Additionally, the pro forma financial information exclude,
due to their non-recurring nature, an estimated
acquisition-related charge of $66.8 million for acquired
in-process research and development related to the proposed
acquisition of Packard BioScience. PerkinElmer has not yet
finalized its appraisal of this in-process research and
development and accordingly, the final amount of the excluded
charge may differ from this estimate. The unaudited pro forma
combined balance sheet as of April 1, 2001 includes the
historical balance sheet of PerkinElmer as of April 1, 2001
and Packard BioScience as of March 31, 2001 and gives
effect to the proposed acquisition of Packard BioScience as if
it occurred on April 1, 2001.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is
provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of PerkinElmers operating results that would
have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on the
dates, or at the beginning of the periods, for which the
consummation of the acquisitions is being given effect, nor is
it necessarily indicative of PerkinElmers future operating
results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments do not reflect any
operating efficiencies and cost savings that PerkinElmer
believes are achievable.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been
prepared using the purchase method of accounting, whereby the
total cost of the acquisitions has been allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values at the effective date of
each acquisition. For the Packard BioScience acquisition, such
allocations will be based on studies and independent valuations,
which are currently being conducted. Accordingly, the
allocations reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information are preliminary and subject to revision.

You should review the detailed unaudited pro forma combined
financial information under the section entitled Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Financial Information for further
discussion of these matters, including footnotes.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

The following table summarizes certain per share information for
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience on a historical, pro forma
combined and equivalent pro forma combined basis. You should
read the information below along with the selected historical
consolidated financial data and the unaudited pro forma combined
financial data included in the section of this proxy

Dividends

During fiscal 2000, PerkinElmers board of directors
declared four regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per
share, resulting in an annual rate of $0.28 per share, after
giving retroactive effect to the two-for-one stock split of
PerkinElmer common stock effected on June 4, 2001. During
the first and second quarters of fiscal 2001, PerkinElmers
board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07
per share.

Since Packard BioScience became a public company on
April 19, 2000, it has not declared or paid cash dividends
and does not intend to pay any cash dividends on its capital
stock in the foreseeable future. If the merger does not occur,
Packard BioScience currently intends to retain earnings. Packard
BioSciences future dividend policy will depend on its
earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and the
requirements of the financing agreements to which it may be a
party, and on other factors considered relevant by its board of
directors. In addition, covenants in Packard BioSciences
senior credit facility and the indenture governing its senior
subordinated notes limit its ability to declare and pay cash
dividends on its common stock.

Packard BioScience is furnishing this document to holders of
Packard BioScience common stock in connection with the
solicitation by the Packard BioScience board of directors of
proxies to be voted at the special meeting to be held on

Date, Time and Place of Meeting

The special meeting will be held on
[                         ],

 2001 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Ramada Plaza Hotel,
275 Research Parkway, Meriden, Connecticut.

What Will Be Voted Upon

At the special meeting, stockholders of Packard BioScience will
be asked to adopt and approve the merger agreement and merger
with PerkinElmer, under which a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PerkinElmer will be merged with and into Packard BioScience and
each outstanding share of Packard BioScience will be converted
into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of common stock of
PerkinElmer, and to transact any other business that may be
properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournments,
postponements or continuations of that meeting.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

Only stockholders of record of Packard BioScience at the close
of business on the
[                         ],
 2001 record date for the special meeting are entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each Packard BioScience
stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share held as of
the close of business on the record date. At the close of
business on the record date, there were
[               ]
 shares of Packard BioScience common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, held by
[               ]
 holders of record.

Vote Required to Adopt the Merger Agreement

Under Delaware law, holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Packard BioScience common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting must vote in favor of adopting the merger
agreement. Stonington Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P.,
Packard BioSciences largest stockholder, has agreed to
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and to
direct other shares over which it asserts voting control to vote
to adopt the merger agreement, as long as the Packard BioScience
board of directors does not withdraw or knowingly modify in a
material adverse manner its recommendation of the merger in
response to a superior proposal in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations of, the merger agreement. Emery G. Olcott,
Packard BioSciences chairman and chief executive officer,
Franklin R. Witney, Packard BioSciences president and
chief operating officer, Timothy O. White, Jr., Packard
BioSciences vice president, general counsel and secretary,
and Richard T. McKernan, a former senior vice president and
director of Packard BioScience, together with certain members of
their families, have also agreed to vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, as long as the Packard
BioScience board of directors does not withdraw or knowingly
modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation of the
merger in response to a superior proposal in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations of, the merger agreement.
Collectively, these stockholders have agreed, with respect to a
total of 34,397,355 shares of Packard BioScience common stock or
     % of the outstanding shares of
Packard BioScience common stock on
            ,
 2001, the record date for the special meeting of Packard
BioScience stockholders, to vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement, subject to the above conditions. Packard
BioSciences directors, executive officers and their
affiliates are entitled to vote      %
of the outstanding shares of Packard BioScience common stock as
of the record date.



Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. Abstentions are counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists.

If you hold your shares of Packard BioScience common stock
through a broker, bank or other nominee, generally the nominee
may only vote your Packard BioScience common stock in accordance
with your instructions. However, if your broker, bank or other
nominee has not timely received your instructions, it may vote
on matters for which it has discretionary voting authority.
Brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to vote on
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If a nominee cannot
vote on a matter because it does not have discretionary voting
authority, this is a broker non-vote on that matter.
Broker non-votes are counted as shares present or represented at
the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists.

For purposes of the vote with respect to the merger agreement
required under Delaware law, a failure to vote, a vote to
abstain and a broker non-vote will each have the same legal
effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

The Packard BioScience proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is solicited on behalf of the Packard
BioScience board of directors. Packard BioScience stockholders
are requested to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy
and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise
mail it to Packard BioScience. If your shares of Packard
BioScience common stock are registered in street name, your
broker may offer telephone and Internet voting options. You

other nominee to see which options are available. Please see the
accompanying proxy for more information.

All properly executed proxies received by Packard BioScience
prior to the special meeting that are not revoked will be voted
at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxies, or, if no direction is indicated, will
be voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Packard
BioSciences board of directors does not presently intend
to bring any other business before the special meeting. As of
the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the board
knows of no other matters to be brought before the special
meeting. As to any other business that may properly come before
the special meeting, the persons named as proxies in the
accompanying Packard BioScience proxy will vote those proxies in
accordance with their judgment. A Packard BioScience stockholder
who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is
exercised at the special meeting by:

 

	delivering to the secretary of Packard BioScience a written
	notice, bearing a date later than the date of proxy, stating
	that the proxy is revoked;

 

	signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
	bearing a later date than the date of the previous proxy prior
	to the vote at the special meeting; or

 

	attending the special meeting and voting in person.

However, if you as a Packard BioScience stockholder elect to
vote in person at the special meeting and your shares are held
by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring to the
special meeting a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee authorizing you to vote the shares.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer will share the costs, other
than fees of accountants and attorneys, of preparing and mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and Packard BioScience
will bear the other costs of the solicitation of proxies from
its stockholders. Following the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Packard BioScience and its agents may

will send beneficial



owners the proxy materials. Packard BioScience will, upon
request, reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for

stockholders to vote proxies without delay.

Board Recommendation

Packard BioSciences board of directors has voted
unanimously to adopt the merger agreement and believes that the
merger is fair and in the best interests of Packard BioScience
and its stockholders. Therefore, Packard BioSciences board
of directors recommends that Packard BioScience stockholders
vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the merger.

The proposed merger is of great importance to the stockholders
of Packard BioScience. Accordingly, Packard BioScience
stockholders are urged to read and carefully consider the
information presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
and to complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed

THE PERKINELMER SPECIAL MEETING

PerkinElmer is furnishing this document to holders of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the PerkinElmer board of directors for use at the
special meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders to be held on
[                         ],

[                         ],
 2001, and any adjournment, postponement or continuation of the
meeting.

This document is first being furnished to PerkinElmer
stockholders on or about
[                         ],
 2001.

Date, Time and Place of Meeting

The special meeting will be held on
[                         ],

[                         ],
 2001, at
[                         ],
 local time, at Sheraton Needham Hotel, 100 Cabot Street,
Needham, Massachusetts 02494-2802.

What Will Be Voted Upon

At the special meeting, stockholders of PerkinElmer will be
asked to approve the issuance of 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer
common stock for each outstanding share of Packard BioScience
common stock in connection with the merger and to transact any
other business that may be properly brought before the special
meeting or any adjournments, postponements or continuations of
that meeting.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

Only stockholders of record of PerkinElmer common stock at the
close of business on the
[                         ],
 2001 record date for the special meeting are entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each PerkinElmer
stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of
PerkinElmer common stock held as of the close of business on the
record date.

Vote Required to Approve the Issuance

PerkinElmer stockholder approval of the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger is required under the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, on which
PerkinElmers common stock is listed, because the number of
shares of PerkinElmer common stock issued in the merger will
exceed 20% of the number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the merger. The affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock present or represented by proxy and
voting on the proposal is required to approve the issuance of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger. As of
the close of business on the record date, there were
[          ]
shares of PerkinElmer common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote, held by
[          ]
holders of record. PerkinElmers directors, executive
officers and their affiliates are entitled to vote
     % of the outstanding shares of
PerkinElmer common stock as of
            ,
 2001, the record date of the special meeting of PerkinElmer
stockholders.

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

If you hold your shares of PerkinElmer common stock through a
broker, bank or other nominee, generally the nominee may only
vote your PerkinElmer common stock in accordance with your
instructions. However, if it has not timely received your
instructions, the nominee may vote on matters for which it has
discretionary voting authority. Brokers will not have
discretionary voting authority to vote on the proposal to issue
the PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger. As a
result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner
of shares held in street name, brokers are not empowered to vote
these shares to approve the proposed issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger.

Since the required vote to approve the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in connection with the merger is based on the
number of shares present or represented by proxy at the special
meeting, rather than outstanding shares, abstentions and broker
non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal
assuming a quorum is present.



Voting and Revocation of Proxies

The PerkinElmer proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is solicited on behalf of the PerkinElmer
board of directors. PerkinElmer stockholders are requested to
complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and promptly
return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise mail it to
PerkinElmer. If your shares of PerkinElmer common stock are
registered in street name, your broker may offer telephone and
Internet voting options. You should check the information
forwarded by your broker, bank or other nominee to see which
options are available. Please see the accompanying proxy for
more information.

All properly executed proxies received by PerkinElmer prior to
the special meeting that are not revoked will be voted at the
special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on
the proxies, or, if no direction is indicated, will be voted to
approve the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in connection
with the merger. PerkinElmers board of directors does not
presently intend to bring any other business before the special
meeting. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the board knows of no other matters to be
brought before the special meeting. As to any other business
that may properly come before the special meeting, the persons
named as proxies in the accompanying PerkinElmer proxy will vote
those proxies in accordance with their judgment. A PerkinElmer
stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time
before it is exercised at the special meeting by:

 

	delivering to the clerk of PerkinElmer a written notice, bearing
	a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy
	is revoked;

 

	signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
	bearing a later date than the date of the previous proxy prior
	to the vote at the special meeting; or

 

	attending the special meeting and voting in person.

However, if you as a PerkinElmer stockholder elect to vote in
person at the special meeting and your shares are held by a
broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring to the special
meeting a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee
authorizing you to vote the shares.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will share the costs, other
than fees of accountants and attorneys, of preparing and mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and PerkinElmer will bear
the other costs of the solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders. Following the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, PerkinElmer and its agents may solicit
proxies by mail, telephone or in person. PerkinElmer has
retained a proxy solicitation firm, Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Incorporated, to aid in the solicitation of
proxies. PerkinElmer will pay that firm an estimated fee of
$8,500, plus reimbursement of expenses. In addition, brokerage
houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries will send
beneficial owners the proxy materials. PerkinElmer will, upon
request, reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for
their reasonable expenses. PerkinElmer urges its stockholders to
vote proxies without delay.

Board Recommendation

PerkinElmers board of directors has voted to unanimously
approve the merger agreement and the issuance of PerkinElmer
common stock in the merger and believes that the merger is fair
and in the best interests of PerkinElmer and its stockholders.
Therefore, PerkinElmers board of directors unanimously
recommends that PerkinElmer stockholders vote FOR approval of
the issuance of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in the merger.

The proposed merger is of great importance to the stockholders
of PerkinElmer. Accordingly, PerkinElmers stockholders are
urged to read and carefully consider the information presented
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date,
sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope.



THE MERGER

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes
material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger
agreement. While PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience believe that
the description covers the material terms of the merger and the
related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this
entire document and the other documents referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully for a more complete
understanding of the merger.

Background of the Merger

During the past several years, the PerkinElmer board of
directors has regularly reviewed PerkinElmers long-term
objectives and strategic position, particularly in terms of
shifting PerkinElmers business strategy away from mature
markets and toward emerging and higher growth markets. As part
of this strategy, PerkinElmer management has considered various
strategic transactions, including acquisitions, alliances and
distribution agreements, with a number of life sciences
companies, including Packard BioScience.

The Packard BioScience board of directors regularly reviewed
Packard BioSciences long-term strategies and objectives,
and in that connection has considered various strategic
alternatives, including pursuing the companys business
plan as an independent entity, acquisitions and business
combinations.

On or about April 10, 2001, PerkinElmers senior
management decided to explore a possible business combination
with Packard BioScience. Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, initiated contact between the
two companies by telephoning Emery G. Olcott, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Packard BioScience, and Alexis P. Michas, a
member of Packard BioSciences board of directors and a
representative of Stonington Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund,
L.P., a significant stockholder of Packard BioScience.
Messrs. Olcott and Michas indicated a willingness to engage
in discussions relating to a possible business combination.

On April 26, 2001, Mr. Summe and Mr. Michas met
in person to discuss the strategic benefits of such business
combination and its possible terms. Mr. Summe and
Mr. Michas discussed a number of issues relating to the
proposed transaction, including valuation, expected operational
efficiencies and other cost savings, representation on the
PerkinElmer board, liquidity and due diligence.

From April 27, 2001 through May 23, 2001, Terrance L.
Carlson, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of
PerkinElmer, and PerkinElmers financial advisor, Goldman,
Sachs & Co., engaged in several discussions with Packard
BioSciences financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc., regarding potential valuations, financial models, business
due diligence and potential transaction structures.

On May 15, 2001, Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott met in
person to discuss the strategic benefits of a possible business
combination and various issues related to a possible transaction.

At a regular meeting of the board of directors of PerkinElmer on
May 17, 2001, management informed the board that
discussions were taking place with Packard BioScience regarding
a possible business combination. No formal vote was taken but
the directors supported the discussions.

After discussions among senior management of PerkinElmer, on
May 24, 2001, Mr. Summe sent a non-binding letter to
Mr. Olcott, outlining the terms and exchange ratios on
which PerkinElmer would entertain an acquisition of Packard
BioScience.

Following the May 24th letter, Messrs. Summe and
Olcott spoke by telephone and agreed that the management teams
of the two companies should meet on June 1, 2001 to continue
discussions.

On May 31, 2001, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience entered
into a mutual non-disclosure agreement that included each
partys agreement not to purchase shares of the other
except in a consensual transaction.



On June 1, 2001, senior management of PerkinElmer and
PerkinElmers financial advisors met with senior management
of Packard BioScience and Packard BioSciences financial
advisors. At this meeting, representatives from each company
presented financial and operational information to, and
participated in question and answer sessions with, the other.
The financial information presented included forecasts for the
periods 2001 to 2003. The forecasts for revenue, cash flow and
earnings were consistent with publicly available analysts
forecasts as reported by First Call. The parties also discussed
possible synergies resulting from a strategic combination and
various elements of valuation.

On June 5, 2001, after discussions with PerkinElmer senior
management, Mr. Summe sent Mr. Olcott a second non-binding
letter outlining revised terms of a possible transaction,
including valuation, and requesting items be made available to
PerkinElmer as part of its continuing business and financial due
diligence process.

On June 6, 2001, Mr. Olcott replied to Mr. Summe
by letter setting forth terms and exchange ratios that he would
be prepared to discuss with the Packard BioScience board of
directors in connection with a proposed transaction. After
reviewing this correspondence with Messrs. Friel and
Carlson, Mr. Summe called Mr. Olcott to continue
discussions. Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott discussed
possible cost savings and other operational efficiencies and
their impact on valuation. Mr. Summe and Mr. Olcott
agreed that PerkinElmer should commence its diligence regarding
possible cost savings and other operational efficiencies.

On June 8, 2001 the Packard BioScience board of directors
met by teleconference, together with its legal advisors and
JPMorgan, and reviewed the status of the discussions with
PerkinElmer. The Packard BioScience board also discussed
strategic alternatives available to the company and the
boards duties and goals with respect to a potential
transaction. The Packard BioScience board of directors
authorized management to continue the discussions with
PerkinElmer.

Commencing on June 12, 2001, representatives of
PerkinElmer, including its consultants, accountants and outside
counsel, conducted due diligence, including a review of
documents made available at the offices of Packard
BioSciences outside counsel and other documents made
available by Packard BioScience management.

On June 16, 2001, drafts of a merger agreement and related
documentation were distributed by counsel for PerkinElmer for
review by PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and its outside
counsel. From that date through July 12, 2001, PerkinElmer,
together with its counsel and other advisors, and Packard
BioScience, together with its counsel and other advisors,
negotiated the various terms of the merger agreement and related
documents.

On June 18, 2001, representatives of the parties, including
their senior management and financial advisors, met in person
for a presentation by Packard BioScience management relating to
its business. At this meeting, the parties further discussed
potential operational efficiencies and the results of diligence.

On June 19, 2001, representatives of the parties, including
their senior management, Stonington and the parties
respective financial advisors, met in person for a second day
for a presentation by PerkinElmer management relating to its
business.

On June 22, 2001, Packard BioSciences financial
advisors indicated that Packard BioScience had reservations
about the proposed valuation in light of recent trends in stock
prices. After further conversations, the parties agreed to
reassess the valuation and transaction structure, but that work
should continue on the agreements.

On July 3, 2001, Mr. Michas telephoned Mr. Summe
to propose a revised exchange ratio and consideration consisting
solely of PerkinElmer common stock, rather than common stock and
cash. Between July 3, 2001 and July 6, 2001,
Messrs. Summe, Michas, and Olcott engaged in several
telephone negotiations regarding the exchange ratio and form of
transaction consideration. On July 6, 2001, the parties
agreed on an exchange ratio and form of consideration, subject
to satisfactory completion of outstanding due diligence and
documentation.



From July 6, 2001 through July 12, 2001, the parties,
together with their respective outside counsel, engaged in
negotiations regarding the merger agreement and related
documentation, stockholders agreement and voting
agreements, including termination rights and fees,
non-solicitation provisions, representations and warranties and
covenants. During this period, final agreement on these and
other issues was reached over the course of several discussions
between management of and counsel to PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience. In addition, during this period, the parties
continued their diligence reviews with respect to each other and
prepared and discussed each partys disclosure schedules to
the merger agreement.

Between July 9, 2001 and July 11, 2001,
Mr. Olcott spoke with each of Packard BioSciences
outside directors individually to discuss the status of the
negotiations, and the terms of the proposed deal. During the
same period, representatives from JPMorgan spoke with each of
Packard BioSciences outside directors to discuss the
fairness of the merger consideration, and to answer the
directors questions with respect to the proposed merger.

On July 13, 2001, the parties completed their diligence
reviews and finalized the terms of the merger agreement and
related documentation.

On July 13, 2001, PerkinElmer held a special meeting of its
board of directors to review the terms of the merger agreement
and related documents and to consider approval of the merger
agreement and the merger. PerkinElmers management reviewed
with the board the strategic benefits of the transaction and
Goldman Sachs reviewed with the board financial analyses
prepared in connection with its fairness opinion.
PerkinElmers outside legal counsel described the
provisions of the merger agreement and reviewed the boards
responsibilities in connection with the proposed transaction.
Goldman Sachs presented its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, that, as of the date of its opinion and based on and
subject to the matters described in its opinion and such other
matters it considered relevant, the exchange ratio was fair from
a financial point of view to PerkinElmer. PerkinElmers
board of directors, after considering the terms of the merger
agreement and other related documents and the various
presentations, unanimously approved the merger and the merger
agreement and the related documentation. PerkinElmers
board of directors then authorized PerkinElmers management
to execute the merger agreement and related agreements.

On July 13, 2001, Packard BioScience held a special meeting
of its board of directors to review the terms of the merger
agreement and related documents and to consider the approval of
the merger agreement and the merger. Packard BioScience
management reviewed the strategic benefits of the transaction
and JPMorgan reviewed the financial analyses it performed in
connection with its opinion. JPMorgan presented its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date
of its opinion and based upon and subject to the matters stated
therein, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of the Packard BioScience common stock.
Packard BioScience outside legal counsel described the
provisions of the merger agreement and reviewed the boards
responsibilities in connection with the proposed transaction.
The Packard BioScience board, after considering the terms of the
merger agreement and the other related documents and the various
presentations, unanimously approved the merger and the merger
agreement and the related documentation, concluding that the
consideration to be paid to Packard BioSciences
stockholders in the merger was fair and in the best interests of
Packard BioScience and its stockholders. The Packard BioScience
board then authorized Packard BioSciences management to
execute the merger agreement and related agreements.

On the evening of July 13, 2001, PerkinElmer,
PerkinElmers subsidiary, Pablo Acquisition Corp., and
Packard BioScience executed the merger agreement and the related
agreements.

Packard BioSciences Reasons for the Merger

Packard BioSciences board of directors has voted
unanimously to adopt the merger agreement and determined that
the merger is fair and in the best interests of Packard
BioScience and its stockholders. Accordingly, Packard
BioSciences board recommends that Packard BioScience
stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. In reaching its decision, Packard



BioSciences board of directors consulted with Packard
BioSciences management and legal and financial advisors,
and considered the following material factors:

 

The strategic fit between the products offered by Packard
	BioScience and those offered by PerkinElmer
. Packard
	BioSciences management believes that adding the primary
	products offered by Packard BioScience, including liquid
	handling and automated sample preparation products, to
	PerkinElmers depth in instrumentation and reagent products
	will allow the combined company to offer a full spectrum of drug
	discovery tools to its customers and to be well-positioned to
	address emerging biochip, microarray and other life sciences
	opportunities with their combined technologies, including
	consumables, instrumentation and informatics software.

 

The ability of the combined entity to take advantage of a
	larger and more geographically diverse customer base.

PerkinElmer has greater penetration of its sales force,
	customers and installed systems in different areas of the world,
	especially Europe, than does Packard BioScience. Packard
	BioSciences management expects that Packard
	BioSciences and PerkinElmers differing global
	presences will enable the combined company to make additional
	international sales.

 

Ability of the combined entity to grow. 
Packard
	BioSciences management believes that the combined entity
	will have greater financial strength relative to Packard
	BioScience as an independent company. With this financial
	strength, the combined company may be able to invest the large
	amount of capital in research and development needed to compete
	successfully in high-growth areas, such as proteomics, biochips
	and microarrays, that Packard BioScience might not be able to
	invest on a stand-alone basis. Moreover, Packard
	BioSciences management believes that the combined company
	may have the ability to acquire companies that Packard
	BioScience would be less likely to acquire as an independent
	company.

 

Synergies. 
Packard BioSciences management believes
	that because of the complementary nature of various Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer businesses, there is an opportunity
	for significant cost savings. These cost savings are a potential
	benefit that Packard BioScience stockholders may realize as
	stockholders of PerkinElmer.

 

Premium. 
Although the exchange ratio provided for in the
	merger agreement represents a premium of less than 1% for
	Packard BioScience common stock based on the closing prices for
	the shares of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer common stock on
	the date the merger agreement was executed, the exchange ratio
	represents a historical premium of approximately 18.9% for
	Packard BioScience common stock based upon the average of the
	respective closing sale prices for the shares of Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer common stock for the month prior to
	the signing of the merger agreement.

 

Opportunity to participate in the combined company. 
The
	stock-for-stock transaction structure would allow Packard
	BioScience stockholders to participate in the growth and
	opportunities of the combined company and to continue to have an
	investment in the life sciences industry through a larger and
	more diversified enterprise.

However, there can be no assurances as to the extent, if any,
that the expectations of Packard BioSciences management
will be realized. See the section entitled Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.

In the course of deliberations, the Packard BioScience board of
directors reviewed with Packard BioSciences management and
its legal and financial advisors a number of additional factors
relevant to the merger, including the following:

 

	historical information concerning Packard BioSciences and
	PerkinElmers respective businesses, financial performance
	and condition, operations, management and competitive position,
	including public reports concerning results of operations during
	the most recent fiscal year and fiscal quarter for each company
	filed with the SEC;



 

	the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of
	Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer before and after giving
	effect to the merger based on due diligence by management and
	Packard BioSciences financial and legal advisors;

 

	current financial market conditions and historical market
	prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
	Packard BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock;

 

	the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties
	respective representations, warranties and covenants, the
	conditions to the parties respective obligations, and the
	expected tax-free treatment of the exchange of Packard
	BioScience common stock for PerkinElmer common stock to Packard
	BioSciences stockholders;

 

	the terms of the stockholders agreement and the voting
	agreements described under the section entitled Related
	Agreements  Stockholder and Voting Agreements;

 

	the potential for other third parties to enter into strategic
	relationships with or to acquire Packard BioScience;

 

	the financial presentation of JPMorgan, including
	JPMorgans oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
	to the Packard BioScience board of directors that, as of the
	date of its opinion and based upon and subject to the matters
	stated therein, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from
	a financial point of view, to the Packard BioScience
	stockholders, as described below under the caption
	 Opinion of Packard BioSciences Financial
	Advisor  J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.; and

 

	the impact of the merger on Packard BioSciences employees
	and customers.

The Packard BioScience board of directors also considered the
provisions of the merger agreement regarding Packard
BioSciences rights to consider and negotiate other
acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the
provisions regarding termination fees. The Packard BioScience
board of directors considered various alternatives to the
merger, including remaining as an independent company and
seeking other partners. The Packard BioScience board of
directors noted that there were a number of uncertainties over
the long-term if Packard BioScience remained an independent
company. The Packard BioScience board of directors considered
the probability that Packard BioScience stockholders would
prefer the benefits of being part of a larger, more diversified
entity rather than have Packard BioScience implement a long-term
strategic plan for profitable growth, which would be impacted by
the typical risks associated with implementation, as well as
general market and economic risks. The Packard BioScience board
of directors believed that these factors, including its review
of the terms of the merger agreement, supported the Packard
BioScience board of directors recommendation of the
merger, when viewed together with the risks and potential
benefits of the merger.

The Packard BioScience board of directors considered that in
connection with the merger, Stonington, Packard
BioSciences largest stockholder, and other stockholders,
including executive officers of Packard BioScience, entered into
a stockholders agreement and voting agreements that
obligated these stockholders to vote their shares for the merger
and not to transfer their shares as long as the Packard
BioScience board of directors has not withdrawn or materially,
adversely modified its recommendation of the merger in response
to a superior proposal. Together, these stockholders hold a
majority of the outstanding common stock of Packard BioScience.
Under the stockholders agreement, Stonington would also
receive the right to nominate one director to the PerkinElmer
board of directors and registration rights with respect to the
PerkinElmer shares Stonington would receive in the merger.
However, the Packard BioScience board of directors also noted
that all Packard BioScience stockholders, including Stonington,
would receive the same exchange ratio and that Stonington
therefore would receive the same economic consideration as all
of the other Packard BioScience stockholders. The Packard
BioScience board of directors further noted that Stonington was
the only Packard BioScience stockholder that would require
registration rights with respect to the PerkinElmer shares to be
received in the merger, as virtually all other Packard
BioScience stockholders could freely sell their PerkinElmer
shares, and that Stonington currently has four out of eight
nominees on the Packard BioScience board of directors but would
only have one out of ten nominees on the PerkinElmer board of
directors. The Packard BioScience board of directors was aware
of these



interests, as well as the interests of various other persons in
the merger, and considered them in approving the merger
agreement and the merger. See below under the caption
 Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger.

The Packard BioScience board of directors also identified and
considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger, including but not limited
to:

 

	the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might
	not be fully realized;

 

	the possibility that the merger might not be completed and the
	potential adverse effect of the public announcement of the
	merger on:

 

	Packard BioSciences significant customers and other key
	relationships;

 

	Packard BioSciences ability to attract and retain key
	management, marketing and technical personnel; and

 

	Packard BioSciences overall competitive position;

 

	the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key
	technical and management personnel might choose not to remain
	employed by the combined company; and

 

	the other risks described under the section entitled Risk
	Factors.

The Packard BioScience board of directors believed that these
risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.
The above discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered
by the Packard BioScience board of directors. Each member of
Packard BioSciences board of directors may have considered
different factors, and Packard BioSciences board of
directors evaluated these factors as a whole and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors
considered.

Recommendation of Packard BioSciences Board of
Directors

After careful consideration, Packard BioSciences board of
directors has determined the merger to be fair and in the best
interests of Packard BioScience and its stockholders. Packard
BioSciences board of directors voted unanimously to adopt
the merger agreement and recommends that the Packard BioScience
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the merger. In considering the
recommendation of the Packard BioScience board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, Packard BioScience stockholders
should be aware that some directors and officers of Packard
BioScience have interests in the merger that are different from,
or are in addition to, the interests of Packard BioScience
stockholders generally in the merger. Please see the description
below under the caption  Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger.

PerkinElmers Reasons for the Merger

The PerkinElmer board of directors voted unanimously to approve
the merger agreement and determined that the merger is fair and
in the best interests of PerkinElmer and its stockholders.
Accordingly, PerkinElmers board of directors unanimously
recommends that PerkinElmer stockholders vote FOR the issuance
of 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common stock for each share
of Packard BioScience common stock to be converted in connection
with the merger.

The decision of the PerkinElmer board of directors was based on
several potential benefits of the merger that it believes will
contribute to PerkinElmers success. These potential
benefits include:

 

	growing PerkinElmers position in the life sciences
	research and drug discovery businesses;

 

	enabling PerkinElmer to offer the full spectrum of drug
	discovery tools supported by a broad and focused worldwide
	sales, service and applications capability; and

 

	expanding PerkinElmers product portfolio into the key
	strategic areas of liquid handling and automated sample
	preparation products.



The PerkinElmer board of directors reviewed a number of factors
in evaluating the merger, including but not limited to the
following:

 

	historical information concerning PerkinElmers and Packard
	BioSciences respective business focus, financial
	performance and condition, operations, technology and
	management, including public reports concerning results of
	operations during the most recent fiscal year and fiscal quarter
	for Packard BioScience filed with the SEC;

 

	PerkinElmer managements view of the financial condition,
	results of operations and business of PerkinElmer and Packard
	BioScience before and after giving effect to the merger and the
	determination by the PerkinElmer board of directors of the
	mergers effect on stockholder value;

 

	current financial market conditions and historical stock market
	prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
	PerkinElmer common stock and Packard BioScience common stock;

 

	the consideration PerkinElmer will pay in the merger in light of
	comparable merger transactions;

 

	the terms of the merger agreement;

 

	the impact of the merger on PerkinElmers customers and
	employees;

 

	results of the due diligence investigation conducted by
	PerkinElmers management, accountants, counsel and
	financial advisor; and

 

	the financial presentation of Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
	including the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the PerkinElmer board
	of directors that the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
	agreement was, as of the date of its opinion, fair from a
	financial point of view to PerkinElmer as described below under
	the caption  Opinion of PerkinElmers
	Financial Advisor  Goldman, Sachs & Co.

During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger,
the PerkinElmer board also identified and considered a variety
of potentially negative factors that could materialize as a
result of the merger, including the following:

 

	the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might
	not be fully realized;

 

	the possibility that the merger might not be completed;

 

	the effect of the public announcement of the merger on
	PerkinElmers and Packard BioSciences business,
	including employees and customers;

 

	the risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals
	required to complete the merger; and

 

	other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
	under the section entitled Risk Factors.

PerkinElmers board of directors concluded that these
factors were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.
The above discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered
by PerkinElmers board of directors. Each member of
PerkinElmers board of directors may have considered
different factors, and PerkinElmers board of directors
evaluated these factors as a whole and did not quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the factors considered.

Recommendation of PerkinElmers Board of Directors

After careful consideration, the PerkinElmer board of directors
has determined the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in the
merger to be fair and in the best interests of PerkinElmer and
its stockholders. PerkinElmers board of directors voted
unanimously to approve the merger agreement and the issuance of
PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger and
unanimously recommends that the PerkinElmer stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in the merger.



Opinion of PerkinElmers Financial Advisor 
Goldman, Sachs & Co.

On July 13, 2001, at the meeting of the PerkinElmer board
of directors, Goldman Sachs delivered to the PerkinElmer board
its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in a written
opinion, that as of that date the exchange ratio pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
PerkinElmer.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated
July 13, 2001, which identifies assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in
connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference. You should read the opinion in its entirety. Goldman
Sachs advisory services and the opinion of Goldman Sachs
were provided for the information and assistance of the
PerkinElmer board in connection with its consideration of the
merger and do not constitute a recommendation as to how holders
of PerkinElmer common stock should vote.

In connection with this opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among
other things:

 

	the merger agreement;

 

	the Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the
	Prospectus dated April  20, 2000 contained therein,
	relating to Packard BioSciences initial public offering of
	Packard BioScience common stock;

 

	Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on
	Form 10-K of PerkinElmer for the four years ended
	December 31, 2000, and of Packard BioScience for the year
	ended December 31, 2000;

 

	interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
	Form 10-Q of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience;

 

	other communications from PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience to
	their respective stockholders;

 

	internal financial analyses and forecasts for Packard BioScience
	prepared by its management; and

 

	internal financial analyses and forecasts for Packard BioScience
	and PerkinElmer prepared by PerkinElmers management,
	including certain cost savings and revenue and operating
	synergies forecasted by the management of PerkinElmer to result
	from the merger.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
management of PerkinElmer regarding their assessment of the
strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the
merger and with members of the senior management of PerkinElmer
and Packard BioScience regarding the past and current business
operations, financial condition, and future prospects of their
respective companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

 

	reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Packard
	BioScience common stock and the PerkinElmer common stock;

 

	compared certain financial and stock market information for
	Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer with similar information for
	certain other companies the securities of which are publicly
	traded;

 

	reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
	combinations in the life science industry specifically and in
	other industries generally; and

 

	performed such other studies and analyses as it considered
	appropriate.

Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial, accounting and other information discussed
with or reviewed by it and assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of the
PerkinElmer board, that the financial analyses and forecasts
referred to above, including the cost savings and revenue and
operating synergies referred to above, were reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of PerkinElmer as of the date of its opinion, and that



such forecasted cost savings and synergies would be realized in
the amounts and time periods contemplated thereby. These
forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure.

Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Packard BioScience or
PerkinElmer or any of their subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of
the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on
PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience or on the contemplated
benefits of the merger.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses
used by Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion
dated July 13, 2001 to the PerkinElmer board. This summary
includes information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand fully the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs
these tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. You should understand that the order of analyses and
results derived from these analyses described below do not
represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses
by Goldman Sachs.

Exchange Ratio And Premium Analyses.
 Goldman Sachs
calculated the ratio of the average closing market price of
Packard BioScience common stock to the average closing market
price of PerkinElmer common stock, over selected periods ending
on July 12, 2001, and the resulting implied transaction
premiums as compared with the 0.311 exchange ratio contemplated
by the merger agreement as follows:

Goldman Sachs also calculated as of July 12, 2001 the ratio
of the closing market price of PerkinElmer common stock to the
average closing market price of Packard BioScience common stock
(the last trading day before the signing of the merger
agreement) was 0.311x, which indicated no transaction premium.

Selected Companies Analysis.
 Goldman Sachs reviewed and
compared certain financial information relating to Packard
BioScience to corresponding financial information and public
market multiples for the following five publicly traded
companies in the life sciences industry that, for purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to Packard BioScience:

 

	Applera Corporation;

 

	Millipore Corporation;

 

	Molecular Devices Corporation;

 

	Thermo Electron Corporation; and

 

	Waters Corporation.

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial
multiples and ratios. The multiples for Packard BioScience and
each of the five selected companies were calculated using their
closing prices on July 12, 2001. The multiples and ratios
for Packard BioScience and for each of the selected companies
were based on the most recent publicly available information and
IBES estimates for 2001 earnings.



The results of these analyses are as follows:

Pro Forma Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs prepared a pro forma
analysis of the financial impact of the acquisition. Using
earnings estimates for 2002 and 2003 furnished by PerkinElmer,
Goldman Sachs compared the earnings per share of PerkinElmer
common stock on a stand-alone basis and Packard BioScience
common stock on a stand-alone basis, to the earnings per share
of the common stock of the pro forma combined company. Goldman
Sachs performed this analysis based on the exchange ratio of
0.311 and under two scenarios reflecting cost savings and
operating synergies forecasted by the management of PerkinElmer
to result from the merger:

 

	Scenario I  assuming no synergies; and

 

	Scenario II  assuming $20 million in pre-tax
	synergies are realized in 2002 and $26.5 million in pre-tax
	synergies are realized in 2003.

This analysis indicated that:

 

	assuming Scenario I, the merger would be
	dilutive  that is, would represent a reduction to
	both 2002 and 2003 stand-alone earnings per share of PerkinElmer
	common stock; and

 

	assuming Scenario II, the merger would be dilutive in 2002 and
	accretive in 2003 to the stand-alone earnings per share of
	PerkinElmer common stock.

Selected Transactions Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs analyzed
certain information relating to the proposed transaction in
relation to certain publicly available information for 12
comparable transactions in the life sciences industry. Such
analysis indicated that for the selected transactions the
multiples paid in such transactions compared to:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:
 Goldman Sachs calculated a
range of implied prices per Packard BioScience common share
using a discounted cash flow valuation of estimated free cash
flows through 2005, discount rates ranging from 11% to 13% and
terminal 2005 EBITDA multiples ranging from 10x to 18x. The
estimated free cash flows utilized were prepared by the
management of PerkinElmer and assume a revenue growth of 20%
after 2003. This analysis produced implied prices per Packard
BioScience common share ranging from $6.50 to $12.23 without
synergies and $8.38 to $16.11 with synergies.

Contribution Analysis. 
Goldman Sachs analyzed the
relative income statement contribution of PerkinElmer and
Packard BioScience to the pro forma combined company resulting
from the acquisition and based on forecasts provided by
PerkinElmer. The analysis showed that on a pro forma combined
basis,



both including all revenue and cost synergies and excluding such
synergies, Packard BioScience would account for approximately
the following percentages in 2001-2003 of the combined entity:

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and
is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of
all these analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience or the contemplated transaction.

The analyses were prepared for purposes of Goldman Sachs
providing its opinion to the PerkinElmer board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
to PerkinElmer. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals
or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Analyses based on forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors, none of PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience, Goldman Sachs
or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecasts.

Although Goldman Sachs evaluated the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the exchange ratio to PerkinElmer, the
exchange ratio itself was determined by PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience through arms-length negotiations. PerkinElmer
did not provide specific instructions to, or place any
limitations on, Goldman Sachs with respect to the procedures to
be followed or factors to be considered by Goldman Sachs in
performing its analyses or providing its opinion.

As described above, Goldman Sachs opinion to the
PerkinElmer board was among many factors taken into
consideration by the PerkinElmer board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with such
opinion and is qualified by reference to the written opinion of
Goldman Sachs set forth in Annex B.

Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with PerkinElmer, having
provided certain investment banking services to PerkinElmer from
time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with its acquisition of PerkinElmers Analytical
Instruments Business in June 1999 and its divestiture of
EG&G Technical Services business in August 1999; having
acted as lead managing underwriter with respect to the sale of
$460,000,000 Zero Coupon Convertible Notes of PerkinElmer in
August 2000; and having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with, and having participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.

PerkinElmer selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor
because it is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to
the merger.

Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and
securities services and, in the course of its normal trading
activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold
securities including,



derivatives securities, of PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience for
its own account and for the account of customers.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated July 13, 2001,
PerkinElmer engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the
terms of this engagement letter, PerkinElmer agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs a fee of $5.5 million upon the consummation of the
merger. PerkinElmer also agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees
and disbursements of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Goldman
Sachs and related parties against certain liabilities arising
out of or in connection with Goldman Sachs engagement. In
the past, Goldman Sachs, in the ordinary course of business, has
from time to time provided investment banking services to
PerkinElmer for which Goldman Sachs received usual and customary
compensation, and in the future may continue to provide such
services.

Opinion of Packard BioSciences Financial
Advisor  J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

JPMorgan acted as Packard BioSciences financial advisor in
connection with the merger. Packard BioScience requested
JPMorgan, in its role as a financial advisor, to evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
in the merger to the holders of Packard BioScience common stock.
On July 13, 2001, JPMorgan delivered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Packard BioScience
board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to certain matters stated therein, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Packard BioScience common stock.

The full text of the JPMorgan fairness opinion, which sets
forth the assumptions made, factors considered and limitations
upon the review undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its opinion,
is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.
JPMorgans written opinion was addressed to the Packard
BioScience board of directors, was directed only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
in the merger to the holders of Packard BioScience common stock
and does not constitute a recommendation to any Packard
BioScience stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote on
the merger or any other matter. The following summary of the
material provisions of the JPMorgan fairness opinion is
qualified by reference to such opinion. Packard BioScience
stockholders are urged to read this opinion in its entirety.

In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:

 

	reviewed the merger agreement;

 

	reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
	information concerning Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer and
	the industries in which they operate;

 

	compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the
	publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
	involving companies JPMorgan deemed relevant and the
	consideration received for such companies;

 

	compared the financial and operating performance of Packard
	BioScience and PerkinElmer with publicly available information
	concerning certain other companies JPMorgan deemed relevant;

 

	reviewed the current and historical market prices of Packard
	BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock and certain
	publicly traded securities of such other companies;

 

	reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts
	prepared by the managements of Packard BioScience and
	PerkinElmer relating to their respective businesses, as well as
	the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related
	expenses and synergies that Packard BioScience expects to result
	from the merger; and

 

	performed such other financial studies and analyses and
	considered such other information as JPMorgan deemed appropriate
	for the purposes of its opinion.



JPMorgan also held discussions with certain members of the
management of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer with respect to
certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business
operations of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer and certain other matters believed
necessary or appropriate to JPMorgans inquiry.

In rendering its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed,
without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of all information that was publicly available or that was
furnished to it by Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer or
otherwise reviewed by it, and JPMorgan did not assume any
responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan did not conduct
any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
were any valuations or appraisals provided to it. In relying on
financial analyses and forecasts provided to it, including the
synergies provided by Packard BioScience, JPMorgan assumed that
they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments by
management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer to
which such analyses or forecasts relate. In addition, JPMorgan
assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes,
and that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement will be completed as described in the
merger agreement. JPMorgan relied as to all legal matters
relevant to the rendering of its opinion upon the advice of
counsel. JPMorgan further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the completion of the merger will be obtained
without any adverse effect on Packard BioScience or PerkinElmer
or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

The forecasts furnished to JPMorgan for Packard BioScience and
PerkinElmer were prepared by the managements of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer, respectively. Neither Packard
BioScience nor PerkinElmer publicly discloses internal
management forecasts of the type provided to JPMorgan in
connection with JPMorgans analysis of the exchange ratio
in the merger, and such forecasts were not prepared with a view
toward public disclosure. These forecasts were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may
be beyond the control of the respective managements, including,
without limitation, factors related to general economic and
competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those
set forth in such forecasts.

JPMorgans opinion was necessarily based on economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to JPMorgan as of, the date of its opinion.
Subsequent developments may affect the opinion, and JPMorgan
does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such
opinion. JPMorgans opinion was limited to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Packard
BioScience common stock of the exchange ratio in the merger, and
JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the underlying decision of
Packard BioScience to engage in the merger. JPMorgan expressed
no opinion as to the price at which Packard BioScience common
stock or PerkinElmer common stock will trade at any future time.

JPMorgans opinion noted that JPMorgan was not authorized
to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any
other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of
Packard BioScience or any other alternative transaction.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice,
JPMorgan employed generally accepted valuation methods in
reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of certain of
the financial analyses presented to the Packard BioScience board
of directors at its meeting on July 13, 2001, which
analyses were also among those considered by JPMorgan in
connection with delivering its opinion. Some of the analyses
include information presented in a tabular format. To understand
fully the financial analyses used by JPMorgan, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. This summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses underlying the opinion of JPMorgan.

Precedent Transactions Analysis.
 JPMorgan reviewed
certain publicly available information regarding selected
business combinations in the life sciences technology industry
announced since August 1997. These transactions and the
month in which each transaction was announced were as follows:

 

	Aurora Biosciences Corporation/ Vertex Pharmaceuticals
	Incorporated (April  2001);

 

	GSI Life Sciences (a division of GSI Lumonics, Inc.)/ Packard
	BioScience (August 2000);

 

	Dexter Corporation/ Invitrogen Corporation (July 2000);

 

	NEN Life Sciences, Inc./ PerkinElmer (June 2000);

 

	Operon Technologies, Inc./ Qiagen N.V. (June 2000);

 

	LJL Biosystems, Inc./ Molecular Devices Corporation
	(June 2000);

 

	Genetic Microsystems, Inc./ Affymetrix, Inc.
	(September 1999);

 

	Molecular Dynamics, Inc./ Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.
	(August 1998); and

 

	PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc./ Applera Corporation (formerly known
	as Perkin-Elmer Corporation) (August 1997).

This analysis indicated that the transaction value as a multiple
of last twelve-months revenues, adjusted to reflect the change
in the index of stocks comprising the public companies listed
above in the public companies analysis for Packard BioScience
from the date of each transaction to July 12, 2001, ranged
from approximately 1.4x to 12.7x, with a mean of approximately
4.1x and a median of approximately 4.6x.

Based upon the precedent transactions for Packard BioScience and
the public companies analysis for PerkinElmer set forth above,
JPMorgan calculated an implied exchange ratio by comparing the
implied per share equity values of Packard BioScience common
stock and PerkinElmer common stock. The analysis yielded the
following implied exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest
thousandth), in each case compared to the proposed exchange
ratio of 0.311:

Relative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
 JPMorgan
performed discounted cash flow analyses for each of Packard
BioScience and PerkinElmer using:

 

	financial forecasts for Packard BioScience provided by Packard
	BioScience for years 2001 through 2005, and financial forecasts
	for PerkinElmer provided by PerkinElmer for years 2001 through
	2004, with 2005 extrapolated based on 2004 growth rates and
	margins; and

 

	estimated synergies provided by Packard BioScience.

JPMorgan calculated a discounted cash flow analysis for Packard
BioScience assuming discount rates ranging from 12% to 15%, and
terminal multiples of EBIT in the year 2005 ranging from 15.0x
to 20.0x, and for PerkinElmer assuming discount rates ranging
from 9.0% to 13.0%, and terminal multiples of EBITDA in the year
2005 ranging from 11.0x to 13.0x. Based upon the estimated
valuation ranges of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer set forth
above, JPMorgan calculated an implied exchange ratio of a share
of PerkinElmer common stock to a share of Packard BioScience
common stock. The analysis yielded the following implied
exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest thousandth), in each
case compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

JPMorgan also performed discounted cash flow analyses for each
of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer using financial forecasts
for Packard BioScience from publicly available data and research
analyst estimates and financial forecasts for PerkinElmer from
PerkinElmer management. Using the same discount rates and
terminal multiples described above, JPMorgan calculated an
implied exchange ratio of a share of PerkinElmer common stock to
a share of Packard BioScience common stock. The analysis yielded
the following implied exchange ratios (rounded to the nearest

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
 JPMorgan reviewed the
per share daily closing market price movements of Packard
BioScience common stock and PerkinElmer common stock for the
one-year period ending July 12, 2001, and calculated the
historical exchange ratios during this period implied by dividing



the daily closing prices per share of Packard BioScience common
stock by those of PerkinElmer common stock and the average of
those historical trading ratios for the one-day, one-month,
three-month, six-month and one-year periods ending July 12,
2001. The analysis resulted in the following average historical
trading ratios for the periods indicated (rounded to the nearest
hundredth), compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

The highest historical exchange ratio on any single day during
the 1-year period was approximately 0.843x, and the lowest
historical exchange ratio on any single day during this period
was approximately 0.163x, compared to the proposed exchange
ratio of 0.311x.

Contribution Analysis. 
JPMorgan estimated the
contribution of each of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer to
the pro forma combined company with respect to revenue, earnings
before interest, taxes and amortization, which is referred to as
EBITA, and earnings for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 using
financial forecasts for Packard BioScience provided by Packard
BioScience and for PerkinElmer provided by PerkinElmer. The
analysis showed that Packard BioScience would contribute
approximately the following percentages of estimated revenues,
EBITA and earnings in 2001 and 2002:

compared to the approximately 17.6% pro forma ownership of the
combined company by Packard BioScience stockholders.

Based upon the contribution analysis set forth above, JPMorgan
calculated an implied exchange ratio of a share of PerkinElmer
common stock to a share of Packard BioScience common stock. The
analysis yielded the following implied exchange ratios (rounded
to the nearest thousandth), in each case compared to the
proposed exchange ratio of 0.311:

Pro Forma Analysis.
 JPMorgan also analyzed certain pro
forma effects resulting from the merger, including the potential
impact of the merger on forecasted earnings per share of
PerkinElmer following the merger, using earnings per share
forecasts for Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer provided by the
managements of Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, respectively,
for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The following table reflects the
accretion/ dilution analysis assuming varying levels of
synergies, 50% of which are achieved in 2002 and 100% of which
are achieved in 2003:

The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is
not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. JPMorgan believes that the summary set forth above
and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions thereof, without considering all of its
analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan based its analyses
on assumptions that it deemed reasonable, including assumptions
concerning general business and economic conditions and
industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon
which JPMorgan based its analyses are set forth above under the
description of each such analysis. JPMorgans analyses are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future
results that might be achieved, which values may be higher or
lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgans analyses
are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise
reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be
bought or sold.

None of the public companies used in the public companies
analysis described above is identical to Packard BioScience or
PerkinElmer, and none of the precedent transactions used in the
precedent transactions analysis described above is identical to
the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly traded
comparable companies and transactions is not mathematical;
rather it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors
that could affect the public trading value of the comparable
companies or company to which they are being compared.

As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its
affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
estate, corporate and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to
advise Packard BioScience with respect to the merger and deliver
an opinion to the Packard BioScience board of directors with
respect to the exchange ratio in the merger on the basis of such
experience and its familiarity with Packard BioScience.

For services rendered in connection with the merger and the
delivery of its opinion, Packard BioScience has agreed to pay
JPMorgan a fee equal to 0.70% of the aggregate consideration
paid at the closing of the merger, measured at the date of
closing of the merger and including Packard BioScience debt
assumed by PerkinElmer, payable upon the closing of the merger.
In addition, Packard BioScience has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan
for its expenses incurred in connection with its services,
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will
indemnify JPMorgan against certain liabilities, including
liabilities arising under the Federal securities laws.

In the past, JPMorgan and its affiliates, in the ordinary course
of business, have from time to time provided investment banking
and commercial banking services to Packard BioScience and
PerkinElmer, respectively, for which JPMorgan received usual and
customary compensation, and in the future may continue to
provide such services. An affiliate of JPMorgan holds a limited
partnership interest in Stonington Capital Appreciation Fund
1994, L.P., representing approximately 0.75% of the total
capital commitments in the fund.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their businesses,
JPMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and
equity securities of Packard BioScience or PerkinElmer for their
own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,
they may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

When Packard BioScience stockholders consider the recommendation
of the board with respect to the merger, they should be aware
that some officers and directors of Packard BioScience have
interests in connection with the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the Packard BioScience
stockholders, as summarized below. In making their decision to
recommend the merger, the



Packard BioScience board was aware of these interests and
considered them among the other matters described above under
the section entitled The Merger  Packard
BioSciences Reasons for the Merger.

Employment Agreements.
 Packard BioScience has entered
into employment agreements with Emery G. Olcott,
Franklin R. Witney, Ben D. Kaplan, Staf C.
van Cauter, and Timothy O. White, Jr. Each of the
employment agreements provides for an initial employment term of
two years, except for an initial employment term of three years
in the case of Mr. Kaplan. Under each employment agreement,
the initial employment term is automatically extended for
additional 25-month terms (13-month terms for Dr. Witney
and Mr. van Cauter) on a specified initial renewal
date and on the first day of each calendar month that follows
the initial renewal date, unless Packard BioScience
affirmatively gives 60 days notice that it will not be
renewing the agreement on a renewal date. The initial renewal
date has already occurred for each of the executives other than
Dr. Witney, whose initial employment term continues until
December 18, 2002, and whose initial renewal date is
December 18, 2001 (see a description of
Dr. Witneys new employment arrangement with
PerkinElmer described below).

Under these employment agreements, upon a termination of the
executives employment by Packard BioScience other than for
cause, death or disability,
or upon a termination of employment by the executive for
good reason (as such terms are defined in the
employment agreements), the executive would be entitled to an
amount in cash equal to the sum of: (i) the accrued annual
base salary as of the date of termination; (ii) a pro rata
portion of the target annual bonus accrued to the date of
termination and any other accrued but unpaid annual bonuses;
(iii) accrued vacation pay and deferred compensation not
yet paid; (iv) annual base salary and annual bonus amounts
for the remainder of the employment term (or, in the case of Dr.
Witney, for the longer of the remainder of his employment term
or 180 days); and (v) additional contributions to the
thrift savings plan, if any, to which the executive would have
been entitled had his employment continued for a period of two
years (three years in the case of Mr. Olcott) after the
date of termination. In addition, the executive would be
entitled to participate in all welfare benefit plans for a
period of two years (three years in the case of Mr. Olcott)
after the date of termination on terms at least as favorable as
those that would have been applicable had his employment not
been terminated (or, if such benefit plans are not available,
the executive will receive a cash payment of comparable value),
and, to the extent that any form of compensation or benefits is
not fully vested, the executive would be credited with
additional service of two years (three years in the case of
Mr. Olcott and Dr. Witney) after the date of
termination. Mr. Olcott would additionally be entitled to
continue to receive all perquisites that he had been receiving
at the time of the termination of his employment, for a period
of three years.

In addition, the executive would be entitled to a gross
up payment reimbursing the executive on an after-tax basis
for any excise tax liability incurred by the executive with
respect to payments made in connection with a change of control
under the agreement, unless a reduction of less than $30,000 in
the payments due to the executive would result in the avoidance
of the excise tax, in which case the payments would be so
reduced. Both Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer have agreed in
the merger agreement that consummation of the merger will
trigger the right in the employment agreements of
Messrs. Olcott, Kaplan, van Cauter, and White to terminate
employment for good reason. If these executive
officers were to terminate employment for good
reason immediately upon consummation of the merger, and
assuming that consummation of the merger occurs on
December 31, 2001, they would be entitled to the following
approximate severance amounts under their contracts. These
amounts do not include any accrued base salary, vacation, or
deferred compensation, any welfare benefits continuation or
accelerated vesting, or any gross-up payments:

 Mr. Olcott

$

1,735,500;

 Mr. Kaplan

$

934,500;

 Mr. van Cauter

$

382,500;

and

 Mr. White

$

586,000.

Each of the employment agreements (other than those of
Messrs. Kaplan and White) provides that, during the
employment of the executives and for a stated period after the
termination of the employment



term, each executive will not solicit any of our employees or
compete with us. In consideration for such noncompetition and
nonsolicitation covenants, Packard BioScience will pay to each
executive one-half of the sum of his annual base salary and his
target annual bonus (100% in the case of Mr. Olcott), such
amount payable in equal monthly installments during the portion
of the relevant restricted period following the date of
termination.

Witney Employment Agreement.
 In connection with the
merger, PerkinElmer and Dr. Witney entered into a new
employment arrangement, contingent upon consummation of the
merger. This new arrangement will supersede
Dr. Witneys present employment agreement with Packard
BioScience, described above, upon completion of the merger. The
new employment arrangement generally retains the obligation of
Packard BioScience to provide excise tax gross up
payments to Dr. Witney in the event that he becomes subject
to change of control related excise taxes with respect to
payments and benefits Dr. Witney receives in connection
with the merger, with PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience as
joint obligors.

The new arrangement provides for Dr. Witneys
employment as a Vice President of PerkinElmer, effective upon
completion of the merger. Dr. Witney will receive a
starting annual base salary of $300,000. In addition, he will be
provided with a stock option grant to purchase 150,000 shares of
PerkinElmer common stock under the PerkinElmer, Inc. 2001
Incentive Plan, with a grant price equal to the average of the
high and the low price of PerkinElmer common stock on the date
of the grant (the date Dr. Witney accepted the offer, July
12, 2001), which will vest generally on a performance basis.
PerkinElmer will grant Dr. Witney 5,000 restricted shares
of PerkinElmer common stock that will also vest on a performance
basis. Dr. Witney will be granted an additional 15,000
restricted shares of PerkinElmer common stock that will vest one
year from the closing date of the merger. Dr. Witneys
employment arrangement will have a one-year term, renewable on a
yearly basis by the board of directors of PerkinElmer.
Dr. Witney will be eligible to participate in any and all
bonus, benefit, pension, compensation, and option plans which,
pursuant to PerkinElmer policy, are available to persons in
similar positions within PerkinElmer. In addition, PerkinElmer
has agreed to provide Dr. Witney with a company-paid
apartment in the Boston area with a lease cost of up to $3,500 a
month.

Dr. Witneys employment agreement provides for certain
benefits in the event PerkinElmer experiences a change of
control (as defined in the agreement). Under such a
circumstance, PerkinElmer will continue to employ Dr. Witney in
a management position for three years following the date of the
change of control. The agreement also provides that if
Dr. Witney is terminated other than for cause
(as defined in the agreement) during the three years following
the change of control of PerkinElmer, or if Dr. Witney
terminates his employment for good reason (as
defined in the agreement) within this three-year period,
Dr. Witney will be entitled to receive a lump-sum severance
payment generally equal to the sum of (1) his unpaid base
salary through the date of termination, (2) a pro rata
bonus for the year of termination and (3) three times the
sum of his annual base salary plus any bonus or incentive
payments received by Dr. Witney in the last full fiscal
year of PerkinElmer. Also, for this three-year period,
Dr. Witney will be eligible to participate in all employee
benefit plans and arrangements of PerkinElmer to the same extent
and on the same terms as were effective immediately prior to his
termination. An additional excise tax gross-up
payment would be required under the employment agreement to
compensate Dr. Witney in the event that any golden
parachute excise taxes are levied upon him in connection with a
change of control of PerkinElmer.

Accelerated Vesting of Stock Options and Restricted
Stock.
 Pursuant to Packard BioSciences 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Option Compensation
Plan, all stock options held by Packard BioScience employees and
directors will fully vest upon consummation of the merger. The
restrictions upon all restricted stock granted under Packard
BioSciences 2000 Stock Incentive Plan will lapse upon
consummation of the merger. Messrs. Olcott, Witney, Kaplan,
van Cauter, and White currently hold, respectively, 136,250,
131,250, 72,000, 34,000 and 45,450 unvested Packard BioScience
options, all of which will vest upon consummation of the merger
(to the extent that they do not vest sooner in accordance with
their normal vesting schedules). Dr. Witney holds 100,000
shares of Packard BioScience



restricted stock, the restrictions upon which will lapse upon
consummation of the merger (to the extent that they do not lapse
sooner in accordance with their normal vesting schedules).

Retention Bonuses.
 In connection with the merger, Packard
BioScience is implementing a retention bonus program to
encourage certain employees to remain with Packard BioScience
until and shortly after the merger, and has set aside
approximately $6,600,000 for this retention program. Pursuant to
this program, it is currently anticipated that Dr. Witney
will receive a bonus of approximately $900,000 if he remains
employed by Packard BioScience through the date of the
consummation of the merger. No other executive officers of
Packard BioScience will participate in the retention program.

401(k) Plan.
 The merger agreement grants PerkinElmer the
right to require that Packard BioScience terminate its 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction.
If the 401(k) Plan is so terminated, all unvested employer
matching contributions to the plan will immediately vest upon
such termination, pursuant to the terms of the plan. As of
July 27, 2001, Mr. White held unvested matching
contributions with an approximate value of $4,068.39.
Mr. White is the only executive officer of Packard
BioScience who has unvested employer matching contributions to
the plan.

Indemnification. 
The merger agreement provides that
PerkinElmer will indemnify Packard BioScience officers and
directors against matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the effective time of the merger for six years after the merger.
See the section entitled The Merger Agreement 
Covenants of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience 
Director and Officer Indemnification.

Interests of Other Stockholders. 
Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., Packard BioSciences largest
stockholder, entered into a stockholders agreement with
PerkinElmer in connection with the merger.

Under the stockholders agreement, Stonington is obligated
to vote 30,898,890 shares of Packard BioScience common stock,
and to direct the vote of 1,123,590 shares of Packard BioScience
common stock over which Stonington has the power to direct the
vote, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
Stonington has also agreed not to transfer any of the shares
that it owns and not to consent to the transfer of the shares
over which it has the power to direct the vote, as long as the
Packard BioScience board of directors does not withdraw or
knowingly modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation
of the merger in response to a superior proposal in accordance
with, and subject to the limitations of, the merger agreement.
In addition, Stonington is entitled to registration rights with
respect to the PerkinElmer stock it would receive in the merger
and may nominate one director to the PerkinElmer board of
directors.

Richard T. McKernan, Virginia J. McKernan, Barbara P. Olcott,
Emery G. Olcott, the Timothy S. Olcott Trust, Timothy O. White,
Jr. and Franklin R. Witney have also each entered into voting
agreements with PerkinElmer, which require them to vote a total
of 2,374,875 shares of Packard BioScience common stock owned by
them to adopt the merger agreement, as long as the Packard
BioScience board of directors does not withdraw or knowingly
modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation of the
merger in response to a superior proposal in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations of, the merger agreement. See the
section entitled Related Agreements 
Stockholder and Voting Agreements.

In addition, PerkinElmer and Mr. Olcott have discussed the
possibility of entering into a consulting arrangement, under
which Mr. Olcott would provide consulting services related
to integration issues from the merger.

Treatment of Packard BioScience Common Stock

In the merger, each share of Packard BioScience common stock
will be converted into the right to receive 0.311 of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock.

Holders of Packard BioScience common stock should not send in
any certificates representing Packard BioScience common stock.
Following the effective time of the merger, holders of Packard
BioScience common stock will receive instructions for the
surrender and exchange of their stock certificates.



Accounting Treatment of the Merger

In accordance with the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger, as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmers financial statements prospectively as of the
completion of the merger.

Effect on PerkinElmer Stock Options and Warrants

No adjustment to any outstanding PerkinElmer stock options or
warrants will occur as a result of the merger.

Regulatory Approvals

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
PerkinElmer may not complete the acquisition of shares of
Packard BioScience common stock in the merger until
notifications have been furnished to the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice and the required waiting periods have been satisfied
or terminated. The obligation to file falls upon PerkinElmer, as
the acquiring company, and upon Stonington Capital Appreciation
1994 Fund, L.P., due to its control of Packard BioScience, the
acquired company. This control, as defined by the pre-merger
notification rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission,
derives from Stoningtons ability to designate 50% or more
of the directors of Packard BioScience. The initial waiting
period is 30 days after both PerkinElmer and Stonington
have filed their required pre-merger notification and report
forms. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission or the
Antitrust Division may issue, during the initial waiting period,
a second request, requiring PerkinElmer and Stonington to submit
additional information and documentary materials. If such a
second request were to be issued, it would extend the waiting
period until a date 30 days after PerkinElmer and
Stonington substantially complied with their obligations under
the second request. However, if either the initial or second
30-day period ends on a weekend or legal holiday, then the
waiting period is extended to the next business day. PerkinElmer
and Stonington each filed a pre-merger notification and report
form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division on July 20, 2001. In addition, prior to closing
the merger, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience must make any
necessary filings with, and satisfy any applicable waiting
periods imposed by, foreign and other antitrust authorities
where the failure to file or satisfy would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on PerkinElmer
or Packard BioScience.

At any time before the effective time of the merger, the
Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission or a private
person or entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other
things, to enjoin the merger and any time after the effective
time of the merger, to cause PerkinElmer to divest itself, in
whole or in part, of the surviving corporation of the merger or
of businesses conducted by the surviving corporation of the
merger. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger
will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, PerkinElmer
will prevail. The obligations of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience to complete the merger is subject to the condition
that any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act shall have expired or terminated. See the section entitled
The Merger Agreement  Conditions to Obligations
to Complete the Merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

The discussion below summarizes the anticipated material United
States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to
United States holders of Packard BioScience common stock who,
pursuant to the merger, exchange their Packard BioScience common
stock solely for PerkinElmer common



stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. This discussion is
based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, currently applicable United States Treasury regulations
and judicial and administrative decisions and rulings. This
discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service.
Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
interpretations could alter or modify the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion, and these changes or
interpretations could be retroactive and could affect the tax
consequences of the merger to PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience
and the stockholders of Packard BioScience.

The discussion below does not deal with all aspects of federal
income taxation that may affect particular stockholders in light
of their individual circumstances, and is not intended for
stockholders subject to special treatment under federal income
tax law. Stockholders subject to special treatment include
insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial
institutions, broker-dealers, foreign individuals and entities,
stockholders who hold their stock as part of a hedge,
appreciated financial position, constructive sale, straddle or
conversion transaction, stockholders who do not hold their stock
as capital assets and stockholders who have acquired their stock
upon exercise of employee options or otherwise as compensation.
In addition, the discussion below does not consider the effect
of any applicable state, local or foreign tax laws. In addition,
this discussion does not address the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently
with, the merger, whether or not such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger or the consequences of
the assumption by PerkinElmer of outstanding Packard BioScience
stock options.

The following discussion is not intended to be a complete
analysis or description of all potential United States federal
income tax consequences or any other tax consequences of the
merger. In addition, the discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may vary with a stockholders individual
circumstances.

Holders of Packard BioScience common stock are urged to
consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences
to them as a result of the merger, including the applicability
and effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws, and of
changes in applicable tax laws.

The parties have structured the merger so that it is anticipated
that the merger will be a reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. Completion of the merger is conditioned on
PerkinElmers receipt of an opinion from Hale and Dorr LLP
and Packard BioSciences receipt of an opinion from
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to the effect that the merger
will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The opinions of Hale and Dorr LLP and
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz will be based on the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in the
opinions, including representations contained in certificates
executed by officers of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience. The
opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service or the courts will not take a contrary view. No ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be sought.

Assuming the merger is treated for federal income tax purposes
as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the limitations and
qualifications referred to in this discussion, the following tax
consequences will result:

 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by PerkinElmer or Packard
	BioScience solely as a result of the merger;

 

	No gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Packard
	BioScience common stock upon the receipt of PerkinElmer common
	stock solely in exchange for Packard BioScience common stock in
	the merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of
	fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock;

 

	Cash payments received by holders of Packard BioScience common
	stock in lieu of fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock
	generally will be treated as capital gain or loss measured by
	the difference between the cash payment received and the portion
	of the tax basis in the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered that is allocable to the fractional share. Any gain
	or loss will



	be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held
	the Packard BioScience common stock for more than one year at
	the effective time of the merger;

 

	The total tax basis of a Packard BioScience stockholder in the
	PerkinElmer common stock received in exchange for Packard
	BioScience common stock in the merger will be the same as the
	total tax basis of the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered in the exchange, reduced by the amount of any tax
	basis allocable to any fractional share for which cash is
	received; and

 

	The holding period of the PerkinElmer common stock received by
	each Packard BioScience stockholder in the merger will include
	the holding period for the Packard BioScience common stock
	surrendered in the exchange if the Packard BioScience common
	stock surrendered is held as a capital asset at the effective
	time of the merger.

A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the
reorganization status of the merger would generally
result in a Packard BioScience stockholder recognizing gain or
loss with respect to shares of Packard BioScience common stock
surrendered in the merger equal to the difference between the
Packard BioScience stockholders basis in those shares and
the fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger,
of the PerkinElmer common stock received in exchange for those
shares. In the event of a successful challenge, a Packard
BioScience stockholders total tax basis in the PerkinElmer
common stock received generally would equal its fair market
value as of the effective time of the merger, and the Packard
BioScience stockholders holding period for the stock would
begin the day after the merger.

In connection with the filing of the registration statement of
which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part,
PerkinElmer has received an opinion of Hale and Dorr LLP and
Packard BioScience has received an opinion of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz to the effect that the foregoing discussion
under Material United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations, insofar as it describes the United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger, is accurate in
all material respects. Those legal opinions are included as
exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the registration statement.

Resales of PerkinElmer Common Stock Issued in Connection with
the Merger; Affiliate Agreements

PerkinElmer common stock issued in connection with the merger
will be freely transferable, except that shares of PerkinElmer
common stock received by persons who are deemed to be
affiliates, as the term is defined by Rule 144
under the Securities Act, of Packard BioScience or become
affiliates of PerkinElmer following the effective
time of the merger may be resold by them only in transactions
permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
Act.

No Appraisal Rights

PerkinElmer stockholders and Packard BioScience stockholders are
not entitled to exercise dissenters or appraisal rights as
a result of the merger or to demand payment for their shares
under applicable law.

Delisting and Deregistration of Packard BioScience Common
Stock Following the Merger

If the merger is completed, Packard BioSciences common
stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will
be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.



THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a brief summary of the material provisions
of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference into this summary. While we believe that this summary
covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to
Packard BioScience stockholders and PerkinElmer stockholders. We
urge all Packard BioScience stockholders and PerkinElmer
stockholders to read the merger agreement in its entirety for a
more complete description of the terms and conditions of the
merger and related matters.

General

Following the adoption of the merger agreement by the
stockholders of Packard BioScience, the approval by PerkinElmer
stockholders of the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock to the
stockholders of Packard BioScience and the satisfaction or
waiver of the other conditions to the merger, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PerkinElmer named Pablo Acquisition
Corp. will be merged into Packard BioScience. Packard
BioScience will be the surviving entity of the merger and will
then be a wholly-owned subsidiary of PerkinElmer. If all
conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger
will become effective at the time of the filing of a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The Exchange Ratio and Treatment of Packard BioScience Common
Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding
share of Packard BioScience common stock will be converted into
the right to receive 0.311 of a share of PerkinElmer common
stock. However, shares of Packard BioScience common stock held
in the treasury of Packard BioScience or by any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and shares held by PerkinElmer or any
of its wholly-owned subsidiaries will be canceled without
conversion. The exchange ratio will be adjusted for any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar change with
respect to PerkinElmer common stock or Packard BioScience common
stock, occurring after the date of the merger agreement and
before the effective time.

Based on the exchange ratio of 0.311 and the number of shares of
Packard BioScience common stock outstanding on
[          ],
2001, a total of approximately [     ]
shares of PerkinElmer common stock will be issued in the merger.

Treatment of Packard BioScience Stock Options

At the effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will assume
Packard BioSciences stock option plans (other than its
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which will be terminated) and each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Packard BioScience
common stock, which will then be options to purchase shares of
PerkinElmer common stock. All unexercisable Packard BioScience
stock options will become fully exercisable as a result of the
merger. The number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock
issuable upon the exercise of Packard BioScience stock options
assumed by PerkinElmer in the merger will be adjusted by
multiplying the number of shares of Packard BioScience common
stock subject to the stock option prior to the merger by the
exchange ratio of 0.311. The number of shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options assumed by PerkinElmer in the merger
will be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The exercise price per share under each Packard BioScience stock
option will also be adjusted by dividing the exercise price per
share for the Packard BioScience common stock subject to the
stock option prior to the merger by the exchange ratio of 0.311.
The exercise price of stock options assumed by PerkinElmer in
the merger will be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

PerkinElmer has reserved for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of its common stock for delivery if a Packard BioScience
optionholder exercises its options as described above. After the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the
assumed Packard BioScience stock options. During the period that
any options remain outstanding, PerkinElmer



will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of this registration statement on Form S-8.

Exchange of Certificates

Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; No Further Ownership
Rights.
 As soon as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmers exchange agent
will mail to each record holder of Packard BioScience common
stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering
their certificates. Only those holders who properly surrender
their certificates in accordance with the instructions will
receive certificates representing shares of PerkinElmer common
stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of PerkinElmer
common stock, and any dividends or distributions to which they
are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares
of Packard BioScience common stock will be canceled.

After the effective time of the merger, under the merger
agreement, each certificate representing shares of Packard
BioScience common stock that has not been surrendered will only
represent the right to receive:

 

	shares of PerkinElmer common stock;

 

	cash in lieu of any fractional shares of PerkinElmer common
	stock; and

 

	any dividends or distributions on shares of PerkinElmer common
	stock after the effective time of the merger.

Following the effective time of the merger, Packard BioScience
will not register any transfers of shares of Packard BioScience
common stock on its stock transfer books.

No Fractional Shares. 
PerkinElmer will not issue any
fractional shares of PerkinElmer common stock in the merger.
Instead, each holder of shares of Packard BioScience common
stock converted in connection with the merger who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
PerkinElmer common stock will receive cash, without interest, in
an amount equal to the product of the fractional share
multiplied by the weighted average of the per share selling
price of PerkinElmer common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day prior to the effective time of the merger. As of the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will deposit with its
exchange agent the shares of PerkinElmer common stock issuable
in connection with the merger and cash in an amount sufficient
to cover any payment in lieu of fractional shares or any
dividends or distributions.

Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. 
No
dividends or other distributions declared or made on or after
the effective time of the merger with respect to shares of
PerkinElmer common stock will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Packard BioScience certificate with respect to the
shares of PerkinElmer common stock that the holder is entitled
to receive, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
will be paid to the holder until the holder surrenders its
Packard BioScience certificate. Upon surrender of the
certificate, PerkinElmer will pay to the record holder of the
certificate, without interest, any dividends or distributions
with respect to the shares of PerkinElmer common stock which
have a record date on or after the effective time of the merger
and have become payable between the effective time of the merger
and the time of surrender.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. 
If any
certificate representing shares of Packard BioScience common
stock is lost, stolen or destroyed, a Packard BioScience
stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact
to PerkinElmer. PerkinElmer may also require the Packard
BioScience stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against PerkinElmer with respect to
any certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Only upon receipt of the affidavit, and bond, if requested, will
PerkinElmers exchange agent issue the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock, any cash payable for fractional
shares, and any dividends or distributions that have become
payable between the effective time of the merger and the time of
surrender.



Holders of Packard BioScience common stock should not send in
their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal
from the exchange agent.

Covenants of PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience

Conduct of Packard BioSciences Business Prior to the
Merger. 
Except as contemplated by the merger agreement or
consented to in writing by PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience has
agreed that it will carry on its business in the ordinary course
and use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with past
practices, to maintain its business organization, assets and
properties. Specifically, Packard BioScience has agreed that,
with specified exceptions and except as disclosed on the
disclosure schedule to the merger agreement, neither it nor any
of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of
PerkinElmer:

 

	declare, set aside or pay any dividends or other distributions
	on its shares of capital stock;

 

	effect a stock split, combine or reclassify any of its capital
	stock;

 

	purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital

Conduct of PerkinElmers Business Prior to the
Merger.
 Except as contemplated by the merger agreement,
PerkinElmer has agreed that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with past practice to maintain its business
organization. In addition, PerkinElmer has agreed that neither
it nor its subsidiaries will:

 

	make any amendment to its articles of organization that changes
	the fundamental attributes of PerkinElmer common stock;

 

	make any material changes to the certificate of incorporation of
	Pablo Acquisition Corp.;

	for the purpose of directly or indirectly preventing, materially
	delaying or materially impeding, or that would reasonably be
	expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede, the
	consummation of the merger.

Packard BioScience is Restricted from Trying to Sell to
Another Party.
 Packard BioScience has agreed that until the
effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, whichever



first occurs, it will not and will not cause, authorize or
permit any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or its or their
representatives to, directly or indirectly:

 

	solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to
	facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
	that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
	any acquisition proposal including approving any transaction, or
	any person becoming an interested stockholder, under the
	business combination with interested stockholder provision of
	Delaware law; or

 

	enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
	or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information
	with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt
	by any person with respect to or cooperate in any way with any
	acquisition proposal.

Packard BioScience also agreed to cease all discussions and
negotiations that commenced on or before the date the merger
agreement was signed regarding any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition
proposal. Packard BioScience also agreed to notify PerkinElmer
promptly and orally, with written confirmation to follow within
24 hours, of the occurrence of any acquisition proposal or
request for nonpublic information in connection with any
acquisition proposal by any person that Packard BioScience has
knowledge may be considering making or has made, including
specified information regarding the proposal. Packard BioScience
also agreed to keep PerkinElmer informed, on a prompt basis, of
the status of any such acquisition proposal or request.

An acquisition proposal is, other than the merger
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

 

	any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
	sale of substantial assets, tender offer, recapitalization,
	share exchange or other business combination involving Packard
	BioScience and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

 

	any proposal for the issuance by Packard BioScience or any of
	its subsidiaries of over 20% of its equity securities; or

 

	any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
	indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated
	total assets of Packard BioScience.

However, in response to an acquisition proposal that did not
result from a breach of the restrictions described above,
Packard BioScience may furnish information with respect to
Packard BioScience to any person or their representative making
an acquisition proposal, and engage in discussions or
negotiations with such person or their representative, pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement at least as materially
restrictive of the other party as the confidentiality agreement
between Packard BioScience and PerkinElmer, which need not
contain standstill provisions, that the board of directors of
Packard BioScience determines, in good faith and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal.
A superior proposal is any unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially
all of the equity securities or assets of Packard BioScience
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a
consolidation or sale of its assets that is:

 

	more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
	Packard BioScience common stock than the transactions
	contemplated by the merger agreement, taking into account all
	terms and conditions of the proposal and the merger agreement,
	including any PerkinElmer proposal to amend the agreement, as
	determined by the Packard BioScience board of directors in good
	faith and on the advice of a nationally recognized independent
	financial advisor; and

 

	reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed,
	taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal or other
	aspects of the proposal.

However, a proposal to acquire less than substantially all but
at least a majority of Packard BioSciences equity
securities may be a superior proposal as long as the other
provisions of the above definition are satisfied and the Packard
BioScience board of directors determines in its good faith
judgment, based on the advice of a nationally recognized
independent financial advisor, that the value of



the proposal, together with the fair market value of the Packard
BioScience common stock to be retained by Packard BioScience
stockholders, is more favorable from a financial point of view
to stockholders than the merger agreement.

In addition, Packard BioScience is not prohibited from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer or from making other disclosure to its stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Packard BioScience board
of directors, based on advice from outside legal counsel,
failure to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under law.

In addition, Packard BioScience has agreed that neither its
board of directors nor any committee thereof will, until the
effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, whichever first occurs:

 

	withdraw or propose to withdraw or knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner or propose to knowingly modify in any
	material adverse manner, the approval or recommendation of the
	merger agreement or the merger by the board of directors of
	Packard BioScience or any committee thereof;

 

	cause or permit Packard BioScience to enter into any letter of
	intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
	acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
	constituting or relating to an acquisition proposal, other than
	a permitted confidentiality agreement; or

 

	adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
	recommend, any acquisition proposal.

However, the board of directors of Packard BioScience or any
committee thereof may withdraw or knowingly modify in a material
adverse manner its approval or recommendation if it:

 

	determines, in good faith and after consultation with its
	outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that an
	acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal as to which
	it intends to enter into a binding written agreement;

 

	complies with the notice and other procedural requirements set
	forth in the merger agreement; and

 

	pays the termination fee upon its termination of the merger
	agreement described below under the caption
	 Termination; Expenses and Termination
	Fees.

In addition, the board of directors of Packard BioScience may
adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, a superior proposal if it complies with the notice
and other procedural requirements set forth in the merger
agreement and pays the termination fee upon its termination of
the merger agreement described below under the caption
Termination; Expenses and Termination Fees.

Stockholders Meetings. 
Each of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience has agreed to hold its special meeting of
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part is declared effective, and in any event within 45 days
of effectiveness:

 

	for Packard BioScience stockholders to consider and vote on the
	adoption of the merger agreement; and

 

	for PerkinElmer stockholders to consider and vote upon the
	issuance of the PerkinElmer common stock to Packard BioScience
	stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement.

Subject to the good faith determination by the PerkinElmer board
of directors that it is required to withdraw its recommendation
to comply with its fiduciary duties and to the ability of the
Packard BioScience board of directors to withdraw or knowingly
modify in a material adverse manner its recommendation of the
merger in connection with a superior proposal, each board is
obligated to recommend approval of the actions to be considered
by their respective stockholders. PerkinElmer, as the sole
stockholder of Pablo Acquisition Corp., is obligated to approve
the merger agreement.



Consents; Other Actions. 
PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience have also agreed to use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, directly or
indirectly, in connection with:

 

	obtaining any governmental consents, licenses, permits or
	waivers necessary to consummate the merger, making all necessary
	filings under any applicable domestic or foreign law, including
	the federal or state securities laws and executing any
	additional instruments necessary to consummate the merger;

 

	obtaining any governmental clearances or approvals required
	under federal, state or foreign antitrust laws in order to
	consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

	defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging
	the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions
	contemplated by the merger agreement; and

 

	obtaining specified third party consents that are required to
	consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

If required to obtain clearances or approvals of the merger
under federal, state or foreign antitrust laws, PerkinElmer has
agreed to divest assets of PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, or
of any of their subsidiaries, that generated $30 million or less
of the total consolidated sales of PerkinElmer and Packard
BioScience in fiscal year 2000.

Stock Exchange Listing. 
PerkinElmer has agreed to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
PerkinElmer common stock that will be issued in the merger to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Packard BioScience agreed
to use reasonable best efforts to continue the quotation of its
common stock on The Nasdaq National Market during the term of
the merger agreement.

Reorganization. 
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience have
each agreed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause
the merger to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience adopted the merger agreement
as a plan of reorganization.

Employee Matters. 
The surviving company in the merger has
agreed to honor all Packard BioScience employee plans, other
than its employee stock purchase plan, subject to any amendment
or termination permitted by such plans.

In addition, PerkinElmer has agreed to:

 

	provide compensation, including employee benefits, to Packard
	BioSciences U.S.  employees that is, in the
	aggregate, not materially less favorable than the compensation
	PerkinElmer provides to its similarly situated
	U.S. employees; and

 

	provide compensation, including employee benefits, to Packard
	BioSciences non-U.S. employees that is, in the
	aggregate, not materially less favorable than the compensation
	PerkinElmer provides to its similarly situated
	non-U.S. employees or the compensation that Packard
	BioScience provides them prior to the merger.

PerkinElmer has agreed that certain Packard BioScience
executives will have good reason to terminate
employment upon consummation of the merger and receive maximum
severance. See the section entitled The Merger 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger. Packard
BioSciences employee stock purchase plan will terminate
immediately prior to consummation of the merger, and
participants in the plan will then be entitled to exercise their
options for the final plan cycle to purchase shares of Packard
BioScience common stock.

Appointment to PerkinElmer Board of Directors. 
At the
effective time of the merger, PerkinElmer will appoint
Alexis P. Michas, as a designee of Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P., to the PerkinElmer board of
directors. See the section entitled Related

Director and Officer Indemnification. 
PerkinElmer has
agreed that, for a period of six years following the effective
time of the merger, PerkinElmer will indemnify the present and

extent that such obligation exists under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Packard BioScience as of the date of
the merger agreement. PerkinElmer has also agreed to cause
Packard BioScience, for six years after the merger, to maintain
in effect, with specified exceptions, a directors and
officers liability insurance policy covering those persons
who were covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance policy of Packard BioScience on
July 13, 2001, with coverage in amount and scope at least
as favorable to such persons as the current coverage provided by
Packard BioScience, provided that PerkinElmer will not be
required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by Packard BioScience for such coverage.

Notification. 
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience have
agreed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to give
reasonably prompt notice to one another of any event that would
be likely to result in a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in the merger agreement or the failure of any
covenant, condition or agreement in the merger agreement to be
complied with.

at any time prior to the effective time of the merger by mutual
written consent. In addition, either PerkinElmer or Packard
BioScience may terminate the merger agreement upon written
notice to the other party at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger under the following circumstances:

 

	if the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001, or
	February 15, 2002 in the event the consummation of the
	merger is delayed due to the need to obtain antitrust related
	governmental approvals and consents;

 

	if any governmental order, decree, ruling or action permanently
	restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger shall
	become final and non-appealable;

 

	if the Packard BioScience stockholders do not adopt the merger
	agreement at a meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders
	convened for that purpose; or

 

	if the PerkinElmer stockholders do not approve the issuance of
	the PerkinElmer common stock in connection with the merger at a
	meeting of PerkinElmer stockholders convened for that purpose.

In addition, Packard BioScience can terminate the merger
agreement upon written notice to PerkinElmer if:

 

	PerkinElmer or Pablo Acquisition Corp. breaches or fails to
	perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
	which breach or failure to perform would cause the closing
	conditions relating to the accuracy of PerkinElmers
	representations and warranties and performance of
	PerkinElmers covenants not to be satisfied and is not
	cured by PerkinElmer within 30 days of receiving written
	notice of the breach;

 

	the PerkinElmer board of directors or a committee of the board
	of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in a material
	adverse manner its recommendation that the PerkinElmer
	stockholders approve the issuance of PerkinElmer common stock in
	connection with the merger or fails to reconfirm its
	recommendation within five days (which may be extended by five
	additional days under certain circumstances) after Packard
	BioScience requests it to do so; or



 

	the Packard BioScience board of directors, or a committee
	thereof, before the meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders
	to consider the merger, provides written notice to PerkinElmer
	of its bona fide intention to enter in a binding written
	agreement for a superior proposal, provided that
	(1) Packard BioScience complied with its obligations not to
	solicit other acquisition proposals, as described under
	 Covenants of PerkinElmer and Packard
	BioScience  Packard BioScience is Restricted from
	Trying to Sell to Another Party, (2) Packard
	BioScience notifies PerkinElmer in writing of the superior
	proposal, including the material terms and conditions,

	favorable, as determined by the Packard BioScience board of
	directors in good faith and in consultation with its outside
	legal counsel and financial advisor, as the superior proposal
	within two business days of being notified of the superior
	proposal and (4) Packard BioScience pays the termination
	fee described below.

In addition, PerkinElmer can terminate the merger agreement upon
written notice if:

 

	Packard BioScience breaches or fails to perform any
	representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, which breach or
	failure to perform would cause the closing conditions relating
	to the accuracy of Packard BioSciences representations and
	warranties and performance of Packard BioSciences
	covenants not to be satisfied and is not cured by Packard
	BioScience within 30 days of receiving written notice of
	the breach;

 

	the Packard BioScience board of directors or a committee of the
	board of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in a material
	adverse manner its recommendation that the Packard BioScience

	five days under certain circumstances) after PerkinElmer
	requests it to do so; or

 

	a third party, other than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates,
	becomes the beneficial owner of at least a majority of the
	outstanding shares of Packard BioScience Common Stock.

If either PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience terminates the
merger agreement because of any of the reasons above, all
obligations of the parties under the merger agreement will
terminate, except some provisions, including the obligation to
pay fees and expenses incurred by either party in connection
with the merger and the requirements under a confidentiality
agreement. However, no termination shall relieve PerkinElmer or
Packard BioScience from liability or damages resulting from
willful breach of the merger agreement.

Expenses

Generally, PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will bear their
own expenses incurred in connection with the merger. However,
PerkinElmer and Packard BioScience will share equally the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with preparing, filing and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus, other than
accountants and attorneys fees, and the filing fee
of PerkinElmers pre-merger notification report.

Packard BioScience has agreed to pay up to $1,500,000 to
PerkinElmer as reimbursement for PerkinElmers fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the merger upon termination:

 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, because the merger is not
	completed by December 31, 2001, or February 15, 2002
	in the event the consummation of the merger is delayed due to
	the need to obtain antitrust related governmental approvals and
	consents, provided the meeting of the Packard BioScience
	stockholders convened for the purpose of adopting the merger
	agreement has not occurred and a third party has publicly
	announced an acquisition proposal with respect to Packard
	BioScience that remains outstanding at the time of termination;
	or

 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience, if the Packard BioScience
	stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at a meeting of
	Packard BioScience stockholders convened for that purpose.

However, if Packard BioScience has to pay a termination fee, as
described below, the termination fee can be reduced by any
amount of expenses that Packard BioScience previously reimbursed
PerkinElmer.



PerkinElmer has agreed to pay up to $1,500,000 to Packard
BioScience as reimbursement for Packard BioSciences fees
and expenses paid in connection with the merger upon termination

stockholders convened for that purpose.

Termination Fees

Packard BioScience must pay PerkinElmer a termination fee of
$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement:

 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience because the merger is not
	completed by December 31, 2001, or February 15, 2002
	in the event the consummation of the merger is delayed due to
	the need to obtain antitrust related governmental approvals and
	consents, provided the meeting of the Packard BioScience
	stockholders convened for the purpose of adopting the merger
	agreement has not occurred, if a third party has publicly
	announced an acquisition proposal to acquire Packard BioScience
	after the date of the merger agreement, but before the
	termination of the merger agreement, that remains outstanding
	and Packard BioScience enters into a definitive agreement with
	respect to an acquisition proposal, or an acquisition proposal
	relating to Packard BioScience is consummated with, a third
	party, other than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates, within
	12 months of the termination, provided that for the purpose
	of this determination only, all references to 20% in the
	definition of acquisition proposal are changed to 25%;

 

	by PerkinElmer because a third party, other than PerkinElmer or
	any of its affiliates, becomes the beneficial owner of at least
	a majority of the outstanding shares of Packard BioScience
	Common Stock;

 

	by PerkinElmer or Packard BioScience because the Packard
	BioScience stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at a
	meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders convened for that
	purpose, if a third party has publicly announced an acquisition
	proposal to acquire Packard BioScience after the date of the
	merger agreement, but before the termination of the merger
	agreement, that remains outstanding and Packard BioScience
	enters into a definitive agreement to be acquired by, or an
	acquisition proposal is consummated with, a third party, other
	than PerkinElmer or any of its affiliates, within 12 months
	of the termination, provided that for the purpose of this
	determination only, all references to 20% in the definition of
	acquisition proposal are changed to 25%;

 

	by PerkinElmer because of Packard BioSciences failure to
	satisfy the closing condition relating to the accuracy of its
	representations and warranties based on a breach of a
	representation or warranty that Packard BioScience knew was
	false when it was made, or because of Packard BioSciences
	failure to satisfy the closing condition relating to the
	performance of its covenants based on a material and knowing
	breach by Packard BioScience of its obligations in the merger
	agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to closing;

 

	by PerkinElmer because the Packard BioScience board of directors
	or committee of the board of directors withdraws or knowingly
	modifies in a material adverse manner its recommendation that
	the Packard BioScience stockholders adopt the merger agreement
	or fails to reconfirm its recommendation within five days (which
	may be extended by five days under certain circumstances) after
	PerkinElmer requests to do so; or

 

	by Packard BioScience because Packard BioScience, before the
	meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders to consider the
	merger, provides written notice to PerkinElmer of its bona fide
	intention to enter in a binding written agreement for a superior
	proposal, provided that (1) Packard BioScience complied
	with its obligations not to solicit other acquisition proposals,
	as described under  Covenants of PerkinElmer
	and Packard BioScience  Packard BioScience is
	Restricted from Trying to Sell to Another Party,

	the superior proposal, including the material terms and
	conditions, (3) PerkinElmer does not make an offer
	that is as favorable to the superior proposal within two
	business days of being notified of



	the superior proposal and (4) Packard BioScience
	concurrently with the termination pays the termination fee.

PerkinElmer must pay Packard BioScience a termination fee of
$23,500,000 upon termination of the merger agreement:

	merger or fails to reconfirm its recommendation within five days
	(which may be extended by five days under certain circumstances)
	after Packard BioScience requests to do so; or

 

	by Packard BioScience because of PerkinElmers failure to
	satisfy the closing condition relating to the accuracy of its
	representations and warranties based on a breach of a
	representation or warranty that PerkinElmer knew was false when
	it was made, or because of PerkinElmers failure to satisfy
	the closing condition relating to the performance of its

RELATED AGREEMENTS

Stockholder and Voting Agreements

As an inducement to PerkinElmer to enter into the merger
agreement, on July 13, 2001, Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. entered into a stockholders
agreement with PerkinElmer. As of
            ,
 2001, the record date for the special meeting of Packard
BioScience stockholders, Stonington owned 30,898,890 shares of
Packard BioScience common stock and had the right to direct the
vote with respect to an additional 1,123,590 shares of Packard
BioScience common stock. Together, these shares represented
     % of the outstanding Packard
BioScience common stock on the record date for the special
meeting of Packard BioScience stockholders. Pursuant to the
stockholders agreement, Stonington agreed to vote the
shares that it owns or acquires, and to direct the vote with
respect to the shares over which it has or acquires the power to
direct the vote, in favor of the merger agreement and against
opposing proposals. In addition, Stonington
irrevocably appointed PerkinElmer as its proxy to vote the
shares it owns. Accordingly, Stonington has agreed not to
transfer any of the shares that it owns and not to consent to
the transfer of the shares over which it has the power to direct
the vote. Stoningtons obligations to vote or direct the
vote and not to transfer or consent to the transfer of these
shares automatically terminate if the Packard BioScience board
of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in an adverse
manner its recommendation of the merger proposal, termination of
the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or
consummation of the merger agreement, whichever is earliest.

The stockholders agreement also provides Stonington with
the following additional rights:

 

	PerkinElmer has agreed to register for resale under the
	Securities Act of 1933 the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to
	be received by Stonington in the merger as promptly as
	practicable, but not later than 30  days, following the
	effective time of the merger. Stonington may also include these
	shares in other registration statements that PerkinElmer may
	file in the future, subject to specific exceptions. The
	registration rights will terminate if Stonington ceases to
	beneficially own at least 5% of the outstanding shares of
	PerkinElmer common stock or at such time as Stonington is able
	to sell the shares of PerkinElmer common stock it receives in
	the merger without any restrictions under Rule 145 under
	the Securities Act, whichever occurs first; and

 

	Stonington has the right to designate one person to be nominated
	as a director as of the effective time of the merger and at each
	annual meeting of stockholders of PerkinElmer following the
	effective time of the merger. Stoningtons initial designee
	to PerkinElmers board of directors upon the effectiveness
	of the merger is Alexis P. Michas. This right will terminate if
	Stonington ceases to beneficially own 5% or more of the
	outstanding shares of PerkinElmer common stock.

Stonington also agreed that, following the effective time of the
merger, it will not transfer more than 5% of the outstanding
shares of PerkinElmer common stock in any 90-day period, except
for sales in an underwritten offering permitted by the
stockholders agreement.

The stockholders agreement is attached as Annex D to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

As an inducement to PerkinElmer to enter into the merger
agreement, on July 13, 2001, Richard T. McKernan, Virginia
J. McKernan, Barbara P. Olcott, Emery G. Olcott, the
Timothy S. Olcott Trust, Timothy O. White, Jr. and Franklin R.
Witney each entered into separate voting agreements with
PerkinElmer. Pursuant to these agreements, these Packard
BioScience stockholders agreed to vote in favor of the merger
agreement and against opposing proposals and not to
transfer a total of 2,374,875 shares. However, a stockholder may
transfer some or all of his or her shares so long as, after
giving effect to the transfer, the number of shares subject to
these voting agreements and held by these Packard BioScience
stockholders is at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Packard BioScience common stock. The shares subject to
the voting agreements represented
     % of the outstanding shares of
Packard BioScience common stock on
            ,
 2001, the record date for the special meeting of Packard
BioScience stockholders. Each person also irrevocably appointed
PerkinElmer as his or her proxy, to vote his or her shares
accordingly. The obligations to vote and not to transfer their
shares and proxies automatically terminate if the Packard
BioScience board of directors withdraws or knowingly modifies in



an adverse manner its recommendation of the merger in response
to a superior proposal, termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms or consummation of the merger
agreement, whichever is earliest. The form of voting agreement
is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Employment Agreements

In connection with the merger, PerkinElmer and Franklin R.
Witney entered into a new employment agreement as described
under the section entitled The Merger 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.



UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial
information reflects PerkinElmers proposed acquisition of
Packard BioScience pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger
dated as of July 13, 2001. Packard BioScience is a global
developer, manufacturer and marketer of instruments and related
consumables and services for use in drug discovery and other
life sciences research, such as basic human disease research and
biotechnology. The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
financial information also reflects the annual results of
operations of NEN, which PerkinElmer acquired in fiscal year
2000, and GSLI, which Packard BioScience acquired in fiscal year
2000, for the year ended December 30, 2000.

In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, PerkinElmer will use the
purchase method of accounting for a business combination to
account for the merger as well as the new accounting and
reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles. Under
these methods of accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Packard BioScience, including all intangible assets, will be
recorded at their respective fair values. All intangible assets
will be amortized over their estimated useful lives with the
exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Packard BioScience will be included in
PerkinElmers financials prospectively as of the completion
of the merger.

The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information
gives effect to the acquisitions of Packard BioScience and NEN
as of the beginning of the periods presented and should be read
in conjunction with the historical financial statements and
related notes thereto for PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience and
NEN. The financial statements required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the NEN acquisition were
included as exhibits in a separate Report on Form 8-K,
filed by PerkinElmer on August 1, 2000. The unaudited pro
forma combined financial information for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 and the three-month period ended
April 1, 2001, as reclassified in PerkinElmers
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 3, 2001,
gives effect to the acquisitions as if they were completed as of
January 3, 2000, and combine PerkinElmer, Packard
BioScience and NENs historical statements of operations
for each respective period as necessary. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial information for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 excludes an acquisition-related charge of
$24.3 million for acquired in-process research and
development related to NEN. Additionally, this pro forma
financial information excludes an estimated acquisition-related
charge of $66.8 million for acquired in-process research
and development related to the proposed acquisition of Packard
BioScience. PerkinElmer has not yet finalized an appraisal of
the Packard BioScience in-process research and development and
accordingly, the final amount may differ from this estimate.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 includes columns
representing: (1) PerkinElmers historical results as
adjusted for the planned divestiture of its Security and
Detection Systems business for the twelve months then ended,
(2) NENs historical results for the period from
January 1 through July 31, 2000, the date of the NEN
acquisition by PerkinElmer, (3) GSI Lumonics, Inc.s
historical results for the period from January 1 through
September 30, 2000, the date of the GSLI acquisition by
Packard BioScience, and (4) Packard BioSciences
historical results for the fiscal twelve months ended
December 31, 2000.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the
three months ended April 1, 2001 includes columns
representing PerkinElmers historical results as adjusted
for the planned divestiture of its Security and Detection
Systems business for the three months then ended and the
incorporation of Packard BioSciences historical results
for the period from January 1, 2001 through March 31,
2001.

The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of
April 1, 2001 includes the historical balance sheet of
PerkinElmer as adjusted for the planned divestiture of its
Security and Detection Systems business as of April 1, 2001
and gives effect to the proposed acquisition of Packard
BioScience as if it occurred on April 1, 2001.



The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is
provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of PerkinElmers operating results that would
have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated on the
dates, or at the beginning of the period, for which the
consummation of the acquisitions is being given effect, nor is
it necessarily indicative of PerkinElmers future operating
results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments do not reflect any
operating efficiencies and cost savings that PerkinElmer
believes are achievable.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been
prepared using the purchase method of accounting, whereby the
total cost of the acquisitions has been allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values at the effective date of
each acquisition. For the Packard BioScience acquisition, such
allocations will be based on studies and independent valuations,
which are currently being conducted. Accordingly, the
allocations reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information are preliminary and subject to revision.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

Note 1  Presentation

On July 16, 2001, PerkinElmer announced its intention to
sell its Security and Detection Systems business. Accordingly,
the results of operations of the Security and Detection Systems
business have been excluded from PerkinElmers historical
results from continuing operations and it is reflected as net
assets from discontinued operations in the accompanying
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet.

Note 2  Purchase Price Allocation

The purchase price allocation related to the NEN acquisition is
included in PerkinElmers Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and its Current Report
filed on Form 8-K, filed August 1, 2000, related to
the NEN acquisition.

The aggregate purchase price to be paid for Packard BioScience
is estimated at $757 million, including acquisition costs, based
upon the average of the closing prices of PerkinElmer common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the five day period
ended July 17, 2001. In connection with this acquisition,
PerkinElmer agreed to issue 0.311 shares of PerkinElmer common
stock for each outstanding share of Packard BioScience common
stock. PerkinElmer also agreed to assume all outstanding options
to purchase Packard BioScience common stock, which options will
become exercisable for shares of PerkinElmer common stock
following the merger after giving effect to the same exchange
ratio as offered to the Packard BioScience common stockholders.
The purchase price for Packard BioScience has been allocated to
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. The preliminary purchase price allocation is based on
PerkinElmers current estimates of respective fair values.
Some allocations will be based on studies and independent
valuations that are currently being conducted. The components of
the estimated purchase price and preliminary allocation are as
follows (in thousands):

PerkinElmers current estimate of those costs.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION  (Continued)

Approximately $66.8 million was allocated to in-process research
and development for projects that are not expected to reach
technological feasibility as of the closing date of the
acquisition, and for which no alternative use exists. The
estimated fair value is based on risk-adjusted cash flows as
determined by an independent third party appraiser. The acquired
in-process research and development charge has not been included
in the pro forma combined statements of operations due to its
nonrecurring nature.

Note (A)

Adjustments relate to the write-up to fair value of the Packard
BioScience work-in-process and finished goods inventory as of
its deemed acquisition date which totaled $2.5 million. This
amount is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is
sold and has been included in cost of sales in the pro forma
combined statement of operations through a pro forma adjustment
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

Note (B)

The acquired identifiable intangible assets of Packard
BioScience and NEN include the fair value assigned to
trademarks, trade names, patents and developed technology by an
independent third party appraiser. These intangible assets are
being amortized over periods of 10-40 years for NEN and
7-15 years for Packard BioScience. The pro forma adjustments to
the combined statements of operations include amortization
expense related to the Packard BioScience identifiable
intangible assets of (1) $13.6 million relating to cost of
sales, and (2) $3.5 million relating to selling, general
and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 and (3) $3.4 million relating to
cost of sales and $880,000 relating to selling, general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended April 1,
2001, respectively. The pro forma adjustments to the combined
statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 includes incremental amortization expense
over the historical amounts related to the NEN identifiable
intangible assets of $642,000 for selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the
fair value of net assets acquired and totaled (1) $441
million with respect to the acquisition of Packard Bioscience,
(2) $271 million with respect to the acquisition of NEN,
and (3) $90 million with respect to GSLI, a company
acquired by Packard BioScience. The Packard BioScience goodwill
will not be amortized, as discussed below and is therefore not
reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the combined statements
of operations for either period presented. The pro forma
adjustments to the combined statement of operations for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 include incremental
amortization expense over historical amounts related to the NEN
and GSLI goodwill of $7.9 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the acquisitions of NEN and GSLI as purchases and
properly reflects the appropriate accounting methods for all
intangible assets under the accounting rules that were in
existence prior to June 30, 2001.

Effective June 30, 2001 the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,
Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and other
Intangible Assets. These statements require the use of the
purchase method of accounting and the allocation of the purchase
price to assets and liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values. They define the criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and
eliminate the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 are
effective for any business combination that is initiated after
June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro
forma combined statement of operations do not reflect any
amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite
lives that will result from PerkinElmers proposed
acquisition of Packard BioScience.



NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION  (Continued)

Note (C)

Adjustments relate to the write-up to fair value of Packard
BioScience and NEN property, plant and equipment as of their
respective deemed acquisition dates which totaled $4.0 million
and $3.0 million, respectively, and the resulting additional
depreciation expense. The pro forma adjustments to the combined
statements of operations include additional depreciation expense
related to the Packard BioScience write-up of: (1) $170,000
relating to cost of sales and $73,000 relating to selling,
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000 and (2) $43,000 relating to cost of
sales and $18,000 relating to selling, general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended April 1,
2001. The pro forma adjustments to the combined statement of
operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000
include incremental depreciation expense over the historical
amounts included in this statement of operations related to the
NEN write-up of $137,000 for cost of sales and $59,000 for
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note (D)

Reflects incremental interest expense related to financing the
acquisitions of NEN and GSLI.

PerkinElmer originally financed the NEN acquisition with
commercial paper borrowings and later refinanced it with
$410 million of zero coupon senior convertible debentures,
which were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%. In
connection with completing this debt offering, PerkinElmer
incurred issuance costs of $12 million, which are being
amortized to interest expense over three years.

Packard BioScience financed the acquisition of GSLI with
approximately $40 million of borrowings. Therefore,
$2.1 million of interest expense has been included as a pro
forma adjustment. A one-eighth of one percent change in the base
rate would change annual pro forma interest expense by
approximately $50,000.

Note (E)

Reflects adjustment to eliminate an unrealized loss related to a
warrant of $12.7 million from NENs historical
statement of operations for fiscal 2000. The unrealized loss is
a result of NENs early adoption of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As
of December 31, 2000, PerkinElmer had not yet adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 and therefore, this amount has
been eliminated through a pro forma adjustment. On
January 1, 2001, PerkinElmer adopted SFAS No. 133 and
determined the effect of this adoption did not have a material
effect on its results of operations or financial position due to
its relatively limited use of derivatives.

Note (F)

Reflects adjustments to eliminate the historical equity accounts
of Packard BioScience and issuance of common stock and options
in connection with the acquisition. Additionally, the in-process
research and development charge of $66.8 million is
reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. This amount will
be expensed as a non-recurring, non-tax deductible charge upon
the consummation of the acquisition. The acquired in-process
research and development charge has not been included in the pro
forma combined statement of operations due to its nonrecurring
nature.

Note (G)

Reflects adjustments to eliminate in-process research and
development charges related to PerkinElmers acquisition
of: (1) NEN -$24.3 million, (2) NENs
acquisition of Receptor Biology  $1.0 million and
(3) Packard BioSciences acquisition of GSLI
- -$12.1 million from the historical financial statements of
PerkinElmer, NEN and Packard BioScience for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000. Also reflects an adjustment to
eliminate non-recurring in-process research and development
charges related

Note (H)

Includes adjustments to accrue transaction costs, record the
deferred tax effect resulting from purchase accounting and

Note (J)

Income tax adjustments have been calculated using estimated
statutory income tax rates for the jurisdictions in which the
companies operate. The pro forma consolidated provision for
income taxes may not represent amounts that would have resulted
had PerkinElmer, Packard BioScience (including GSLI) and NEN
filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

General

The PerkinElmer charter and by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute and other Massachusetts laws related to
corporations currently govern the rights of the holders of
PerkinElmer common stock. The Packard BioScience charter and
by-laws, the Delaware corporation statute and other Delaware
laws related to corporations currently govern the rights of
Packard BioScience stockholders. As a result of the merger,
Packard BioScience stockholders will become holders of
PerkinElmers common stock and the rights of the former
Packard BioScience stockholders will thereafter be governed by
PerkinElmers charter and by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute and other Massachusetts laws related to
corporations.

The following summary sets forth certain differences between the
Massachusetts corporation statute and the Delaware corporation
statute, between the PerkinElmer charter and the Packard
BioScience charter and between the PerkinElmer by-laws and the
Packard BioScience by-laws. Packard BioScience stockholders are
encouraged to review the full text of each of the PerkinElmer
charter, the PerkinElmer by-laws, the Packard BioScience
charter, the Packard BioScience by-laws, the Massachusetts
corporation statute, the Delaware corporation statute and other
corporation-related laws of Massachusetts and Delaware to the
extent they relate to corporations organized in such states. The
PerkinElmer charter and the PerkinElmer by-laws have been filed
as exhibits to the material filed by PerkinElmer with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. For information as to how
documents may be obtained, see Where You Can Find More
Information.

Capitalization

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmer is authorized to issue
300,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 70,000 shares have been designated
Series C junior participating preferred stock. On
            ,
 2001,
          shares
 of PerkinElmer common stock were issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
PerkinElmers board has the authority, without stockholder
approval, to issue shares of authorized but undesignated
preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to
fix the rights, preferences and other terms, including voting
rights, of each series of preferred stock, which rights,
preferences and other terms may be superior to that of the
PerkinElmer common stock.

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioScience is authorized to
issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. On
            ,
 2001,
               shares
 of Packard BioScience common stock were issued and outstanding
and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
Packard BioSciences board has the authority, without
stockholder approval, to issue shares of authorized preferred
stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the
rights and preferences, including voting rights, of each series
of preferred stock, which rights, preferences and other terms
may be superior to that of the Packard BioScience common stock.

Classes of Stock

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmers common stock is currently
its only outstanding class of stock, each share of which
participates equally in dividends and distributions upon
dissolution of the corporation. Under Massachusetts law and the
PerkinElmer charter, PerkinElmers directors may determine
the preferences, voting powers, qualifications, and special or
relative rights or privileges of any class of stock before the
issuance of any share of that class. For a more complete
description of PerkinElmers capital stock, please see the
section entitled Description of PerkinElmer Capital
Stock.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law also allows the
directors of a Delaware corporation to determine the voting
powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of a class of stock if the
certificate of corporation so provides. The Packard BioScience
charter permits the board of directors to make such a
designation for preferred stock. This preferred stock may have
dividend and distribution rights superior to those of the
Packard BioScience common stock.



Dividends and Repurchases

PerkinElmer.
 Except with regard to a distribution of
stock of the corporation, Massachusetts law provides that the
directors of a corporation voting in favor of a distribution to
stockholders will be jointly and severally liable if the
distribution (1) is made when the corporation is insolvent,
(2) renders the corporation insolvent or (3) violates
the corporations charter. Stockholders to whom a
corporation makes any distribution, except a distribution of
stock of the corporation, may be liable to the corporation for
all or part of such distribution if such distribution is made
while the corporation is insolvent or renders the corporation
insolvent.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that the
directors of a corporation will be jointly and severally liable,
to the full amount unlawfully paid with interest, to the
corporation and its creditors in the event of a dissolution or
insolvency if they willfully or negligently pay a dividend that
is not out of the corporations surplus or net profits in
the fiscal year the dividend is paid or purchase or redeem stock
so that the corporations capital is impaired, other than
in certain repurchases or redemptions of stock that have
preferences over another class or series of stock.

Voting Requirements and Quorums for Stockholders Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 Each holder of PerkinElmer common stock is
entitled to one vote for each share and may not cumulate votes
for the election of directors. Each holder of PerkinElmer
Series C junior participating preferred stock is entitled
to 1,000 votes for each share on all matters voted on by the
holders of PerkinElmer common stock. The PerkinElmer by-laws
provide, in accordance with Massachusetts law, that the holders
of a majority of each class of the shares of the corporation
then issued, outstanding and entitled to vote constitute a
quorum, and that when a quorum is present any matter properly
brought before a stockholders meeting generally requires, and
may be effected by, a majority stockholder vote. However, any
election of directors by stockholders requires a plurality of
votes and any proposal to merge or consolidate with another
corporation requires a two-thirds vote.

Packard BioScience.
 Each holder of Packard BioScience
common stock is entitled to one vote for each share and may not
cumulate votes for the election of directors. The Packard
BioScience charter and by-laws provide, in accordance with
Delaware law, that the holders of a majority of the shares of
the corporation then issued, outstanding and entitled to vote
constitute a quorum, and that, when a quorum is present, a
majority vote is required to effect any matter, except as
provided in the section below entitled
 Approval of Business Combinations and Asset
Sales and except that any election of directors by
stockholders requires a plurality vote.

Cumulative Voting

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law does not authorize or
provide for cumulative voting rights by stockholders in the
election of directors (i.e., each stockholder casts as many
votes for all or any of the directors as he has shares of stock
multiplied by the number of directors to be elected). Neither
the PerkinElmer charter nor the PerkinElmer by-laws provide for
cumulative voting.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, a corporation may
provide in its charter for cumulative voting. Neither the
Packard BioScience charter nor the Packard BioScience by-laws
provide for cumulative voting.

Annual Meeting of Stockholders

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law, the notice of a
corporations annual meeting must state the purpose of the
meeting. The PerkinElmer by-laws allow the board of directors or
the chairman of the board to determine the matters to be
addressed at the annual meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 Although Delaware law does not
require the purpose of the annual meeting to be included in the
notice of the annual meeting, the Packard BioScience by-laws
require the purpose of



the annual meeting to be stated in the notice. Delaware law
provides that directors shall be elected at the annual meeting
and any other proper business may be transacted.

Special Meetings of Stockholders

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called by the president, by the PerkinElmer
board or upon written application of stockholders who hold at
least 40% of the capital stock of PerkinElmer entitled to vote
at the proposed meeting. Upon the written application of
stockholders who hold at least 40% of the capital stock of
PerkinElmer entitled to vote, a special meeting must be called
by PerkinElmers clerk.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law allows special meetings
of a corporations stockholders to be called by its board
of directors or by any person so authorized in the
corporations charter or by-laws. Delaware law provides
that the purpose of the special meeting must be included in the
notice of the special meeting. The Packard BioScience by-laws
provide that a special meeting of the stockholders may be called
only by the chairman of the board or by the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total
number of directors.

Notice of Stockholder Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide that notice of stockholder meetings
be given at least seven days before the meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 The Packard BioScience by-laws
require that nominations of persons for election to the board of
directors and the proposal of business to be considered at an
annual meeting of stockholders must be made:

 

	pursuant to the notice of meeting;

 

	by or at the direction of the board of directors; or

 

	by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of
	notice and complies with the notice procedures summarized in the
	next paragraph.

For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
a stockholders meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must
have given timely notice in writing to the secretary of Packard
BioScience and such other business must otherwise be a proper
matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a
stockholders notice must be delivered to the secretary at
the principal executive offices of Packard BioScience not later
than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the
close of business on the 120th day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting. If the
date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or
more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice must
be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th
day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of
business or the later of the 90th day prior to the annual
meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.

Advance Notice Provisions for Board Nomination and Other
Stockholders Business  Special Meetings

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmers by-laws do not contain
any advance notice provisions for board nomination or other
stockholder business at a special meeting.

Packard BioScience.
 Stockholder notice must be delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
a special meeting of stockholders and not later than the close
of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special
meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting
and the proposed nominees to the board of directors.



Action by Written Consent in Lieu of a Stockholders
Meeting

PerkinElmer.
 PerkinElmers by-laws provide that any
action by stockholders may be taken without a meeting and by
written consent if all the stockholders entitled to vote on the
matter consent. Under Massachusetts law, any action to be taken
by stockholders may be taken without a meeting only by unanimous
written consent and a corporation may not provide otherwise in
its articles of organization or by-laws. Accordingly, action by
written consent of the stockholders of PerkinElmer is
effectively prohibited.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, stockholders may
take action by written consent in lieu of voting at a
stockholders meeting unless prohibited by the certificate of
incorporation. Packard BioSciences certificate of
incorporation does not prohibit action by written consent. In
addition, Packard BioSciences by-laws provide that any
action by stockholders may be taken without a meeting and by
written consent. Therefore, stockholders of Packard BioScience
may act by written consent.

Classification of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law requires that, unless a
publicly traded corporation chooses otherwise, its board of
directors will be divided into classes, and that the term of
directors on a classified board cannot exceed five years.
PerkinElmer has chosen in its by-laws to have only one class of
directors, with each director to serve until the first annual
meeting following the annual meeting at which the director was
elected. However, Massachusetts law permits PerkinElmers
board to opt in to this provision to have a classified board at
any time.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law permits, but does not
require, a board of directors to be divided into classes with
each class having a term of office longer than one year. The
Packard BioScience by-laws provide for one class of directors,
with each director to serve one year, until his or her successor
has been elected and qualified.

Inspection Rights

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law, a
corporations stockholders are entitled to inspect and copy
its charter, by-laws, records of stockholders meetings, and
stock and transfer records. These documents must be kept either
at the corporations principal office, the transfer
agents office, or at the office of the corporations
clerk or resident agent. If access to these documents is
refused, the corporation will be liable to the requesting
stockholder for any actual damages which result from such
refusal. However, the corporation is not obligated to produce
such documents if the inspection is being sought to secure a
list of stockholders or other information to be sold or used for
a purpose unrelated to such persons interest as a
stockholder.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law entitles any stockholder
of record of a corporation, in person or by an agent, upon
written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, to
inspect during usual business hours, for any proper purpose, the
corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and
its other books and records, and to make copies or extracts
therefrom. A proper purpose means a purpose reasonably related
to such persons interest as a stockholder.

Removal of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 The PerkinElmer by-laws provide that any
director may be removed, with or without cause, by a two-thirds
stockholder vote, except that directors of a class elected by a
particular class of stockholders may be removed only a by
two-thirds vote of such stockholders. In addition, the
PerkinElmer by-laws also permit the removal of a director with
cause by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office.
The PerkinElmer by-laws also provide that a director may be
removed for cause by the directors or the stockholders only
after providing the director with reasonable notice and an
opportunity to be heard by the body proposing such removal.



Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that a director
serving on a board that is not classified may be removed with or
without cause by a majority of the shares entitled to vote.
Packard BioSciences by-laws provide that directors may be
removed only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the
holders at least 80% of the combined voting power of the
outstanding shares of Packard BioSciences voting stock,
voting as a single class.

Change in Number of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law provides that the number
of directors shall be set in a corporations by-laws, but
shall not be less than three. In accordance with Massachusetts
law, the PerkinElmer by-laws allow the stockholders or a
majority of the directors to increase the number of directors to
a number greater than three but in no event more than 13.
PerkinElmer currently has nine directors.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that the number
of directors may be fixed in a corporations by-laws unless
it is fixed in the corporations charter, in which case a
change in the number of directors shall be made only by
amendment to the corporations charter. Packard
BioSciences by-laws fix the number of directors of at
least three but no more than 12. Packard BioScience currently
has eight directors.

Indemnification and Limitation of Liability

PerkinElmer.
 In accordance with Massachusetts law, the
PerkinElmer by-laws provide for indemnification of
PerkinElmers officers and directors for expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with claims, liabilities and
expenses to which such officer or director may be or become
subject by reason of his or her being or having been an officer
or a director of the corporation or by reason of his or her
alleged acts or omissions as an officer or director of the
corporation, except that no indemnification shall be provided
for any person if he or she has been adjudicated not to have
acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that his or her
action was in the best interests of the corporation or if
indemnification under the circumstances is deemed to be against
public policy. Massachusetts law contains provisions similar to
those Delaware law provisions described below which allow for
advancement of expenses, the purchase of indemnity insurance,
and the elimination or limitation of liability.
PerkinElmers charter eliminates the personal liability of
directors to PerkinElmer or to stockholders for monetary damages
for beach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by
Massachusetts law.

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioSciences charter
eliminates the personal liability of directors to Packard
BioScience or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty to the full extent permitted by Delaware law,
except for a breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions
not taken in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, unlawful payments of dividends or
stock repurchases or transactions from which a director derived
an improper personal benefit. Packard BioSciences charter
and by-laws further provide that Packard BioScience may
indemnify its officers and directors to the full extent
permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law authorizes a corporation
to indemnify directors, officers, employees and agents of the
corporation if the party acted in good faith in a manner he
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the
corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful. Delaware law further provides that indemnification
shall be provided if the party in question is successful on the
merits or otherwise. Delaware law and Packard BioSciences
by-laws also provide for the advancement of attorneys fees and
other expenses, provided the director or officer provides the
corporation an undertaking to repay these advanced expenses if
it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be
indemnified by the corporation. In addition, Delaware law
provides for the elimination or limitation of personal liability
of directors for monetary damages resulting from a breach of
fiduciary duties except in certain situations, including any
breach of the duty of loyalty. Delaware law also provides that a
corporation may obtain directors and officers
insurance to provide coverage to officers, directors, employees
and agents.



The Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its
position that the indemnification of directors, officers and
controlling persons against liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Interested Director Transaction

PerkinElmer.
 The PerkinElmer by-laws provide that, absent
fraud, no contract or other transaction between PerkinElmer and
any other entity or person will be affected or invalidated by
the fact that a director or officer of PerkinElmer is directly
or indirectly pecuniarily or otherwise interested in or
connected to, or is a party to, the contract or transaction, as
long as the directors or officers interest in or
connection to the transaction or contract is disclosed to and
known by the PerkinElmer board at the time it approves the
transaction or contract. Any such transaction or contract must
be approved by a majority of directors of PerkinElmer who are
not interested in or connected to the contract or transaction.
Massachusetts law provides that directors who vote for and
officers who knowingly participate in loans to officers or
directors are jointly and severally liable to the corporation
for any part of the loan which is not repaid, unless a majority
of the directors who are not direct or indirect recipients of
such loans or a majority of the stockholders have approved or
ratified the loan as one which in their judgment may reasonably
be expected to benefit the corporation.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that no
transaction between a corporation and a director or officer or
any entity in which any of them have an interest is void or
voidable solely for this reason or solely because the director
or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the
board or committee which authorized the contract or transaction.
A transaction is also not void or voidable solely because a
directors votes are counted for such purpose if
(1) after full disclosure the transaction is approved by
the disinterested directors or by the stockholders or
(2) the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time
it is approved.

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law and the PerkinElmer
by-laws provide that, unless otherwise filled by the
stockholders, any vacancy in the board of directors including a
vacancy resulting from enlargement of the board be filled by the
directors.

Packard BioScience.
 Delaware law provides that vacancies
and newly created directorships may be filled by a majority of
directors then in office, unless the charter or by-laws provide
otherwise. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or newly
created directorship, the directors then in office constitute
less than a majority of the entire board as constituted
immediately prior to any increase, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of shares
at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such
directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any
such vacancies or newly created directorships or to replace the
directors chosen by the directors at any time to fill a vacancy
not filled by the directors. Packard BioSciences by-laws
provide that any vacancy on the Packard BioScience board shall
be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even though less than a
quorum of the board of directors. Any director elected in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the
remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which
the vacancy occurred and until the directors successor
shall be elected and qualified.

Approval of Business Combinations and Asset Sales

PerkinElmer.
 Under Massachusetts law and the PerkinElmer
charter and by-laws, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
shares of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote,
or which would be adversely affected by a merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a
corporation, is generally necessary to approve any of these
types of transactions.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of stock outstanding and
entitled to vote is necessary to approve a merger or certain
asset sales. In addition,



Delaware law permits a company to merge with a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary without stockholder approval
under certain circumstances so as to cause the corporation to
become a holding company.

Anti-Takeover Legislation

PerkinElmer.
 Massachusetts law contains a three-year
moratorium on business combinations between a corporation and
interested stockholders, unless certain conditions are met. In
addition, the Massachusetts control share acquisition statute
restricts the voting rights of shares acquired under specified
circumstances. PerkinElmer has elected to opt out of the control
share acquisitions provision of the Massachusetts corporate
statute. PerkinElmer could, however, opt into these control
share acquisitions provisions at any time by amending its
by-laws. For a more complete description of the Massachusetts
control share acquisition provisions, please see the sections
entitled Description of PerkinElmer Capital
Stock  Certain Provisions of PerkinElmers
By-laws and Massachusetts law  Business Combinations
with Interested Stockholders and  Control
Share Acquisitions.

Packard BioScience.
 Under Delaware law, business
combinations by corporation with interested
stockholders are subject to a moratorium of three years,
unless specified conditions are met. The prohibited transactions
include a merger with, disposition of assets to, or the issuance
of stock to, the interested stockholder, or certain transactions
that have the effect of increasing the proportionate share of
the outstanding securities held by the interested stockholder.

Under Delaware law, an interested stockholder may avoid the
prohibition against effecting certain significant transactions
with the corporation if the board of directors, prior to the
time such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder,
approves such transaction or the transaction by which such
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder or if at or
subsequent to such time the board of directors and the
stockholders approve such transaction. These provisions of
Delaware law apply to a Delaware corporation unless the
corporation opts out of the provisions in its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Packard BioScience has
not opted out of these provisions in its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws and consequently is subject to these
provisions.

Stockholder Rights Agreement

PerkinElmer.
 Under its stockholder rights agreement, each
outstanding share of PerkinElmer common stock has attached to it
a stock purchase right. These stock purchase rights trade with
the PerkinElmer common stock and are not currently exercisable.
The stock purchase rights generally become exercisable upon the
earlier to occur of:

 

	ten days following a public announcement by PerkinElmer that a
	person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more

	ten business days after the beginning of a tender offer or
	exchange offer that would result in a person or group
	beneficially owning 30% or more of the outstanding PerkinElmer
	common stock.

The stock purchase rights are exercisable for shares of
PerkinElmer common stock or series C junior participating
preferred stock depending upon the circumstances under which the
stock purchase rights are exercised. In some cases, the exercise
price of the stock purchase rights may be significantly below
the market value of PerkinElmers common stock.

PerkinElmer may redeem the stock purchase rights at a price of
$.01 per right at any time until ten days after the date on
which a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding PerkinElmer common stock. The stock
purchase rights will expire on the close of business on
February 8, 2005. See the section entitled
Description of PerkinElmer Capital Stock 
Stockholder Rights Plan.

Packard BioScience.
 Packard BioScience does not have a
stockholder rights plan.

entitled to dissenters rights in connection with any
merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of a
corporations assets and in connection with the adoption of
charter amendments that may adversely affect the rights or
preferences of stockholders.

Packard BioScience.

DESCRIPTION OF PERKINELMER CAPITAL STOCK

The following description of PerkinElmers common stock and
preferred stock summarizes the material terms and provisions of
these types of securities. For the complete terms of
PerkinElmers common stock and preferred stock, please
refer to PerkinElmers charter, by-laws and stockholder
rights plan, which have been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The terms of these securities may also be
affected by Massachusetts law.

Under the PerkinElmer charter, PerkinElmers authorized
capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock,
$1.00 par value per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $1.00 par value per share.

Common Stock

As of
            ,
 2001, PerkinElmer had
          shares
 of common stock issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share
of common stock currently has attached to it one-half of one
preferred share purchase right issued under the PerkinElmer
stockholder rights plan, which is summarized below. All
outstanding shares of common stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Voting

For all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, each holder
of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share
registered in his or her name on the books of PerkinElmer.
PerkinElmer common stock does not have cumulative voting rights.
As a result, subject to the voting rights of any outstanding
preferred stock, of which there currently is none, persons who
hold more than 50% of the outstanding common stock entitled to
elect members of the PerkinElmer board of directors can elect
all of the directors who are up for election in a particular
year.

Dividends

If the PerkinElmer board of directors declares a dividend,
holders of the PerkinElmer common stock will receive payments
from the funds of PerkinElmer that are legally available to pay
dividends. However, this dividend right is subject to any
preferential dividend rights PerkinElmer may grant to holders of
preferred stock, if any is outstanding.

Liquidation

If PerkinElmer is dissolved, the holders of common stock will be
entitled to share ratably in all the assets that remain after
payment of PerkinElmer liabilities and any amounts owed to the
persons who hold preferred stock, if any is outstanding.

Other Rights And Restrictions

Holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights, and they
have no right to convert their common stock into any other
securities. PerkinElmer common stock is not subject to
redemption by PerkinElmer. PerkinElmers charter and
by-laws do not restrict the ability of a holder of common stock
to transfer his, her or its shares of common stock.

When PerkinElmer issues shares of common stock, the shares will
be fully paid and non-assessable. Massachusetts law provides
that, if PerkinElmer makes a distribution to its stockholders
other than a distribution of PerkinElmer capital stock, when it
is insolvent, or that renders it insolvent, then PerkinElmer
stockholders would be required to pay back to PerkinElmer the
amount of the distribution made to them, or the portion of the
distribution that causes PerkinElmer to become insolvent.

Listing

PerkinElmer common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.



Transfer Agent And Registrar

The transfer agent and registrar for PerkinElmer common stock is
Mellon Investor Services LLC.

Preferred Stock

As of
            ,
 2001, PerkinElmer had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
PerkinElmers charter authorizes the PerkinElmer board of
directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to
determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates,
liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights,
including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and
other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock.

As of
            ,
 2001, PerkinElmer board of directors had designated 70,000
shares of preferred stock as Series C Junior
Participating Preferred Stock in connection with
PerkinElmer stockholder rights plan. The rights, preferences and
privileges of the series C preferred stock are described below.

Series C Preferred Stock

The PerkinElmer board has reserved the series C preferred
stock for issuance in connection with PerkinElmer stockholder
rights plan, which is described below. As of July 13, 2001,
there were no shares of series C preferred stock
outstanding. The following description is a summary of all the
material terms of PerkinElmer series C preferred stock. It
does not restate these terms in their entirety. PerkinElmer
urges you to read its charter because it, and not this
description, defines the rights of holders of series C
preferred stock.

Voting.
 Each share of series C preferred stock is
entitled to 1,000 votes, subject to adjustment. Except as
provided below, each share of series C preferred stock
votes together with the holders of common stock and all other
capital stock of PerkinElmer on all matters voted on by
stockholders.

In the event that PerkinElmer fails to pay six quarterly
dividends on the series C preferred stock, the holders of
the series C preferred stock, voting as a single class, will
have the right to elect two members of the PerkinElmer board of
directors. Any director elected by the holders of series C
preferred stock may be removed with or without cause by such
holders. The terms of all directors elected under this provision
will terminate when the dividend arrearage is fully paid and, in
addition, PerkinElmer has paid at least one regular dividend
after the curing of the arrearage.

Without the vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of series C preferred stock, PerkinElmer may not alter or
repeal any provisions in PerkinElmers charter so as to
adversely affect the rights of the series C preferred stock.

Dividends.
 With respect to the payment of dividends and
the distribution of assets, the series C preferred stock
ranks junior to all series of all other series of preferred
stock, unless the terms of a particular series provide
otherwise. The holders of shares of series C preferred stock are
entitled to cash dividends equal to the greater of
(a) $1.00 or (b) 1,000 times the per share amount of
all cash dividends and 1,000 times the per share amount of all
non-cash dividends, other than dividends payable in common stock
or by a subdivision of the outstanding common stock, which have
been declared on the common stock since the preceding quarterly
dividend payment date. Dividends on the series C preferred
stock are payable quarterly on the first day of March, June,
September and December each year.

The PerkinElmer board of directors must declare a dividend on
the series C preferred stock after it declares any dividend on
the common stock, other than dividends payable in common stock.
However, if the PerkinElmer board of directors does not declare
a dividend on the common stock during the period between
quarterly dividend payment dates, a dividend of $1.00 per share
of series C preferred stock will still be payable on the
following quarterly dividend payment date. Dividends begin to
accrue and accumulate on outstanding shares of series C
preferred stock from the quarterly dividend payment date
preceding the date of issuance of such shares.



Liquidation.
 If PerkinElmer liquidates, dissolves or
winds up, then it:

 

	must pay the holders of outstanding shares of series C
	preferred stock, before it makes any payment to the holders of
	shares of stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock, an amount equal to $1,000 per share, plus all unpaid
	accrued dividends or, if greater, an amount equal to 1,000 times
	the amount to be paid to holders of common stock; and

 

	may not make any distribution to the holders of shares of stock
	ranking on a parity with the series C preferred stock,
	except for distributions made ratably to the holders of
	series C preferred stock and other classes or series of
	preferred stock.

For purposes of this liquidation preference, neither the
consolidation, merger or other business combination of
PerkinElmer with another entity nor the sale of all or any of
PerkinElmer property, assets or business will be treated as a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of PerkinElmer.

Merger, Consolidation or Similar Transaction.
 If
PerkinElmer is a party to any merger, consolidation or similar
transaction in which shares of common stock are exchanged or
changed into stock or securities of another entity, cash or
property of another entity, then the series C preferred stock
will be exchanged or changed into an amount per share equal to
1,000 times the amount of consideration into which or for which
each share of common stock is changed or exchanged in such
merger, consolidation or similar transaction.

Adjustments For Stock Splits And Other Events.
 In the
event that PerkinElmer declares a dividend on its common stock
that is payable in common stock or it effects a subdivision,
combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of its
common stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, then the
dividend, liquidation and merger or consolidation amounts
payable to holders of series C preferred stock will be
increased or reduced in proportion to the resulting increase or
decrease in the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding.

Certain Restrictions.
 If any quarterly dividends payable
on the series C preferred stock are in arrears, then, until
all of these unpaid dividends have been paid in full,
PerkinElmer may not:

 

	declare or pay dividends on any shares of stock ranking junior
	to the series C preferred stock;

 

	declare or pay any dividends on any shares of stock ranking on a
	parity with the series C preferred stock, except ratably
	among all of these parity stocks;

 

	redeem any stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock, unless it redeems the junior stock by issuing additional
	shares of stock ranking junior to the series C preferred
	stock; or

 

	redeem any shares of series C preferred stock or shares of
	stock ranking on a parity with the shares of series C
	preferred stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer to
	all holders of these series or classes upon terms that the
	PerkinElmer board of directors deems fair and equitable.

PerkinElmer may not permit any of its subsidiaries to purchase
any shares of PerkinElmer stock, unless it is able at such time
to purchase shares in accordance with the terms described in the
preceding paragraph.

Redemption.
 PerkinElmer cannot redeem the series C
preferred stock.

Fractional Shares.
 PerkinElmer may issue the
series C preferred stock in fractions of a single share,
but each fraction must be a multiple of one one-thousandth of a
share. Each fractional share of series C preferred stock
will have proportionate voting, dividend, liquidation and other
rights as discussed above.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On January 25, 1995, the PerkinElmer board of directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan. This stockholder rights plan
was amended and restated on January 30, 2001. Under this
stockholder rights plan, each PerkinElmer common stockholder
received a dividend of one preferred stock purchase
right for each outstanding share of common stock that the
stockholder owned. PerkinElmer refers to these preferred



stock purchase rights as the Rights. As a result of
the two-for-one stock split effected by PerkinElmer on
June 4, 2001, pursuant to the terms of the stockholder
rights plan, the number of Rights distributed per share of
PerkinElmer common stock has been proportionately adjusted to
one-half a Right per share. The Rights trade automatically with
shares of PerkinElmer common stock and become exercisable only
under certain circumstances described below.

The purpose of the Rights is to encourage potential acquirers to
negotiate with the PerkinElmer board of directors before
attempting a takeover bid and to provide the PerkinElmer board
of directors with leverage in negotiating on behalf of the
PerkinElmer stockholders the terms of any proposed takeover. The
Rights may have certain antitakeover effects. They should not,
however, interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the PerkinElmer board of directors.

The following description is a summary of all the material terms
of the PerkinElmer stockholder rights plan. It does not restate
these terms in their entirety. For the complete terms of
PerkinElmers stockholder rights plan, please refer to
PerkinElmers stockholder rights plan filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy at no
charge by writing to us at the address listed under the caption
Where You Can Find More Information.

Exercise Of Rights.
 Until a Right is exercised, the
holder of a Right will not have any rights as a stockholder.
When the Rights become exercisable, holders of the Rights will
be able to purchase from PerkinElmer a unit equal to 1/1000th of
a share of PerkinElmer series C preferred stock, at a purchase
price of $60 per unit.

In general, the rights will become exercisable upon the earlier
of:

 

	ten days following a public announcement by PerkinElmer that a
	person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more
	of the outstanding shares of common stock; or

 

	ten business days after the beginning of a tender offer or
	exchange offer that would result in a person or group
	beneficially owning 30% or more of the PerkinElmer common stock.

Flip In Event.
 If a person or group becomes the
beneficial owner of 20% or more of PerkinElmer common stock,
then each Right will then entitle its holder to receive, upon
exercise, a number of shares of PerkinElmer common stock which
is equal to (a) the exercise price of the right divided by
(b) one-half of the market price of PerkinElmer common
stock on the date of the occurrence of this event. This
occurrence is known as a flip in event. A flip in
event does not occur if there is an offer for all of PerkinElmer
outstanding shares of common stock that the PerkinElmer board of
directors determines is fair to its stockholders and in
PerkinElmers best interests.

Flip Over Event. 
If at any time after a person or group
becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of
PerkinElmers common stock, (a) PerkinElmer is
acquired in a merger or other transaction in which PerkinElmer
does not survive or in which the PerkinElmer common stock is
changed or exchanged or (b) 50% or more of PerkinElmers
assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then each holder
of a Right will be entitled to receive, upon exercise, a number
of shares of common stock of the acquiring company in the
transaction equal to (1) the exercise price of the Right
divided by (2) one-half of the market price of the
acquiring companys common stock on the date of the
occurrence of this event. This exercise right will not occur if
the merger or other transaction follows an offer for all of
PerkinElmers outstanding shares of common stock that the
PerkinElmer board of directors determines is fair to PerkinElmer
stockholders and in PerkinElmers best interests.

Exchange Of Rights. 
At any time after a flip in event,
the PerkinElmer board of directors may exchange the Rights by
providing to the holder one share of PerkinElmer common stock or
one one-thousandth of a share of PerkinElmer series C
preferred stock for each of the holders Rights.

Redemption Of Rights.
 At any time until ten days after
the date on which a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
PerkinElmer common stock, PerkinElmer may redeem the Rights at a
price of $.01 per Right. The Rights will expire on the close of



business on February 8, 2005, subject to earlier expiration
or termination as described in the PerkinElmer stockholder
rights plan.

Certain Provisions Of PerkinElmers By-laws And
Massachusetts Law

PerkinElmers by-laws.
 PerkinElmers by-laws
impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of
stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders. For
example, requests for stockholder meetings may be made only
during limited periods of time and must be made by a group of
stockholders holding at least 40%, or, if less, the maximum
percentage permitted by law, of the outstanding capital stock
entitled to vote at the meeting.

Business Combinations With Interested Stockholders.

Massachusetts law contain antitakeover provisions regarding,
among other things, business combinations with an affiliated
stockholder. In general, Massachusetts law prevents a publicly
held Massachusetts corporation from engaging in a business
combination as defined in the Massachusetts corporation
statute with an interested stockholder for a period
of three years after the date of the transaction in which the
person became an interested stockholder, unless:

 

	before the date on which the person became an interested
	stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved
	either the business combination or the transaction in which the
	person became an interested stockholder;

 

	the interested stockholder acquires 90% of the outstanding
	voting stock of the corporation at the time it becomes an
	interested stockholder; or

 

	the business combination is approved by the board of directors
	and the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of
	the corporation voting at a meeting, excluding the voting stock
	owned by the interested stockholder.

An interested stockholder is generally a person
owning more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation. A business combination includes mergers,
consolidations, stock and assets sales and other transactions
with the interested stockholder which result in a financial
benefit to the interested stockholder.

Control Share Acquisitions

PerkinElmer has elected to opt out of the control share
acquisitions provision of the Massachusetts corporation statute.
PerkinElmer could, however, opt into these control share
acquisitions provisions at any time by amending its by-laws.

In general, the control share acquisitions provision of the
Massachusetts corporation statute provides that any person,
including his, her or its affiliates, who acquires shares of a
corporation that is subject to the control share acquisitions
statute and whose shares represent one-fifth or more, one-third
or more, or a majority or more of the voting power of the
corporation in the election of directors cannot exercise any
voting power with respect to those shares, or any shares
acquired by the person within 90 days before or after an
acquisition of this nature, unless these voting rights are
authorized by the stockholders of the corporation.

The authorization of voting rights requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares,
excluding shares owned by:

 

	the person making an acquisition of this nature;

 

	any officer of the corporation; and

 

	any employee who is also a director of the corporation.



There are several other types of share acquisitions that are not
subject to this provision of the Massachusetts corporation
statute, including acquisitions of shares:

 

	under a tender offer, merger or consolidation which is made in
	connection with an agreement to which the corporation is a
	party; and

 

	directly from the corporation or a wholly-owned subsidiary of
	the corporation.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

In order to be considered for addition to the agenda for
PerkinElmers 2002 annual meeting of stockholders and to be
included in the proxy statement for that meeting and form of
proxy, stockholder proposals should be addressed to the clerk of
PerkinElmer and must be received at the corporate offices of
PerkinElmer no later than November 13, 2001.

Stockholders who wish to make a proposal at PerkinElmers
2002 annual meeting, other than one that will be included in
PerkinElmers proxy materials, should notify PerkinElmer no
later than January 28, 2002. If a stockholder who wishes to
present a proposal fails to notify PerkinElmer by this date, the
proxies that management solicits for the meeting will have
discretionary authority to vote on the stockholders
proposal if it is properly brought before the meeting. If a
stockholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may still
exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances
consistent with the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Packard BioScience will hold an annual meeting in the year 2001
only if the merger has not already been completed. If Packard
BioScience holds an annual meeting, stockholders must submit
proposals by letter addressed to Packard BioScience in care of
its corporate secretary within a reasonable time before the
printing and mailing of the 2001 annual meeting proxy materials.
The deadline for notice of a proposal for which a stockholder
will conduct his or her own solicitation is the same. If a
proposal or nomination is not submitted by this time, the
management proxies will be allowed to use their discretionary
authority with respect to the stockholder proposal or nomination.

LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the shares of PerkinElmer common stock to be
issued in connection with the merger will be passed on for
PerkinElmer by Hale and Dorr LLP, Boston, Massachusetts. Certain
legal matters with respect to the federal income tax
consequences of the merger will be passed upon for PerkinElmer
by Hale and Dorr LLP, Boston, Massachusetts, and for Packard
BioScience by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, New York, New
York.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this Agreement),
dated as of July 13, 2001, is by and among PerkinElmer,
Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the Buyer), Pablo
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the Transitory Subsidiary),
and Packard BioScience Company, a Delaware corporation (the
Company).

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Buyer and the Company
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and their respective stockholders that the Buyer acquire the
Company;

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected
through a merger (the Merger) of the Transitory
Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the DGCL), as a result of which
the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the Buyers
willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) Stonington
Capital Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. has entered into a
Stockholders Agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit A

(the Stockholders Agreement) and
(ii) the individuals and entities listed in

Exhibit B 
hereto have each entered into Voting
Agreements, in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit C

(the Voting Agreements), pursuant to which,
among other things, such stockholders have agreed to give the
Buyer a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the
Company that such stockholders own in favor of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth below, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1  
Effective Time of the Merger.
 Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, the

of merger (the Certificate of Merger) in such form
as is required by, and executed by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the

Effective Time).

1.2

 The closing of the Merger (the
Closing) shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston

second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of
items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction
of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),

agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company.

1.3  
Effects of the Merger.
 At the Effective
Time (i) the separate existence of the Transitory

of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall

Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: The total
number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall
consist of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and, as
so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
further amended in accordance with the DGCL and (iii) the
By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to change all
references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary to refer to
the name of the Company, and, as so amended, such By-laws shall
be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4

 The directors and

Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1  
Conversion of Capital Stock.
 As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of
the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

	(a)  
Capital Stock of the Transitory
	Subsidiary.
 Each share of the common stock of the Transitory
	Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
	Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
	and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per
	share, of the Surviving Corporation.

	(b)  
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned
	Stock.
 All shares of common stock, $.002 par value per
	share, of the Company (Company Common Stock) that
	are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly
	owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common
	Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other
	wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the
	Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
	no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered
	in exchange therefor.

	(c)  
Conversion of Company Common Stock.

	Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock
	(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
	Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
	the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the
	right to receive 0.311 shares (the Exchange Ratio)
	of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Buyer
	(Buyer Common Stock) upon surrender of the
	certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in
	the manner provided in Section 2.2. The Exchange Ratio is
	sometimes referred to as the Merger Consideration.
	As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
	Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
	cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
	certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
	shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
	right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
	Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
	Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
	therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
	Section 2.2, without interest.

	(d)  
Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.
 In the
	event of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock
	dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
	convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
	the case may be), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
	change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Common
	Stock, as the case may be, occurring (or for which a record date
	is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
	Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to
	reflect fully such event.

A-9



	(e)  
Unvested Stock.
 At the Effective Time, any
	Merger Consideration issued or paid in accordance with
	Section 2.1(c) with respect to any unvested shares of
	Company Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or
	consultants pursuant to any of the Companys plans or
	arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
	Time shall remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and
	vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
	Time, except to the extent by their terms such unvested shares
	of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective Time. The Company
	shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate
	vesting of any unvested shares, except to the extent required by
	their terms as in effect on the date hereof. Copies of the
	relevant agreements governing such shares and the vesting
	thereof have been made available to the Buyer. All outstanding
	rights which the Company may hold immediately prior to the
	Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common
	Stock shall be assigned to the Buyer in the Merger and shall
	thereafter be exercisable by the Buyer upon the same terms and
	conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
	except that the shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and
	the purchase price payable per share shall be appropriately
	adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall take
	all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this
	Section 2.1(e) to occur.

	(f)  
Treatment of Company Stock Options.

	Following the Effective Time, Company Stock Options shall be
	treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.12.

2.2  
Exchange of Certificates.
 The procedures
for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

	(a)  
Exchange Agent.
 As of the Effective Time,
	the Buyer shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated
	by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
	Exchange Agent), for the benefit of the holders of
	shares of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
	with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent,
	(i) certificates representing that number of whole shares
	of Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of shares of
	Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
	(ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for
	fractional shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
	(iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of
	shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to
	Section 2.2(c). The shares of Buyer Common Stock deposited
	with the Exchange Agent pursuant to clause (i) above,
	together with any dividends or distributions with respect
	thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, and the
	cash deposited pursuant to clause (ii) above being
	hereinafter referred to as the Exchange Fund.

	(b)  
Exchange Procedures.
 As soon as reasonably
	practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
	mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
	which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
	outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the
	Certificates) whose shares were converted pursuant
	to Section 2.1 into the right to receive Merger
	Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
	specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
	title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
	Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
	have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify)
	and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
	Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (plus cash
	in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and
	any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon
	surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
	Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
	the Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
	executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
	by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
	entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate
	representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
	which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
	Section 2.1(c), (B) cash in an amount sufficient to
	make payments for fractional shares pursuant to the provisions
	of Section 2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or
	distributions pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(c),
	and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
	cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
	Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
	the Company, (x) a certificate representing the proper

A-10



	number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to
	Section 2.1(c), (y) the proper amount of cash in lieu
	of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
	(z) any dividends or distributions pursuant to
	Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid to a person other than
	the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
	registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
	Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
	effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
	transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated
	by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at
	any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
	receive upon such surrender (1) the Merger Consideration
	issuable or payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
	(2) cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
	Section 2.2(e) and (3) any dividends or distributions
	pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as contemplated by this
	Section 2.2.

	(c)  
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged
	Shares.
 No dividends or other distributions declared or made
	after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock with
	a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
	holder of any unsurrendered Certificate and no cash payment in
	lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
	pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of
	such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
	the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
	Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder
	of the Certificate, (i) certificates representing whole
	shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
	(ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
	payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to
	which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
	and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
	date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to
	such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, without interest and
	(iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
	dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
	Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
	subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
	shares of Buyer Common Stock.

	(d)  
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
	Stock.
 All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the
	surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
	terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
	distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or 2.2(e))
	shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
	satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
	Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall
	be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
	books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
	Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
	Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
	presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
	any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
	this Article II.

	(e)  
No Fractional Shares.
 No certificate or
	scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall
	be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
	such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
	thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the
	Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
	each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
	to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
	a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into
	account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
	receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
	equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock
	multiplied by the weighted average of the per share selling
	prices of the Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
	(NYSE) during the ten consecutive trading days
	ending on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.

	(f)  
Termination of Exchange Fund.
 Any portion
	of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders
	of Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective
	Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any
	holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied
	with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the
	Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim
	for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
	of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
	any dividends or distributions issued pursuant to
	Section 2.2(c).

A-11



	(g)  
No Liability.
 To the extent permitted by
	applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary,
	the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
	shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
	or Buyer Common Stock or to any other person for such shares of
	Buyer Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
	thereto) delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
	to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If
	any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one
	year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
	earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, and any cash in
	lieu of fractional shares payable to the holder of such
	Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or
	distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant
	to Section 2.2(c) would otherwise escheat to or become the
	property of any Governmental Entity), all such Merger

arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify (1) the
corresponding paragraph in this Article III and
(2) such other paragraphs in this Article III only to

3.1  
Organization, Standing and Power;

(a)  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

A-12



qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such

individually or in the aggregate, which have not resulted in,
and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the

and of itself, as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market,
(II) conditions, events or circumstances generally

taken as a whole, (III) conditions, events or circumstances
directly arising out of or directly attributable to (x) a

(IV) conditions, events or circumstances directly arising
out of or directly attributable to the public announcement of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not be taken into account in determining whether there has been
or would be a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b)  Neither the Company nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity, membership,
partnership or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity, membership,
partnership or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other
business association or entity, whether incorporated or
unincorporated. Neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, has, since January 1, 1998, been a general

and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries do not have a majority of
the voting interest in such partnership), (II) such party
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries holds voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing
body performing similar functions, or (III) such party
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,
owns or controls more than 50% of the equity, membership,
partnership or similar interests, and (ii) the term
Significant Subsidiary means a Subsidiary that would

deemed to include all of the Companys current, long-term
and other assets.

benefits accrued through the date of amendment or termination,
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof

communication distributed generally to employees by its terms
prohibits the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
party thereto or covered thereby from amending or terminating
any such Company Employee Plan.

SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to

payment as defined in Section 280G of the Code
determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code. The Company has provided to the Buyer such accurate

Permits.
 The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their
businesses (the Company Permits), except for such

result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would

result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits, and (ii) no Company Permit

 To the Companys
knowledge, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains

Warranty.
 The Company has no reason to
believe that the warranty costs of it and its Subsidiaries will
materially increase as a percentage of their consolidated
revenues in the future (assuming that management of the Company
and its Subsidiaries following the Closing will be undertaken in
a manner consistent with past practice). To the Companys

Subsidiaries have not performed warranty service with respect to
any particular product or product line materially in excess of
the warranty service typical
