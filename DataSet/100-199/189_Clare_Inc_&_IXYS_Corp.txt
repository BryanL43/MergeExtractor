To the Stockholders of IXYS Corporation and Clare, Inc.:

The Boards of Directors of IXYS Corporation and Clare, Inc. each have
unanimously approved a merger combining the business of Clare with the business
of IXYS. If the merger is completed, Clare will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of IXYS, and all outstanding shares of Clare common stock and all outstanding
options to purchase Clare common stock will be converted into shares of IXYS
common stock and options to purchase IXYS common stock, respectively. Each
outstanding share of Clare common stock will be converted into the right to
receive 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock, with cash to be paid in lieu of
any fractional share. Based on the number of shares of Clare common stock
outstanding on May 1, 2002, IXYS expects to issue approximately 4.89 million
shares of its common stock in the merger to Clare's current stockholders and to
assume options to purchase an additional approximately 1.02 million shares of
IXYS common stock held by Clare's option holders. Based on the number of
outstanding shares of Clare common stock and IXYS common stock, after the
merger, the current stockholders of Clare would own approximately 15.4% of IXYS.

IXYS common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
"SYXI" and closed at $7.81 per share on May 13, 2002. Clare common stock is
listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "CPCL" and closed at $3.73
per share on May 13, 2002.

Stockholders of IXYS will be asked at a special meeting to approve the issuance
of shares of IXYS common stock in the merger. The special meeting for IXYS
stockholders will be held at The Embassy Suites Hotel, 2885 Lakeside Drive,
Santa Clara, California, 95054 on Monday, June 10, 2002 at 10:00 a.m., local
time.

Stockholders of Clare will be asked at a special meeting to approve the merger
agreement and thereby approve the merger. The special meeting for Clare
stockholders will be held at Clare's headquarters at 78 Cherry Hill Drive,

                 NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF IXYS CORPORATION

                STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MONDAY, JUNE 10, 2002

To the Stockholders of IXYS Corporation:

A special meeting of the stockholders of IXYS Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, will be held on Monday, June 10, 2002 at 10:00 a.m. local time, at
The Embassy Suites Hotel, 2885 Lakeside Drive, Santa Clara, California, 95054,
for the purpose of considering and voting upon the following proposal:

     To approve the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger of Teacup
     Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS, with and into Clare,
     Inc. pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated
     as of April 22, 2002, by and among IXYS, Teacup Acquisition Corp. and
     Clare.

The IXYS board of directors has approved the merger agreement, the merger and
the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger and has determined that the
merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the stockholders of IXYS. Therefore, the IXYS board of
directors recommends that IXYS stockholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of
IXYS common stock in the merger. The proposal is described in more detail in the
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus, which we encourage you to read in
its entirety before voting. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex
A to the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The IXYS board of directors has fixed Monday, May 13, 2002 as the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting of IXYS stockholders and any adjournment or postponement
thereof. Only holders of record of shares of IXYS common stock at the close of
business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting of IXYS stockholders. At the close of business on the record
date, IXYS had outstanding and entitled to vote 26,894,223 shares of common
stock.

The approval of the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger will require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock
present at the IXYS special meeting, either in person or represented by proxy,
and entitled to vote on this proposal. Shares deemed to be present at the
special meeting but abstaining from the vote on the proposal to approve the
issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger will have the same effect as a vote
against this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted for any purpose in
determining whether this proposal has been approved. The failure of an IXYS
stockholder to return a proxy or to vote in person will not have the effect of a
vote for or against this proposal.

All properly signed and dated proxies that IXYS receives prior to the vote at
the special meeting of IXYS stockholders, and that are not subsequently revoked,
will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. All
properly signed and dated proxies received by IXYS prior to the vote at the
special meeting that do not provide any direction as to how to vote in regards
to the proposal will be voted for approval of the proposal.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES YOU OWN. Even if you
plan to attend the special meeting in person, please take the time to sign and
return the enclosed proxy card as described in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in accordance with the instructions accompanying the
proxy card, thus ensuring that your shares will be represented at the special
meeting. If you do attend the special meeting of IXYS stockholders and wish to
vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors,

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

The following section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the
merger and the effect of the merger on holders of IXYS common stock and Clare
common stock. This section, however, only provides summary information. For a
more complete response to these questions and for additional information, please
refer to the cross-referenced page for each question.

Q:  WHY ARE IXYS AND CLARE PROPOSING THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 44 AND 46)

     A: IXYS and Clare are proposing the merger because they believe the
     resulting combined organization will be a stronger, more competitive
     company capable of achieving greater financial strength, operational
     efficiencies, access to capital and growth potential than either company
     could separately achieve. IXYS and Clare further believe that the merger
     will provide the opportunity for each company's stockholders to participate
     in the potential growth of the combined organization following the merger.

     IXYS and Clare believe that the merger will result in a number of benefits,
     including:

      --   the synergies that could be created in combining the research,
           development and technological strengths of IXYS and Clare;

      --   The synergies that could be created in combining the sales and
           marketing functions of IXYS and Clare; and

      --   efficiencies created by eliminating redundant expenses; and

      --   improved utilization of Clare's wafer fabrication facility.

Q:  WHAT WILL A CLARE STOCKHOLDER RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR CLARE STOCK IN THE
MERGER? (SEE PAGE 61)

     A: If the merger is completed, each Clare stockholder will have the right
     to receive 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock and cash in lieu of any
     fractional share in exchange for each of his or her shares of Clare common
     stock. Regardless of fluctuations in the market prices of IXYS and Clare
     common stock, this number will not change between now and the date the
     merger is completed, but the value of the shares of IXYS common stock to be
     received by the Clare stockholders will vary as the market price of IXYS
     common stock changes. Based on the market price of IXYS common stock on May
     13, 2002, each share of Clare common stock would have a value of
     approximately $3.84.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF IXYS WILL THE FORMER CLARE STOCKHOLDERS AND OPTION
HOLDERS OWN COLLECTIVELY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MERGER?

     A: Upon completion of the merger, the former Clare stockholders will own
     approximately 15.3% of the outstanding common stock of IXYS, and the former
     Clare stockholders and option holders will collectively own approximately
     16.0% of IXYS on a fully diluted basis.

Q:  WILL CLARE STOCKHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE IXYS COMMON STOCK THAT THEY
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 58)

     A: Yes. IXYS common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the
     symbol "SYXI." However, 57.8% percent of the shares of Clare common stock
     are held by persons who are deemed to be affiliates of Clare. These
     affiliates will be required to comply with Rule 145 under the Securities
     Act of 1933 if they sell the shares of IXYS common stock they received in
     the merger.

     Additionally, as of April 22, 2002, Clare had obtained stock transfer
     restriction agreements from holders of approximately 1.5% of its shares.
     Each Clare stockholder who is a party to a stock transfer restriction
     agreement has agreed not to sell any shares of IXYS common stock received
     in the merger for 90 days after the merger.

Q:  WHO WILL BE THE DIRECTORS OF IXYS FOLLOWING THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 89)

     A: Following the merger, the board of directors of IXYS is expected to
     consist of seven members, of which six are expected to be the existing IXYS
     board members and one is expected to be the current president and chief

     executive officer of Clare, Mr. Larry Mihalchik.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED? (SEE PAGE 61)

     A: IXYS and Clare are working to complete the merger as quickly as
     possible. IXYS and Clare hope to complete the merger in the second or early
     in the third calendar quarter of 2002.

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 35
AND 38)

     A: For IXYS, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common
     stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting must approve
     the issuance of IXYS common stock in connection with the merger. Nathan
     Zommer, the president and chief executive officer of IXYS, who held
     approximately 24.9% of IXYS' total outstanding shares of common stock on
     April 22, 2002, has agreed to vote his shares in favor of the issuance of
     IXYS common stock in the merger.

     For Clare, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Clare common
     stock must approve the merger agreement and approve the merger. Directors
     and executive officers of Clare who held an aggregate of approximately 1.5%
     of Clare's total outstanding shares of common stock on April 22, 2002 have
     agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and the
     merger.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (SEE PAGES 36 AND 39)

     A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in and
     incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit your
     proxy card according to the instructions on the enclosed proxy card as soon
     as possible. Unless you submit a proxy card or attend the special meeting
     and vote in person, your shares will not be represented or voted at the
     meeting.

Q:  CAN I, AS AN IXYS STOCKHOLDER, SUBMIT MY PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR OVER THE
INTERNET?

     A: If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage firm, you may be
     able to submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet. You should
     refer to the proxy card included with your materials for instructions about
     how to vote. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you do not need
     to complete and mail your proxy card.

Q:  IF MY SHARES OF IXYS COMMON STOCK ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BANK OR
BROKER, WILL MY BANK OR BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGE 36)

     A: Your bank or broker will vote your shares only if you provide
     instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by
     your bank or broker.

     Without instructions from you on how to vote your shares, your bank or
     broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
     matters currently proposed to be presented at the special meeting. As a
     result, your bank or broker may deliver a proxy card expressly indicating
     that it is NOT voting your shares. This indication that a broker is not
     voting your shares is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes
     will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a
     quorum at the IXYS special meeting. However, a broker non-vote will not be
     entitled to vote on the proposal to approve the issuance of IXYS common
     stock in the merger, and thus a broker non-vote will not be counted for any
     purpose in determining whether this proposal has been approved.

Q:  IF I AM AN IXYS STOCKHOLDER, WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER
I HAVE SUBMITTED MY PROXY? (SEE PAGE 36)

     A: You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
     IXYS special meeting. There are three ways for you to do this:

      --   by delivering to the secretary of IXYS a signed notice that you wish
           to revoke your proxy;

      --   by delivering to the secretary of IXYS a signed and later-dated
           proxy; or

      --   by attending the IXYS special meeting and voting in person.

     If your shares are held in "street name" by a bank or broker and you have
     instructed your

     bank or broker to vote your shares, you must follow your bank's or broker's
     instructions to change your vote.

Q:  CAN I, AS A CLARE STOCKHOLDER, SUBMIT MY PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR OVER THE
INTERNET?

     A: If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage firm, you may be
     able to submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet. You should
     refer to the proxy card included with your materials for instructions about
     how to vote. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you do not need
     to complete and mail your proxy card.

Q:  IF MY SHARES OF CLARE COMMON STOCK ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BANK OR
BROKER, WILL MY BANK OR BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGE 39)

     A: Your bank or broker will vote your shares only if you provide
     instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by
     your bank or broker.

     Without instructions from you on how to vote your shares, your bank or
     broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
     matters currently proposed to be presented at the special meeting. As a
     result, your bank or broker may deliver a proxy card expressly indicating
     that it is NOT voting your shares. This indication that a broker is not
     voting your shares is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes
     will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a
     quorum at the Clare special meeting. However, a broker non-vote will not be
     entitled to vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
     merger contemplated thereby, and thus a broker non-vote will have the same
     effect as a vote against this proposal.

Q:  IF I AM A CLARE STOCKHOLDER, WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER
I HAVE SUBMITTED MY PROXY? (SEE PAGE 40)

     A: You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
     Clare special meeting. There are three ways for you to do this:

      --   by delivering to the clerk of Clare a signed notice that you wish to
           revoke your proxy;

      --   by delivering to the clerk of Clare a signed and later-dated proxy;
           or

      --   by attending the Clare special meeting and voting in person.

     If your shares are held in "street name" by a bank or broker and you have
     instructed your bank or broker to vote your shares, you must follow your
     bank's or broker's instructions to change your vote.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT VOTE? (SEE PAGES 35 AND 38)

     A: If you are an IXYS stockholder and you do not submit a proxy card or
     vote at the special meeting of IXYS stockholders, your shares will not be
     counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum and will have no
     effect on the outcome of the proposal to approve the issuance of IXYS
     common stock in the merger. If you submit a proxy card and affirmatively
     elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted for purposes of
     determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the special
     meeting. As a result, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote
     against the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger.

     If you are a Clare stockholder and you do not submit a proxy card or vote
     at the special meeting of Clare stockholders, your shares will not be
     counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum and will have the
     same effect as a vote against approval of the merger agreement and the
     merger. If you submit a proxy card and affirmatively elect to abstain from
     voting, your proxy will be counted for purposes of determining the presence
     of a quorum but will not be voted at the special meeting. As a result, your
     abstention will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the
     merger agreement and the merger.

Q:  SHOULD CLARE STOCKHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? (SEE PAGE
62)

     A: No. After the merger is completed, IXYS will send you written
     instructions for exchanging your Clare stock certificates for IXYS stock
     certificates.

Q:  WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS? (SEE PAGE 157)

     A: If you have any questions about the merger or any related transaction,
     please call the investor relations department at IXYS at (408) 982-0700 or
     at Clare at (978) 524-6700. You may also obtain additional information
     about IXYS or Clare from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission without charge upon written or oral request by following the
     instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

THE COMPANIES (SEE PAGES 95 AND 121)

IXYS CORPORATION

IXYS is a leading company in the design, development, manufacture and marketing
of high power, high performance power semiconductors. IXYS' power semiconductors
convert electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the
tightly regulated, efficient power quality required by electronic products.
Power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by processing and
converting electrical energy into more usable, higher quality power. IXYS
focuses on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing
greater than 500 watts of power, such as power systems for communications
infrastructure, motor drives for industry, and sophisticated medical
electronics.

IXYS' products are used primarily to control electricity in power conversion
systems for communications infrastructure applications, motor drives for
industrial applications and sophisticated medical electronics applications. In
fiscal year 2001, IXYS sold its products to over 2,000 customers worldwide.
Currently, IXYS' major customers include Agilent Technologies, ASCOM, Emerson
Electric, Eurotherm, Guidant, Medtronics, Rockwell International, Siemens and
Still. In many cases, IXYS' customers incorporate IXYS' products into systems
sold to their customers, who include Ericsson, General Electric, General Motors,
Hewlett Packard, IBM, Motorola and Nokia.

IXYS was founded in 1983 and is a Delaware corporation. IXYS' executive offices
are located at 3540 Bassett Street, Santa Clara, California 95054, and its
telephone number is (408) 982-0700. IXYS' website can be found at www.ixys.com.
The information found on IXYS' website is not a part of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

TEACUP ACQUISITION CORP.

Teacup Acquisition Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS that was recently
incorporated in Massachusetts solely for the purpose of the merger. It does not
conduct any business and has no material assets. Its principal executive offices
have the same address and telephone number as IXYS.

CLARE, INC.

Clare is a provider of high-voltage analog and mixed-signal semiconductor
integrated packages and discrete components to the world's leading manufacturers
of electronic communications, computer, and industrial equipment. Clare's
primary products supply the interface between transmission signals and
electronic devices by providing the basic isolation and switching functions
required by electronic communications applications. Clare sells its products
across its customer base of over 1,000 customers, including leading global
original equipment manufacturers such as Motorola, Xircom, Alcatel, Ericsson,
Lucent, Nokia, Samsung, Psion, and Siemens.

A technology leader in the semiconductor segment of the market for small signal
relays, Clare's semiconductor products integrate a number of functions
previously provided by discrete components into one package and have contributed
to the development of a number of new product applications such as

56K PCMCIA modems, modem interfaces to the Internet, cable set top boxes, and
other computer telephony uses such as voice mail systems. Clare also focuses on
providing solutions for the telecommunications and data communications markets
because of the significant use of analog semiconductor components and growing
demand for integrated semiconductor packages in these industries. Through its
acquisition of Micronix Integrated Systems, Inc. in July 1999 ("Clare
Micronix"), Clare began producing application specific integrated circuits as
well as application specific standard products including integrated circuit
drivers for organic light emitting diode displays.

Clare was founded in 1937 to design, manufacture and sell electromagnetic
products and was subsequently sold to General Instrument Corporation (GI) in
1967. Theta-J Corporation, founded in 1975 to design, manufacture and market
semiconductor based electronic components, purchased the Clare division of GI in
1989 and changed its name to C.P. Clare Corporation. During August 1999, after
its acquisition of Micronix Integrated Systems, Inc., Clare sold substantially
all of the electromagnetics business to Sumida Electric Company of Tokyo, Japan.
Subsequently, Clare's name was changed to Clare, Inc. Clare is incorporated
under the laws of Massachusetts. Clare maintains its principal offices at 78
Cherry Hill Drive, Beverly, Massachusetts, 01915 and its phone number is (978)
524-6700. Additional information, not part of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, regarding Clare or its Clare Micronix subsidiary may be
found at www.clare.com and www.claremicronix.com respectively.

SUMMARY OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 41)

If the merger is completed, Teacup Acquisition Corp. will merge with and into
Clare. Clare will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS, and Clare
stockholders will become stockholders of IXYS.

As a result of the merger, each share of Clare common stock will be converted
into 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock and cash will be paid for any
fractional share that would otherwise be issued in connection with the merger.
Each share of IXYS common stock outstanding prior to the merger will be
unaffected by the merger. The 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock that Clare
stockholders will receive in the merger is a fixed number. Regardless of
fluctuations in the market prices of IXYS and Clare common stock, this number
will not change between now and the date the merger is completed, but the value
of the shares of IXYS common stock to be received by the Clare stockholders may
vary if the market price of IXYS common stock changes.

Clare stockholders will receive shares of IXYS common stock representing
approximately 15.4% of the total number of shares of IXYS common stock
outstanding following the merger, based on shares outstanding on April 22, 2002.
On May 13, 2002, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, IXYS common stock closed at $7.81 per share on The
Nasdaq National Market.

Upon completion of the merger, IXYS will assume all outstanding options to
purchase Clare common stock. Each option to purchase Clare common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will become an
option to purchase, on the same terms, 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock
for each share of Clare common stock for which the option was exercisable, with
the option price to be adjusted accordingly.

We have attached the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs
the merger, as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage
you to read it carefully.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IXYS, CLARE AND THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 14)

The merger (including the possibility that the merger may not be completed)
poses a number of risks to each company and its respective stockholders. In
addition, both IXYS and Clare are subject to various risks associated with their
businesses and their industry. These risks are discussed in detail under the
caption "Risk Factors" beginning on page 14. IXYS and Clare both encourage you
to read and consider all of these risks carefully.

agreement and the merger.

agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and the merger.

Nathan Zommer, the President and Chief Executive Officer of IXYS, who held
approximately 24.9% of IXYS' total outstanding shares of common stock on April
22, 2002, has agreed to vote his shares in favor of the issuance of IXYS common
stock in the merger.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (SEE PAGE 59)

Upon completion of the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the
merger, the directors and officers of IXYS, along with those individuals who
have been directors and officers of IXYS since the beginning of the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2002, will collectively beneficially own approximately 25.5%

of the outstanding common stock of IXYS, calculated on the basis set forth under
"IXYS Principal Stockholders."

On April 22, 2002, Nathan Zommer, the President and Chief Executive Officer of
IXYS, held 6,000 shares of Clare common stock in his individual capacity.
Accordingly, as a holder of Clare common stock, Dr. Zommer will be entitled to
vote his shares of Clare common stock at the special meeting of Clare
stockholders and, upon completion of the merger, Dr. Zommer will receive shares
of IXYS common stock in exchange for the shares of Clare common stock he owns.

Upon completion of the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the
merger, the directors and executive officers of Clare, along with certain
individuals who were executive officers of Clare since the beginning of the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, will collectively beneficially own
approximately 1.1% of the outstanding common stock of IXYS, calculated on the
basis set forth under "IXYS Principal Stockholders."

Under the terms of the stock transfer restriction agreements signed by each of
the directors and executive officers of Clare, Clare's directors and executive
officers may not transfer for 90 days after the completion of the merger the
shares of IXYS common stock they receive in exchange for their Clare common
stock.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 61)

IXYS and Clare expect to complete the merger when all of the conditions to
completion of the merger contained in the merger agreement have been satisfied
or waived. The merger will become effective upon the filing of articles of
merger with the Massachusetts Secretary of State under applicable Massachusetts
law.

IXYS and Clare are working toward satisfying the conditions to the merger, and
hope to complete the merger as soon as practicable following the special
stockholder meetings.

RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS BY CLARE (SEE PAGE 67)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Clare may not solicit, initiate or,
subject to limited exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide material inside information to, any third party regarding some types of
extraordinary transactions involving either party, including a merger, business
combination or sale of a material amount of assets or capital stock.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 70)

IXYS' and Clare's obligations to complete the merger are subject to certain
conditions described under "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Completion
of the Merger."

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND PAYMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATION FEES (SEE
PAGES 72 AND 74)

IXYS and Clare may terminate the merger agreement by mutual agreement and under
certain other circumstances.

IXYS and Clare have agreed that if the merger agreement is terminated under the
circumstances described under "Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement -- Expenses
and Termination Fees," Clare will pay IXYS up to $2,700,000 in fees and
expenses. The merger agreement also provides that if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain other circumstances, IXYS will pay Clare up to $2,700,000
in fees and expenses.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 55)

Counsel to IXYS and Clare have delivered opinions, based on factual
representations by IXYS and Clare, that, subject to customary conditions,
limitations and qualifications, the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Accordingly, no gain or loss is expected to be recognized by the Clare
stockholders upon exchange of their

common stock in the merger (except with respect to any cash received in lieu of
a fractional share). You should carefully review the summary of the material
United States federal income tax consequences set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and consult with and rely solely upon your own tax advisor
to determine your particular tax consequences resulting from the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 54)

The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition using the purchase method of
accounting, pursuant to which IXYS will be treated as the acquiring entity.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 57)

Under Massachusetts law, Clare stockholders who do not vote for the approval of
the merger agreement and the merger may be entitled to certain dissenters'
appraisal rights. Stockholders who properly exercise and preserve their
dissenters' rights are entitled to receive payment in cash for the fair value of
their shares of Clare common stock.

The entire text of the Massachusetts statute governing dissenters' appraisal
rights is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. A Clare
stockholder's failure to comply with the procedures described in Annex C will
result in the loss of his or her dissenter's appraisal rights. Clare
stockholders are urged to read the text of the Massachusetts statute governing
dissenters' appraisal rights carefully.

IXYS stockholders are not entitled to any dissenters' or appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.

EXCHANGE OF CLARE STOCK CERTIFICATES (SEE PAGE 62)

If the merger is completed, Clare stockholders will receive a transmittal letter
from the exchange agent in the merger instructing Clare stockholders how to
exchange their Clare stock certificates for IXYS stock certificates. Clare
stockholders should not send any stock certificates until they have received
this instruction letter. If there are any questions, Clare stockholders may
contact IXYS' transfer agent, Mellon Investor Services, at 235 Montgomery
Street, 23rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. Clare stockholders should not
contact Mellon Investor Services with questions about the exchange of
certificates or the merger until after the merger has been completed.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

IXYS and Clare believe that the merger is not subject to the reporting
obligations, statutory waiting periods or other approvals of any government
agency.

TRANSFERABILITY OF IXYS COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE 58)

All shares of IXYS common stock received by Clare stockholders in the merger
will be freely transferable unless you are deemed to be an affiliate of Clare
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Shares of IXYS common stock
received by affiliates of Clare at the time the merger is submitted to the Clare
stockholders for vote may only be sold pursuant to Rule 145 of the Securities
Act or pursuant to a registrations statement or exemption from the requirements
of the Securities Act.

Additionally, as of April 22, 2002, Clare had obtained stock transfer
restriction agreements from holders of approximately 1.5% of its shares. Each
Clare stockholder who is a party to a stock transfer restriction agreement has
agreed not to sell any shares of IXYS common stock received in the merger for 90
days after the merger.

RECENT SHARE PRICES OF IXYS COMMON STOCK AND CLARE COMMON STOCK

The following table presents the per share closing price of IXYS common stock
and Clare common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on April 22, 2002, the last
completed trading day prior to the signing and announcement of the merger
agreement, and on May 13, 2002, the last practicable trading day prior to the
printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The following table also sets
forth the equivalent prices per share of Clare common stock. The equivalent
price per share of Clare common stock is equal to the closing price of a share
of IXYS common stock on the applicable date multiplied by 0.49147, the fraction
of a share of IXYS common stock to be issued in the merger in exchange for each
share of Clare common stock. The equivalent per share prices reflect the market
value of IXYS common stock that Clare stockholders would receive for each share
of Clare common stock if the merger had been completed on the specific dates.

                                                                                      EQUIVALENT

The foregoing tables show only historical comparisons. These comparisons may not
provide meaningful information to Clare stockholders in determining whether to
approve the merger agreement and the merger or to IXYS stockholders in
determining whether to approve the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger.
Because the number of shares of IXYS common stock to be issued to the holders of
Clare common stock is fixed, changes in the market price of IXYS common stock
will affect the dollar value of IXYS common stock to be received by stockholders
of Clare in the merger. Clare stockholders are urged

to obtain current market quotations for IXYS common stock, and to review
carefully the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, prior to considering whether to approve the merger
agreement and the merger.

Following the merger, IXYS common stock will continue to be listed on The Nasdaq
National Market and there will be no further market for Clare's common stock.

DIVIDENDS

To date, neither IXYS nor Clare has ever declared or paid cash dividends.

RECENT OPERATING RESULTS

On May 9, 2002, IXYS released its unaudited financial results for its fourth
quarter and its fiscal year ended March 31, 2002. IXYS reported net revenues of
$20.4 million and a net loss of $374,000, or ($0.01) per diluted share, for the
quarter. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, IXYS reported net revenues of
$82.8 million and a net income of $0.07 per diluted share for the fiscal year.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

The following table presents comparative historical per share data regarding the
net income (loss) and book value per share of each of IXYS and Clare, unaudited
pro forma per share data of IXYS and Clare as a combined organization after
giving effect to the merger as a purchase of Clare by IXYS assuming the
transaction had been completed on April 1, 2000 for pro forma net loss data and
on December 31, 2001 for book value per share data. The following data for IXYS
and Clare assumes that 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock will be issued in
exchange for each share of Clare common stock and the assumption of Clare
options based upon the same exchange ratio. This data has been derived from and
should be read in conjunction with the summary selected historical consolidated
financial data contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and
the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
of each of IXYS and Clare. The unaudited combined pro forma per share data is
presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily an indication
of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition that would have
been achieved had the merger been completed as of the date presented, and should
not be taken as representative of future consolidated results of operations or
financial condition of IXYS.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following selected unaudited pro forma financial information should be read
in conjunction with the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed
Financial Statements" included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For purposes of the pro forma information, the IXYS and
Clare statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 and the nine
month period ended December 31, 2001 have been combined. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations gives effect to the merger as if it
had occurred on April 1, 2000. The IXYS and Clare unaudited balance sheets as of
December 31, 2001 and December 23, 2001 have been combined as if the merger had
occurred on December 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the financial position or operating results that would
have actually occurred had the merger been consummated at the beginning of the
period indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future financial position
or operating results.

                                  RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference
into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus, IXYS stockholders and Clare
stockholders should consider the following risk factors in evaluating whether to
vote for the approval of the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger and the
approval of the merger agreement and the merger, respectively. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to IXYS and Clare, or that are not
currently believed to be important to IXYS and Clare stockholders, if they
materialize, also may adversely affect the merger and IXYS and Clare as a
combined organization.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

CLARE STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE A FIXED FRACTION OF A SHARE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK
IN THE MERGER, NOT A FIXED VALUE, AND NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXCHANGE RATIO WILL
BE MADE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK OR CLARE
COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, THE VALUE OF THE
IXYS COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY CLARE'S STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER WILL DEPEND ON
ITS MARKET PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

Upon completion of the merger, each share of Clare common stock will be
exchanged for 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock. The exchange ratio will
not change even if the market price of IXYS common stock or Clare common stock
fluctuates. In addition, neither party may withdraw from the merger, and Clare
may not resolicit the vote of its stockholders, solely because of changes in the
market price of IXYS common stock. The specific dollar value of IXYS common
stock that Clare stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger will
depend on the market price of IXYS common stock at that time. The market price
of IXYS common stock upon and after completion of the merger could be lower than
the market price on the date of the merger agreement or the current market
price. Additionally, Clare stockholders will not know the exact value of IXYS
common stock to be issued to Clare stockholders in the merger at the time of the
special meeting of Clare's stockholders. The market price of IXYS common stock,
like that of the shares of many other high-technology companies, has been and
may continue to be volatile. For example, from April 1, 2001 to May 13, 2002,
IXYS common stock traded as high as $18.10 per share and as low as $4.90 per
share. Clare stockholders are urged to obtain recent market quotations for IXYS
and Clare common stock.

IXYS AND CLARE MAY NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS THEY EXPECT FROM THE MERGER.

The integration of Clare's business, products and personnel into IXYS will be
complex and time-consuming and may disrupt the business of the combined
organization. The combined organization will need to overcome significant
challenges in order to realize the expected benefits or synergies from the
merger. These challenges include the timely, efficient and successful execution
of a number of post-merger events, including integrating Clare's operations and
technologies into IXYS', retaining and assimilating key Clare personnel,
coordinating Clare's research and development and sales and marketing efforts
with those of IXYS and creating uniform standards, controls, procedures,
policies and information systems.

The execution of these post-merger events will involve considerable risks and
may not be successful. These risks include:

      --   the potential disruption of the combined organization's ongoing
           business and distraction of its management from the day-to-day
           operations of the combined organization;

      --   the expected costs associated with integrating Clare's business with
           IXYS;

      --   the potential strain on the combined organization's financial and
           managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;

      --   unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of
           the operations, technology and other resources of the two companies;

      --   the impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and
           customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;
           and

      --   potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger and the
           operations of the combined organization.

The combined organization may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other
problems encountered in connection with the merger. The inability to integrate
the operations, technology and personnel of IXYS and Clare successfully, or any
significant delay in achieving integration, could have a material adverse effect
on the combined organization after the merger and, as a result, on the market
price of IXYS common stock.

INTEGRATING THE COMPANIES MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS.

IXYS may incur significant costs integrating IXYS and Clare into a single
business. These costs may include costs for:

      --   employee redeployment, relocation or severance;

      --   conversion of information systems;

      --   combination of teams and processes in various functional areas; and

      --   reorganization or closures of facilities.

IXYS' GROSS MARGIN AND NET INCOME MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF IXYS IS NOT ABLE
TO FULLY UTILIZE, OR REDUCE THE EXPENSES OF, CLARE'S BEVERLY, MASSACHUSETTS
WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY.

As a result of the merger, IXYS will assume Clare's lease of its wafer
fabrication facility in Beverly, Massachusetts. Customer demand for wafer
fabrication has not historically been adequate to allow Clare to utilize the
fabrication facility's full capacity and, as a result, Clare has incurred
substantial negative cash flow associated with the facility. If IXYS is not able
to increase the utilization of the fabrication facility, identify new customers
for Clare's fabrication services, expand orders from current customers or reduce
expenses at the facility, then IXYS could incur significant negative cash flow.
If IXYS attempts to shift fabrication of any of Clare's or IXYS' current
products to the Clare fabrication facility, IXYS may incur costs, such as costs
associated with qualifying the facility with customers. As a result, fabrication
at the Clare facility could be more costly than IXYS' current fabrication
suppliers.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IXYS WILL BE A LARGER AND BROADER ORGANIZATION, AND
IF IXYS' MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO MANAGE THE COMBINED ORGANIZATION, ITS OPERATING
RESULTS WILL SUFFER.

As a result of the merger, IXYS will acquire approximately 235 employees based
at Clare's headquarters in Beverly, Massachusetts and at its facilities in Aliso
Viejo, California, Belgium and Taiwan. As a result, IXYS will face challenges
inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large
geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems,
policies, benefits and compliance programs. The inability to manage successfully
the geographically more diverse and substantially larger combined organization,
or any significant delay in achieving successful management, could have a
material adverse effect on IXYS after the merger and, as a result, on the market
price of IXYS' common stock.

THE MERGER COULD CAUSE CLARE TO LOSE KEY PERSONNEL, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY
AFFECT THE COMBINED ORGANIZATION'S BUSINESS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO
RECRUIT REPLACEMENTS FOR LOST PERSONNEL.

As a result of Clare's change in ownership, current and prospective Clare
employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles within the
combined organization. This uncertainty may adversely affect the ability of
Clare to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical
personnel. In addition, in connection with the merger, current employees of
Clare will be entitled to acceleration of vesting of stock options, which may
adversely affect the ability of IXYS to retain such employees

following the merger. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have
a material adverse effect on the businesses of Clare and IXYS.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER MAY RESULT IN IXYS OR CLARE PAYING A TERMINATION
FEE TO THE OTHER. SUCH A FAILURE COULD ALSO RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE MARKET
PRICE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK OR CLARE COMMON STOCK AND COULD RESULT IN EACH
COMPANY NEVERTHELESS INCURRING LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING FEES.

If the merger is not completed, IXYS and Clare may be subject to a number of
material risks, including:

      --   if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances
           described in the merger agreement, IXYS or Clare will be required to
           pay the other party a termination fee of up to $2,700,000;

      --   the market price of IXYS common stock or Clare common stock may
           decline to the extent that their respective current prices reflect a
           market assumption that the merger will be completed; and

      --   IXYS' and Clare's costs related to the merger, such as legal,
           accounting and certain financial advisory fees, must be paid even if
           the merger is not completed.

In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated and Clare's board of
directors determines that Clare's best interest would be served by seeking
another merger or business combination, there can be no assurance that Clare
will be able to find another party willing to pay an equivalent or more
attractive price than the price IXYS has agreed to pay in the merger.

THE MARKET PRICE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

The market price of IXYS common stock may decline as a result of the merger if:

      --   the integration of Clare's business is unsuccessful;

      --   IXYS does not achieve the expected benefits of the merger as rapidly
           or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors; or

      --   the effect of the merger on financial results is not consistent with
           the expectations of financial analysts or investors.

CHARGES TO EARNINGS RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE PURCHASE METHOD OF
ACCOUNTING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING
THE MERGER.

In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, IXYS
will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting. The
combined organization will allocate the total estimated purchase price to
Clare's net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets based on their fair
values as of the date of completion of the merger, and record the excess of the
purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. IXYS will incur additional
amortization expenses over the estimated useful lives of certain of the
intangible assets acquired in connection with the merger, which are, based on
preliminary estimates, expected to be approximately $0.9 million and additional
depreciation of plant and equipment of approximately $1.4 million on an annual
basis over the next 3 to 6 years. In addition, to the extent the value of
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, IXYS may
be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those
assets.

SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF IXYS AND CLARE HAVE CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

Some of IXYS' and Clare's executive officers and directors may have been
influenced to approve the merger because of arrangements that provide them with
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the
interests of IXYS and Clare stockholders in the merger. For a more complete
description of the interests of IXYS' and Clare's executive officers and
directors, see the sections entitled

"The Merger -- Interests of IXYS' Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger" and "The Merger -- Interests of Clare's Executive Officers and Directors
in the Merger," respectively.

RISKS RELATED TO IXYS' BUSINESS

IXYS' OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS,
MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL.

IXYS' operating results may fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that
may affect its quarterly and annual results are:

      --   the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers;

      --   fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product
           shipments;

      --   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;

      --   fluctuations in its manufacturing yields and significant yield
           losses;

      --   availability of production capacity;

      --   changes in the mix of products that its customers purchase;

      --   competitive pressures on selling prices;

      --   the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and
           returns;

      --   the amount and timing of investments in research and development;

      --   market acceptance of its products;

      --   changes in its product distribution channels and the timeliness of
           receipt of distributor resale information;

      --   the impact of vacation schedules and holidays, largely during the
           second and third fiscal quarters of its fiscal year; and

      --   difficulties in forecasting demand for its products and the planning
           and managing of inventory levels.

As a result of these factors, many of which are difficult to control or predict,
as well as the other risk factors discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, IXYS may experience material adverse fluctuations in its
future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND AN INDUSTRY DOWNTURN COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT IXYS' OPERATING RESULTS.

Business conditions in the semiconductor industry have rapidly changed from
periods of strong demand. The industry is characterized by:

      --   periods of overcapacity and production shortages;

      --   cyclical demand for semiconductors;

      --   changes in product mix in response to changes in demand;

      --   variations in manufacturing costs and yields;

      --   rapid technological change and the introduction of new products;

      --   significant price erosion; and

      --   significant expenditures for capital equipment and product
           development.

These factors could harm IXYS' business and cause its operating results to
suffer.

IXYS' ABILITY TO GROW AND SUSTAIN GROWTH LEVELS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE
RECENT SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY.

Due to the recent decrease in corporate profits, capital spending and consumer
confidence, IXYS has experienced weakness in certain of its end markets. IXYS
markets its products to several commercial markets, including telecommunications
infrastructure, medical electronics and industrial motor drives, which have been
affected by the recent slowdown in the U.S. economy. If the economic slowdown
continues, IXYS' business, financial condition and results of operations may be
adversely affected.

IXYS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO MEET THE
PRESENT OR FUTURE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

The semiconductor industry has been characterized by periodic limitations on
production capacity. IXYS' current customer demand exceeds its ability to
manufacture internally or externally products to meet this demand. If IXYS is
unable to increase its production capacity to meet demand, some of its customers
may seek other sources of supply or its future growth may be limited.

IXYS COULD BE HARMED BY LITIGATION INVOLVING PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS.

As a general matter, the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial
litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Although
none of IXYS' patents or other intellectual property rights has been
successfully challenged to date, it has been sued on occasion for purported
patent infringement. For example, IXYS has recently been sued by International
Rectifier for purportedly infringing some of its patents covering power MOSFETs.
International Rectifier has asked the court to enjoin IXYS from continuing
infringement and to award treble damages against IXYS for the infringement of
International Rectifier's patents. IXYS has denied infringement of International
Rectifier's patents and has asserted affirmative defenses to its claims. The
U.S. District Court has dismissed IXYS' affirmative defenses and granted
International Rectifier's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of
infringement of three International Rectifier patents. Trial on the remaining
issues is scheduled to commence on June 25, 2002. IXYS intends to appeal the
U.S. District Court's rulings, and to contest International Rectifier's claims
vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain. See "IXYS'
Business -- Legal Proceedings."

Additionally, in the future, IXYS could be accused of infringing the
intellectual property rights of other third parties. IXYS also has certain
indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of
third party intellectual property rights by its products. No assurance can be
provided that any future infringement claims by third parties or claims for
indemnification by customers or end users of IXYS products resulting from
infringement claims will not be asserted or that assertions of infringement, if
proven to be true, will not harm its business.

In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation,
including the pending litigation with International Rectifier, IXYS could be
required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of
infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a
license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment
obligations by IXYS. An adverse decision in the International Rectifier
litigation or any other infringement could materially and adversely affect IXYS'
financial condition and results of operations.

Any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties,
whether or not determined in IXYS' favor or settled by IXYS, is costly and may
divert the efforts and attention of its management and technical personnel.

IXYS DEPENDS ON EXTERNAL FOUNDRIES TO MANUFACTURE MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS.

Fifty-seven percent of IXYS' revenues in fiscal year 2001 and forty-seven
percent of its revenues for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2001 came
from wafers manufactured for it by external foundries. IXYS' dependence on
external foundries may grow. IXYS has arrangements with four wafer foundries,

two of which produce substantially all of the wafers that IXYS purchases from
external foundries. Samsung Electronics' facility in Kiheung, South Korea is
IXYS' principal external foundry.

IXYS' relationships with its external foundries do not guarantee prices,
delivery or lead times, or wafer or product quantities sufficient to satisfy
current or expected demand. These foundries manufacture IXYS' products on a
purchase order basis. IXYS provides these foundries with rolling forecasts of
its production requirements; however, the ability of each foundry to provide
wafers to IXYS is limited by the foundry's available capacity. At any given
time, these foundries could choose to prioritize capacity for their own use or
other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to IXYS on short notice.
Accordingly, IXYS cannot be certain that these foundries will allocate
sufficient capacity to satisfy IXYS' requirements. In addition, IXYS cannot be
certain that it will continue to do business with these or other foundries on
terms as favorable as its current terms. If IXYS is not able to obtain
additional foundry capacity as required, its relationships with its customers
could be harmed and its revenues would likely be reduced. Moreover, even if IXYS
is able to secure additional foundry capacity, it may be obligated to utilize
all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties could be expensive and
could harm its operating results. Other risks associated with IXYS' reliance on
external foundries include:

      --   the lack of control over delivery schedules;

      --   the unavailability of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process
           technologies;

      --   limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and
           production costs; and

      --   potential misappropriation of its intellectual property.

IXYS' requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production
of the external foundries that manufacture its wafers and products. IXYS cannot
be certain these external foundries will continue to devote resources to the
production of its wafers and products or continue to advance the process design
technologies on which the manufacturing of its products is based. These
circumstances could harm IXYS' ability to deliver its products on time or
increase its costs.

IXYS' SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS EFFICIENTLY.

IXYS manufactures its products in facilities that are owned and operated by it,
as well as in external wafer foundries and independent subcontract assembly
facilities. The fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise
process, and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous
die on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of, among other factors:

      --   minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment;

      --   defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer;

      --   manufacturing equipment failure; or

      --   wafer breakage.

For these and other reasons, IXYS could experience a decrease in manufacturing
yields. Additionally, as IXYS increases its manufacturing output, it may also
experience a decrease in manufacturing yields. As a result, it may not be able
to cost effectively expand its production capacity in a timely manner.

IXYS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ADEQUATELY.

IXYS' ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its intellectual
property rights. IXYS relies on a combination of patents, trademarks,
copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure and
licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite
these efforts, IXYS cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect its
proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its
technology, or that its competitors will not independently develop technology
that is substantially similar or superior to its technology. More specifically,
IXYS cannot assure you that its pending patent applications or any future
applications will be approved, or that any issued patents will

provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third
parties. Nor can IXYS assure you that, if challenged, its patents will be found
to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others will not have an
adverse effect on its ability to do business. Furthermore, others may
independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate IXYS' products or
processes or design their products around any patents that may be issued to
IXYS.

IXYS' INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE IT TO MATERIAL RISKS.

During fiscal year 2001, IXYS' product sales by region were approximately 40.0%
in North America, approximately 42.6% in Europe and the Middle East and
approximately 17.4% in Asia; for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2001,
IXYS' product sales by region were approximately 34.6% in North America,
approximately 48.2% in Europe and the Middle East, approximately 15.7% in Asia
and approximately 1.5% from other regions. IXYS expects revenues from foreign
markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues. IXYS
maintains significant operations in Germany and the United Kingdom and contracts
with suppliers and manufacturers in South Korea, Japan and elsewhere in Europe
and Asia. Some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally are:

      --   foreign currency fluctuations;

      --   changes in the laws, regulations or policies of the countries in
           which IXYS manufactures or sells its products;

      --   trade restrictions;

      --   transportation delays;

      --   work stoppages; and

      --   economic or political instability.

IXYS' sales of products manufactured in its Lampertheim, Germany facility and
its costs at that facility are denominated in Euros, and sales of products
manufactured in its Chippenham, U.K. facility and its costs at that facility are
primarily denominated in British pounds and Euros. Fluctuations in the value of
the Euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar could have a significant
impact on IXYS' balance sheet and results of operations, including its net
income. IXYS currently does not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions
to control or minimize these risks. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates
could cause IXYS' products to become more expensive to customers in a particular
country, leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country. If
IXYS expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to
denominate prices in other foreign currencies, it could be exposed to even
greater risks of currency fluctuations.

In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect IXYS'
products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws
regarding the manufacture and sale of IXYS' products in the U.S. Therefore, the
risk of piracy of IXYS' technology and products may be greater when it
manufactures or sells its products in these foreign countries.

IXYS' REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON ITS PRODUCTS BEING DESIGNED INTO ITS
CUSTOMERS' PRODUCTS.

Some of IXYS' new products are incorporated into customers' products or systems
at the design stage. The value of any design win largely depends upon the
commercial success of the customer's product and on the extent to which the
design of the customer's electronic system also accommodates incorporation of
components manufactured by IXYS' competitors. In addition, IXYS' customers could
subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require
its products. IXYS may not achieve design wins or its design wins may not result
in future revenues.

BECAUSE IXYS' PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE LENGTHY SALES CYCLES, IXYS MAY EXPERIENCE
SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS BETWEEN INCURRING EXPENSES RELATED TO RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THE GENERATION OF REVENUES.

The time from initiation of design to volume production of new power
semiconductor products often takes 18 months or longer. IXYS first works with
customers to achieve a design win, which may take nine months or longer. Its
customers then complete the design, testing and evaluation process and begin to
ramp up production, a period which may last an additional nine months or longer.
As a result, a significant period of time may elapse between IXYS' research and
development efforts and its realization of revenues, if any, from volume
purchasing of its products by its customers.

IXYS' BACKLOG MAY NOT RESULT IN FUTURE REVENUES.

IXYS' business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules.
Customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without penalty to the
customer. As a result, IXYS' backlog at any particular date is not necessarily
indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period. A reduction of backlog
during any particular period, or the failure of its backlog to result in future
revenues, could harm its results of operations.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH IXYS PARTICIPATES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE.

Certain of IXYS' target markets are intensely competitive. IXYS' ability to
compete successfully in its target markets depends on the following factors:

      --   product quality, reliability and performance;

      --   product features;

      --   timely delivery of products;

      --   price;

      --   breadth of product line;

      --   design and introduction of new products; and

      --   technical support and service.

In addition, IXYS' competitors or customers may offer new products based on new
technologies, industry standards or end user or customer requirements, including
products that have the potential to replace, or provide lower cost or higher
performance alternatives to, IXYS' products. The introduction of new products by
IXYS' competitors or customers could render its existing and future products
obsolete or unmarketable.

IXYS' primary competitors include Advanced Power Technology, Fuji, International
Rectifier, Infineon, On Semiconductor, Semikron International, Powerex,
STMicroelectronics, Siemens and Toshiba. Many of IXYS' competitors have greater
financial, technical, marketing and management resources than it has. Some of
these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it
would be profitable for IXYS to sell its products or benefit from established
customer relationships that provide them with a competitive advantage.

IXYS RELIES ON ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL MANY OF ITS
PRODUCTS.

A substantial majority of IXYS' products are sold through distributors and sales
representatives. IXYS' distributors and sales representatives could reduce or
discontinue sales of its products. They may not devote the resources necessary
to sell IXYS' products in the volumes and within the time frames that IXYS
expects. In addition, IXYS depends upon the continued viability and financial
resources of these distributors and sales representatives, some of which are
small organizations with limited working capital. These distributors and sales
representatives, in turn, depend substantially on general economic conditions

and conditions within the semiconductor industry. IXYS believes that its success
will continue to depend upon these distributors and sales representatives.

At December 31, 2001, one distributor accounted for approximately 13% of IXYS'
outstanding receivables. If this or any other distributor or sales
representative experiences financial difficulties, or otherwise becomes unable
or unwilling to promote and sell IXYS' products, IXYS' business could be harmed.

IXYS' FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF MANAGEMENT AND KEY
ENGINEERING PERSONNEL AND ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL
PERSONNEL.

IXYS' success depends, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities
of Nathan Zommer, Ph.D., its president and chief executive officer, and other
members of senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of IXYS'
senior management or other key employees could adversely affect its business.
IXYS does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its officers,
employees or consultants.

There is intense competition for qualified employees in the semiconductor
industry, particularly for highly skilled design, applications and test
engineers. Competition is especially intense in the Silicon Valley, where IXYS'
U.S. design facility is located. IXYS may not be able to continue to attract and
retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of
its business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could
leave IXYS at any time in the future. IXYS' anticipated growth is expected to
place increased demands on its resources, and will likely require the addition
of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional
expertise by existing management employees. If IXYS loses the services of or
fails to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel, its
business could be harmed.

PERIODS OF RAPID GROWTH AND EXPANSION COULD CONTINUE TO PLACE A SIGNIFICANT
STRAIN ON IXYS' RESOURCES, INCLUDING ITS EMPLOYEE BASE.

To manage its possible future growth effectively, IXYS will be required to
continue to improve its operational, financial and management systems. In doing
so, IXYS will periodically implement new software and other systems that will
affect its internal operations regionally or globally. Presently, IXYS is
upgrading its enterprise resource planning software to integrate its operations
worldwide. The conversion process is complex and requires, among other things,
that data from its existing system be made compatible with the upgraded system.
During the transition to this upgrade, IXYS could experience delays in ordering
materials, inventory tracking problems and other inefficiencies, which could
cause delays in shipments of products to its customers.

Future growth will also require IXYS to successfully hire, train, motivate and
manage its employees. In addition, IXYS' continued growth and the evolution of
its business plan will require significant additional management, technical and
administrative resources. IXYS may not be able to effectively manage the growth
and evolution of its current business.

IXYS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.

IXYS has in the past made, and may in the future make, acquisitions. These
acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:

      --   diversion of management's attention;

      --   failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;

      --   amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could depress
           future earnings;

      --   customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired
           company;

      --   the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired
           operations; and

      --   assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated
           events or circumstances.

IXYS cannot assure that it will be able to successfully acquire other businesses
or product lines or integrate them into its operations without substantial
expense, delay in implementation or other operational or financial problems.

IXYS' STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE.

The market price of IXYS' common stock has fluctuated significantly to date. See
"IXYS Market Price and Dividend Information." The future market price of IXYS'
common stock may also fluctuate significantly due to:

      --   variations in IXYS' actual or expected quarterly operating results;

      --   announcements or introductions of new products;

      --   technological innovations by IXYS' competitors or development
           setbacks by IXYS;

      --   conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets;

      --   the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation;

      --   changes in analysts' estimates of IXYS' performance or changes in
           analysts' forecasts regarding IXYS' industry, competitors or
           customers;

      --   announcements of merger or acquisition transactions; or

      --   general economic and market conditions.

In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology
companies, including semiconductor companies. These fluctuations have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in IXYS'
industry, and could harm the market price of IXYS' common stock.

IXYS' DEPENDENCE ON INDEPENDENT SUBCONTRACTORS TO ASSEMBLE AND TEST ITS PRODUCTS
SUBJECTS IT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS AND
HIGHER MATERIALS COSTS.

IXYS depends on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of its
products. During fiscal year 2001 and the nine-month period ended December 31,
2001, the majority of IXYS' products were assembled by independent
subcontractors. IXYS' reliance on these subcontractors involves the following
significant risks:

      --   reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;

      --   the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess
           demand;

      --   difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors;

      --   limited warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products
           supplied to IXYS;

      --   potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other
           factors; and

      --   potential misappropriation of its intellectual property.

These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs, which would
harm IXYS' profitability and customer relationships.

In addition, IXYS uses a limited number of subcontractors to assemble a
significant portion of its products. If one or more of these subcontractors
experiences financial, operational, production or quality assurance
difficulties, IXYS could experience a reduction or interruption in supply.
Although IXYS believes alternative subcontractors are available, IXYS' operating
results could temporarily suffer until its engages one or more of those
alternative subcontractors.

IXYS' MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND IXYS' SUCCESS DEPENDS ON
ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS.

The markets for IXYS' products are characterized by:

      --   changing technologies;

      --   changing customer needs;

      --   frequent new product introductions and enhancements;

      --   increased integration with other functions; and

      --   product obsolescence.

To develop new products for its target markets, IXYS must develop, gain access
to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and
continue to expand its technical and design expertise. Failure to do so could
cause IXYS to lose its competitive position and seriously impact its future
revenues.

IXYS' OPERATING EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED, AND IT MAY ORDER MATERIALS IN
ADVANCE OF ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND. THEREFORE, IXYS HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO
REDUCE EXPENSES QUICKLY IN RESPONSE TO ANY REVENUE SHORTFALLS.

IXYS' operating expenses are relatively fixed, and, therefore, it has limited
ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls.
Consequently, IXYS' operating results will be harmed if its revenues do not meet
its revenue projections.

IXYS also typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal
forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate
substantially. From time to time, in response to anticipated long lead times to
obtain inventory and materials from its external suppliers and foundries, IXYS
may order materials or production in advance of anticipated customer demand.
This advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated
inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize.

REGULATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT IXYS' ABILITY TO SELL ITS PRODUCTS.

Power semiconductors with operating voltages above 40 volts are subject to
regulations intended to address the safety, reliability and quality of the
products. These regulations relate to processes, design, materials and assembly.
For example, in the United States some high voltage products are required to
pass Underwriters Laboratory recognition for voltage isolation and fire hazard
tests. Sales of power semiconductors outside of the United States are subject to
international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The
process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances can be
lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The time required to obtain approval for sale
internationally may be longer than that required for U.S. approval, and the
requirements may differ.

In addition, approximately 13% of IXYS' revenues in fiscal year 2001 were
derived from the sale of products included in medical devices that are subject
to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United
States and internationally, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA. The FDA and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous
requirements for medical device manufacturers to meet, including adherence to
Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, regulations and similar regulations in
other countries, which include testing, control and documentation requirements.
Ongoing compliance with GMP and other applicable regulatory requirements is
monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies, including
the FDA, and by comparable agencies in other countries. IXYS' failure to comply
with applicable regulatory requirements could prevent its products from being
included in approved medical devices.

IXYS' business could also be harmed by delays in receiving or the failure to
receive required approvals or clearances, the loss of previously obtained
approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future
regulatory requirements.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS MAY DAMAGE IXYS' FACILITIES OR THOSE OF ITS SUPPLIERS.

IXYS' operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other
natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure and other
events beyond its control. IXYS does not have a detailed disaster recovery plan
and does not have backup generators. IXYS' corporate headquarters in California
is located near major earthquake fault lines and has experienced earthquakes in
the past. California also has recently been subject to shortages of electrical
power and is subject to power outages. If power outages occur, IXYS' ability to
conduct administrative matters and test its products could be seriously
impaired, which could harm its business, financial condition and results of
operations. IXYS cannot be sure that the insurance it maintains against general
business interruptions will be adequate to cover all its losses.

In addition, some of IXYS' suppliers are located in California and are subject
to the same earthquake and power outage risks. A fire, major earthquake or other
natural disaster near one or more of IXYS' facilities or those of its major
suppliers could disrupt IXYS' operations and those of its suppliers, which could
in turn limit the supply of IXYS' products and harm its business.

IXYS MAY BE AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

IXYS is subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in the United States
and in Germany related to the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of
certain chemicals and gases used in its manufacturing process. Any of those
regulations could require IXYS to acquire expensive equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with them. If IXYS incurs substantial
additional expenses, product costs could significantly increase. IXYS' failure
to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could
result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations.

IXYS FACES THE RISK OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS ALLEGING
THAT THE USE OF DEVICES THAT INCORPORATE ITS PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ADVERSE
EFFECTS.

Approximately 13% of IXYS' net revenues in fiscal year 2001 were derived from
sales of products used in medical devices such as defibrillators. Product
liability risks may exist even for those medical devices that have received
regulatory approval for commercial sale. IXYS does not currently carry product
liability insurance, and any defects in its products used in these devices could
result in significant recall or product liability costs to IXYS.

ABB AG AND NATHAN ZOMMER OWN A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN IXYS' COMMON STOCK.

ABB AG and Nathan Zommer, Ph.D., IXYS' president and chief executive officer,
beneficially own, as of the record date collectively, approximately 51.2% of
IXYS' shares of common stock, and after the completion of the merger will
beneficially own, collectively, approximately 43.5% of IXYS' shares of common
stock. As a result, ABB AG and Dr. Zommer, acting together, could exercise
significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election of the board of directors. These concentrated holdings could result
in a delay of, or serve as a deterrent to, possible changes in control of IXYS,
which may reduce the market price of its common stock. See "IXYS Principal
Stockholders."

THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF IXYS' AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW MAY DELAY, DEFER OR
PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.

IXYS' board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges
and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further
vote or action by its stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock
will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any
shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of
preferred stock may delay, defer or prevent a change in

control because the terms of any issued preferred stock could potentially
prohibit IXYS' consummation of any merger, reorganization, sale of substantially
all of its assets, liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction,
without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred
stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect
on IXYS' stockholders.

IXYS' stockholders must give substantial advance notice prior to the relevant
meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to its
stockholders at a meeting. These notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by
delaying stockholder action. The Delaware anti-takeover law restricts business
combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of
IXYS' common stock. The Delaware statute makes it more difficult for IXYS to be
acquired without the consent of its board of directors and management.

The following matters, among others, may have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects,
financial or otherwise, of Clare, particularly if Clare's stockholders do not
vote to approve the merger agreement at the special meeting.

RISKS RELATED TO CLARE'S BUSINESS

The following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects,
financial or otherwise, of Clare, particularly if Clare's stockholders do not
vote to approve the merger agreement and approve the merger at the special
meeting.

CLARE HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND ITS OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY
BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND CLARE'S CONTROL.

Clare has experienced net losses since the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999 and
there can be no assurance that Clare will be able to increase net sales or
increase or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

Clare's operating results may fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that
may affect Clare's quarterly and annual results are:

      --   the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers;

      --   fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product
           shipments;

      --   changes in the mix of products that customers purchase;

      --   market acceptance of products;

      --   gain or loss of significant customers;

      --   the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and
           returns;

      --   the timing of product introductions or announcements by Clare or its
           competitors;

      --   fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses;

      --   availability of production capacity;

      --   the availability and cost of products from Clare's suppliers;

      --   changes in product distribution channels and the timeliness of
           receipt of distributor resale information;

      --   difficulties in forecasting demand for products and the planning and
           managing of inventory levels;

      --   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;

      --   fluctuations in the communications industry;

      --   competitive pressures on selling prices;

      --   the amount and timing of investments in research and development; and

      --   severance obligations payable upon termination of some of Clare's
           employees.

As a result of these factors, many of which are difficult to control or predict,
as well as the other risk factors discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Clare may experience material adverse fluctuations in its
future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND AN INDUSTRY DOWNTURN COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

In the past, business conditions in the semiconductor industry have rapidly
changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand. Any future
downturn in the industry could harm Clare's business and cause its operating
results to suffer. The industry is characterized by:

      --   periods of overcapacity and production shortages;

      --   cyclical demand for semiconductors;

      --   changes in product mix in response to changes in demand;

      --   variations in manufacturing costs and yields;

      --   rapid technological change and the introduction of new products;

      --   significant price erosion; and

      --   significant expenditures for capital equipment and product
           development.

THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND AN
INDUSTRY DOWNTURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

The communications industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid
technological change. In addition, the communications industry has undergone
periods of rapid growth, consolidation and corporate restructurings. Although
Clare has expanded its customer base, Clare expects sales to the communications
industry to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales for the
foreseeable future. A decline in the demand for communications-related equipment
such as facsimile machines and modems would cause a decline in demand for
Clare's products and could materially and adversely affect its operating
results.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH CLARE PARTICIPATES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND SUCH
COMPETITION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

The markets in which Clare operates, including the semiconductor and
communications industries, are highly competitive, and Clare faces competition
from a number of different manufacturers in each of its product areas. In
addition, Clare sells products to divisions of companies with which Clare may
also currently compete or may compete in the future. There can be no assurance
that Clare will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing
or potential competitors or that it will not experience additional price
competition, which may adversely affect Clare's results of operations.

Clare's ability to compete successfully in its target markets depends on the
following factors:

      --   product quality, reliability and performance;

      --   product features;

      --   timely delivery of products;

      --   price;

      --   breadth of product line;

      --   design and introduction of new products; and

      --   technical support and service.

In addition, Clare's competitors or customers may offer new products based on
new technologies, industry standards or end user or customer requirements,
including products that have the potential to replace, or provide lower cost or
higher performance alternatives to, Clare's products. The introduction of new
products by Clare's competitors or customers could render Clare's existing and
future products obsolete or unmarketable.

Clare's primary competitors include Matushita, NEC, Solid State Optronics,
Vishay and Silicon Labs. Many of Clare's competitors have greater financial,
technical, marketing and management resources than Clare has. Some of these
competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be
profitable for Clare to sell its products or benefit from established customer
relationships that provide these competitors with a competitive advantage.

CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN
THE U.S. ECONOMY.

Due to the recent decrease in corporate profits, capital spending and consumer
confidence, Clare has recently seen some weakness develop in certain of its end
markets. Clare markets its products to several commercial markets, including the
telecommunications network interfaces, metering and remote access, control
instrumentation and security markets, which have been affected by the recent
slowdown in the U.S. economy. If the economic slowdown continues, Clare's
business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.

CLARE'S CONTINUED UNDER-UTILIZATION OF ITS WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY COULD HAVE
AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CLARE'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

Clare operates a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Beverly, Massachusetts.
To date, demand for semiconductor products has not allowed Clare to fully
utilize the facility and has contributed to a decline in Clare's overall gross
margin rate. In addition, it is not expected that the facility will be fully
utilized in the near term. The continuing lack of effective utilization of
Clare's semiconductor manufacturing facility could have a material adverse
effect on Clare's future operating results.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF CLARE'S BUSINESS AND UNAVAILABILITY
OF CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

The semiconductor industry is capital intensive. Semiconductor manufacturing
requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive, as
new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller,
more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices. Clare maintains certain
of its own manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, which have required and
will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and
equipment. There can be no assurance that Clare will have sufficient capital
resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing, technology and
equipment.

CLARE'S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY
MANUFACTURE COMPLEX PRODUCTS.

In connection with its manufacturing capabilities, Clare relies on technical and
business management personnel, manufacturing staff and other employees to ensure
efficient manufacturing and distribution of products. There can be no assurance
that Clare will be successful in retaining such persons or that it will be able
to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields or ship products on time in the
future. In addition, any prolonged inability to utilize any of Clare's
facilities, or facilities Clare relies on for assembly, as a result of fire,
natural disaster, work stoppage or other event would have a material adverse
effect on Clare's business.

Furthermore, the fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise
process, and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous
die on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of, among other factors:

      --   minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment;

      --   defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer;

      --   manufacturing equipment failure; or

      --   wafer breakage.

For these and other reasons, Clare could experience a decrease in manufacturing
yields. Additionally, as Clare increases its manufacturing output, it may also
experience a decrease in manufacturing yields. As a result, Clare may not be
able to cost effectively expand production capacity in a timely manner.

CLARE'S DEPENDENCE ON INDEPENDENT SUBCONTRACTORS TO ASSEMBLE AND TEST PRODUCTS
SUBJECTS IT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS AND
HIGHER MATERIALS COSTS.

Clare's wafer fabrication facilities design, manufacture, and test chips. All
fabricated chips for discrete components are shipped for assembly to a
subcontractor in the Philippines. Certain assembled relays are returned to Clare
for testing. However, while probe testing of wafers and final product testing
are performed at Clare's California facility, wafer fabrication and assembly
operations for ASIC products are sub-contracted. To the extent Clare depends on
independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of its products, Clare's
reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks:

      --   reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;

      --   potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand;

      --   difficulties in selecting and integrating new subcontractors;

      --   limited warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products
           supplied to Clare;

      --   potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other
           factors; and

      --   potential misappropriation of Clare's intellectual property.

These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs, which may
harm Clare's profitability, operating results and customer relationships.

CLARE RELIES ON A SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES CREATING FIXED COSTS AND
DEPENDENCE ON RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS.

Clare relies on certain suppliers of raw materials and services for supply of
critical items. There can be no assurance that in the future Clare's suppliers
will be able to meet Clare's needs effectively and on a timely basis. Clare's
reliance on a limited number of suppliers also involves other risks, including
reduced control over wafer prices, fixed cost obligations, timely delivery, and
product reliability and quality.

CLARE RELIES ON ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL MANY OF ITS
PRODUCTS.

Clare markets and distributes its products primarily through direct and contract
sales representatives and distributors in North America, Europe, Japan and the
Far East. Clare's distributors are generally permitted to exchange a small
portion of the products purchased by them during the term of their agreements
with Clare and are generally entitled to market and sell competing products.
Clare's sales representatives and distributors can discontinue marketing Clare's
products with minimal notice. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales
volume through, one or more of Clare's sales representatives or distributors
could have a material adverse effect on Clare's operating results.

Clare's distributors and sales representatives may not devote the resources
necessary to sell Clare's products in the volumes and within the time frames
that Clare expects. In addition, Clare depends upon

the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales
representatives, some of which are small organizations with limited working
capital. These distributors and sales representatives, in turn, depend
substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the
semiconductor industry. Clare believes that its success will continue to depend
upon these distributors and sales representatives. If distributors or sales
representatives experience financial difficulties, or otherwise become unable or
unwilling to promote and sell Clare's products, Clare's business could be
harmed.

CLARE'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE IT TO MATERIAL RISKS.

During the nine months period ending December 23, 2001, sales to customers in
Asia and Europe comprised approximately 32% of Clare's net sales. While Clare
has sold certain of its business lines, Clare expects revenues from foreign
markets, including Asia and Europe, to continue to represent a significant
portion of total revenues. Some of the risks inherent in doing business
internationally are:

      --   foreign currency fluctuations;

      --   changes in the laws, regulations or policies of the countries in
           which Clare sells its products;

      --   trade restrictions;

      --   transportation delays;

      --   work stoppages; and

      --   economic or political instability.

In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect Clare's
products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws.
Therefore, the risk of piracy of Clare's technology and products may be greater
when Clare sells its products in these foreign countries.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES COULD RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND A DECREASE
IN DEMAND FOR CLARE'S PRODUCTS, AND CLARE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR
INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS TO SATISFY CHANGES IN DEMAND THEREBY ATTRACTING NEW OR
RETAINING OLD CUSTOMERS.

Clare's failure to develop new technologies or react to changes in existing
technologies could materially delay its development of new products, which could
result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to its competitors.
Rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, along with frequent new
product introductions, characterize the semiconductor industry. Clare's
financial performance depends on its ability to design, develop, manufacture,
assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and
cost-effective basis thereby attracting new or retaining old customers. There
can be no assurance that Clare will successfully identify new product
opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and
cost-effective manner, or that products or technologies developed by others will
not render Clare's products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. In
addition, there can be no assurance that Clare's newly developed technology will
work as planned or be well received by customers. A fundamental shift in
technologies in Clare's product markets could have a material adverse effect on
its competitive position within the industry.

CLARE'S REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON ITS PRODUCTS BEING DESIGNED INTO ITS
CUSTOMERS' PRODUCTS.

Some of Clare's products are incorporated into customers' products or systems at
the design stage. The value of any design win largely depends upon the
commercial success of the customer's product and on the extent to which the
design of the customer's electronic system also accommodates incorporation of
components manufactured by Clare's competitors. In addition, Clare's customers
could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer
require its products. Clare may not achieve design wins or its design wins may
not result in future revenues. Because Clare's products typically have lengthy
sales cycles, Clare may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses
related to research and development associated with such design wins and the
generation of revenues.

CLARE DEPENDS ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A LARGE PORTION OF ITS
BUSINESS, AND CHANGES IN THESE CUSTOMERS' ORDERS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT
ON CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

During the nine months period ending December 23, 2001, Clare's ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 40% of Clare's total net sales. Clare is
highly reliant upon continued revenues from its largest customers and any
material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from these customers could
have a material adverse effect on Clare's future results of operations.

IF CLARE'S CUSTOMERS TERMINATE THEIR EXISTING AGREEMENTS, OR DO NOT ENTER INTO
NEW AGREEMENTS OR SUBMIT ADDITIONAL PURCHASE ORDERS FOR CLARE'S PRODUCTS, ITS
BUSINESS WILL SUFFER.

Most of Clare's sales are made on a purchase order basis as needed by its
customers. In addition, to the extent Clare has agreements in place with its
customers, most of these agreements are either short term in nature or provide
its customers with the ability to terminate the arrangement with minimal prior
notice. Clare will lose business and its revenues will decrease if a significant
number of customers do not submit additional purchase orders, do not enter into
new agreements with Clare, or elect to terminate their relationship with Clare.

In addition, developments adverse to Clare's customers or their products could
have an adverse effect on it. A variety of conditions, both specific to each
individual customer and generally affecting each customer's industry, may cause
such customers to cancel, reduce or delay purchase orders.

CLARE'S BACKLOG MAY NOT RESULT IN FUTURE REVENUES.

Clare's backlog reporting method includes only those purchase orders scheduled
for shipment within 6 months following the order date. Although Clare's contract
terms may vary from customer to customer, purchasers may generally cancel or
reschedule orders without significant penalty. Since backlog can be canceled or
rescheduled, there can be no assurance that Clare's backlog would result in
actual revenues. A reduction of backlog during any particular period, or the
failure of Clare's backlog to result in future revenues, could harm Clare's
operating results.

DETERIORATION OF CLARE'S BRAND RECOGNITION OR LOSS OF REPUTATION MAY ADVERSELY
AFFECT CLARE'S OPERATING RESULTS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS.

Clare capitalizes on its worldwide brand recognition to expand into new
geographic markets and new industries. Clare's products are highly complex and
may contain errors and bugs that Clare is not able to detect before they go to
customers or market. Clare's defective products may lead to loss of its
reputation, deterioration of its brand recognition and a lessening of demand
both in current and prospective customers. As many of these defective products
may be returned for correction or replacement, Clare may have to make
unanticipated capital expenditures in design and manufacture. Clare also may
have to expend considerable time to maintain good, or to repair deteriorating,
customer relations. In addition, Clare may be forced to replace an obsolete and
unusable inventory of products. There can be no assurance that Clare will be
successful in maintaining its brand recognition or in maintaining or repairing
relationships with customers. Deterioration of Clare's brand recognition and
capital expenditures associated with defective products may adversely affect
Clare's operating results and relationship with customers.

CLARE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ADEQUATELY.

The validity and scope of Clare's patents have in the past been challenged by
its competitors. Although Clare enforces and protects its patents, trademarks,
copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, there can be
no assurance that the measures taken by Clare will stop or prevent further
misappropriation of its technology and intellectual property rights. In
addition, litigation Clare undertakes in order to enforce its patents and other
intellectual property rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of
resources. There can be no assurance that Clare's patents will prove to be
enforceable, that any patents will be issued with respect to those for which
applications have been made, or that competitors will not develop functionally
similar devices outside the protection of any patents Clare has or may obtain.

Clare has from time to time received, and may in the future receive,
communication from third parties alleging that certain of its products or
technologies infringe the proprietary rights of such third parties. There can be
no assurance that Clare is not infringing the proprietary rights of any third
party. An intellectual property lawsuit against Clare due to such infringement,
if successful, could subject Clare to significant liability for damages and
could invalidate its proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against Clare
could also force it to cease selling, or redesign, products that incorporate the
infringed intellectual property. In addition, Clare could also be required to
obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the
infringed technology. There can be no assurance that, if Clare is so infringing,
a license to such rights would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if
at all. In the event of any such infringement, Clare's results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

CLARE'S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF ITS MANAGEMENT AND
KEY ENGINEERING PERSONNEL AND ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE AND RETAIN
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL.

Clare's success depends, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities
of its senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of its senior
management or other key employees could adversely affect Clare's business.

In general, there is intense competition for qualified employees in the
semiconductor industry, particularly for highly skilled design, applications and
test engineers. Clare may not be able to continue to attract and retain
engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its
business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could leave
Clare at any time in the future. Clare's anticipated growth is expected to place
increased demands on its resources, and will likely require the addition of new
management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional
expertise by existing management employees. If Clare loses the services of or
fails to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel, its
business could be adversely affected.

CLARE MAY BE AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

Clare and its operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing
federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws
and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions of air
pollutants, discharges of wastewater and storm water and the disposal of solid
and hazardous wastes. Clare is also subject to liability for the investigation
and remediation of environmental contamination (including contamination caused
by other parties) at properties it has previously owned, including its former
facility located on West Pratt Avenue in Chicago, or properties it currently
operates and at other properties where Clare or its predecessors have arranged
for the disposal of hazardous substances. As a result, Clare is involved, from
time to time, in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating
to environmental matters. There can be no assurance that Clare will not be
involved in such proceedings in the future and that the aggregate amount of
future clean-up costs and other environmental liabilities will not have a
material adverse effect on Clare's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Federal, state and local governments could enact laws or regulations concerning
environmental matters that affect Clare's operations or facilities or increase
the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, Clare's
products. Clare cannot predict the environmental liabilities that may result
from legislation or regulations adopted in the future, the effect of which could
be retroactive. Nor can Clare predict how existing or future laws and
regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions
may be found to exist at its facilities or at other properties where Clare or
its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. The
enactment of more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of
existing laws and regulations could require expenditures by Clare, some of which
could have a material adverse effect on Clare's business, financial condition
and operating results.

CLARE FACES THE RISK OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS ALLEGING
THAT THE USE OF DEVICES THAT INCORPORATE ITS PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ADVERSE
EFFECTS.

One or more of Clare's products may be found to be defective after it has
already shipped the products in volume, requiring a product replacement or
recall. Clare may also be subject to product returns that could impose
substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and operating results.

Product liability claims may be asserted with respect to Clare's products.
Although Clare currently have product liability insurance, Clare cannot assure
you that it has obtained sufficient insurance coverage, that it will have
sufficient insurance coverage in the future or that it will have sufficient
resources to satisfy any product liability claims.

CLARE'S STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE.

The market price of Clare's common stock has fluctuated significantly to date.
For example, in the period beginning April 1, 2001 and ending May 13, 2002,
Clare's common stock traded as high as $6.71 per share and as low as $1.55 per
share. The future market price of Clare's common stock may also fluctuate
significantly due to:

      --   variations in actual or expected quarterly operating results;

      --   announcements or introductions of new products;

      --   technological innovations by competitors or development setbacks by
           Clare;

      --   conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets;

      --   the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation;

      --   changes in analysts' estimates of Clare's performance or changes in
           analysts' forecasts regarding Clare's industry, competitors or
           customers; or

      --   general economic and market conditions.

In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology
companies, including semiconductor companies. These fluctuations have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of companies in Clare's
industry, and could harm the market price of its common stock.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS MAY DAMAGE CLARE'S FACILITIES OR THOSE OF ITS SUPPLIERS.

Clare's operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other
natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure and other
events beyond its control. Clare does not have a detailed disaster recovery plan
and does not have backup generators. Its Clare-Micronix facility in California
is located near major earthquake fault lines. California has in the past and may
again in the future experience shortages of electrical power and is subject to
power outages. If power outages occur, Clare's ability to conduct administrative
matters and test its products could be seriously impaired, which could harm its
business, financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance
that the insurance it maintains against general business interruptions will be
adequate to cover all of Clare's losses.

special meeting of IXYS stockholders will be limited to the purpose stated in
the notice accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus. No other purpose
has been stated in the notice accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

RECORD DATE

The IXYS board of directors has fixed Monday, May 13, 2002 as the record date
for determination of IXYS stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting of IXYS stockholders and any adjournment or postponement
thereof. As of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting
of IXYS stockholders, 26,894,223 shares of IXYS common stock were outstanding
and entitled to vote, held by approximately 228 holders of record.

VOTE REQUIRED

Holders of IXYS common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of IXYS
common stock held as of the record date.

IXYS stockholder approval of the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger is
required under the rules of The Nasdaq National Market, on which IXYS' common
stock is listed, because the total number of shares of IXYS common stock to be
issued in the merger and on exercise of the Clare options and purchase rights
assumed in the merger is expected to exceed 20% of the number of shares of IXYS
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger. Approval of the
issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger will require the affirmative vote of
a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock present at the IXYS
special meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote
on this proposal.

As of the record date for the special meeting of IXYS stockholders, the
directors and executive officers of IXYS and their affiliates owned
approximately 7,600,544 shares of IXYS common stock, which represented
approximately 28.3% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting of IXYS stockholders.

Nathan Zommer, president and chief executive officer of IXYS, has entered into a
voting agreement with Clare dated as of April 22, 2002, pursuant to which he has
agreed to vote all shares of IXYS common stock owned by him as of the record
date in favor of the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of IXYS common
stock in the merger. Dr. Zommer has also granted Clare an irrevocable proxy to
vote his shares of IXYS common stock in favor of the proposal to approve the
issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger. Approximately 6,686,310 shares of
IXYS common stock, which represent approximately 24.9% of the outstanding shares
of IXYS common stock as of the record date, are subject to Dr. Zommer's voting
agreement. See "Agreements Related to the Merger -- IXYS Voting Agreement."

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

A majority of the shares of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding on the
record date, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes the required
quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting of IXYS
stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes each will be included in

determining the number of shares present and voting at the special meeting of
IXYS stockholders for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Shares present at the meeting but abstaining from the vote on the proposal to
approve the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger will will have the same
effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted for
any purpose in determining whether this proposal has been approved. The failure
of an IXYS stockholder to return a proxy or to vote in person will have the
effect of a non-vote in regards to this proposal.

Brokers holding shares for beneficial owners cannot vote on the proposal without
the beneficial owners' specific instructions. Accordingly, IXYS stockholders are
encouraged to return the enclosed proxy card marked to indicate their vote as
described in the instructions accompanying the proxy card.

BOARD RECOMMENDATION

The IXYS board of directors has approved the merger agreement, the merger and
the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger and has determined that the
merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the stockholders of IXYS. Therefore, the IXYS board of
directors recommends that IXYS stockholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of
IXYS common stock in the merger.

In considering the board's recommendation, IXYS stockholders should be aware
that some IXYS directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of other IXYS stockholders
generally. See "The Merger -- Interests of IXYS' Executive Officers and
Directors in the Merger."

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

IXYS and Clare will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. IXYS and Clare
will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of IXYS
common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and
will, upon request, reimburse such banks, brokers and other intermediaries for
their reasonable expenses in complying with such requests. Solicitation of
proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile and other electronic

           or

      --   by attending the special meeting of IXYS stockholders and voting in
           person.

Attendance at the special meeting of IXYS stockholders does not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

Even if an IXYS stockholder plans to attend the special meeting in person, IXYS
requests that the stockholder sign and return the enclosed proxy card as
described in the joint proxy statement/prospectus and in accordance with the
instructions accompanying the proxy card, thus ensuring that the shares held by
the stockholder will be represented at the special meeting. If an IXYS
stockholder does attend the special meeting of IXYS stockholders and wishes to
vote in person, he or she may withdraw the proxy and vote in person.

MATTER TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING OF CLARE STOCKHOLDERS

and thereby to approve the merger. No other matters may be brought before the
special meeting of Clare stockholders. Under Clare's by-laws, business
transacted at the special meeting of Clare stockholders will be limited to the
purpose stated in the notice accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
No other purpose has been stated in the notice accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

RECORD DATE

The Clare board of directors has fixed May 14, 2002 as the record date for
determination of Clare stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting of Clare stockholders and any adjournment or postponement
thereof. As of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting
of Clare stockholders, 9,905,361 shares of Clare common stock were outstanding
and entitled to vote, held by approximately 147 holders of record.

VOTE REQUIRED

Holders of Clare common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Clare
common stock held as of the record date.

Approval of the merger agreement and the merger will require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Clare common stock.

As of the record date for the special meeting of Clare stockholders, the
directors and executive officers of Clare and their affiliates owned
approximately 159,679 shares of Clare common stock, which represented
approximately 1.6% of the outstanding shares of Clare common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting of Clare stockholders. Winston R. Hindle, Andrew E.
Lietz, James K. Sims and John G. Turner, each a director of Clare, Larry
Mihalchik, a director and the president and chief executive officer of Clare,
and Harry Andersen, the chief financial officer of Clare, have each entered into
voting agreements with IXYS dated as of April 22, 2002, pursuant to which they
have agreed to vote all shares of Clare common stock owned by them as of the
record date in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Each of
these parties has also granted IXYS an irrevocable proxy to vote his shares of
Clare common stock in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement.
Approximately 152,779 shares of Clare common stock, which represents
approximately 1.5% of the outstanding shares of Clare common stock as of the
record date, are subject to the voting agreements. See "Agreements related to
the Merger -- Clare Voting Agreements."

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

A majority of the shares of Clare common stock issued and outstanding on the
record date, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes the required
quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting of Clare
stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes each will be included in

determining the number of shares present and voting at the special meeting of
Clare stockholders for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Because approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Clare common stock,
broker non-votes and shares abstaining from the vote on the proposal to approve
the merger agreement and the merger will have the same effect as votes against
this proposal. The failure of a Clare stockholder to return a proxy or to vote
in person will have the effect of a vote against this proposal.

Accordingly, Clare stockholders are encouraged to return the enclosed proxy card
marked to indicate their vote as described in the instructions accompanying the
proxy card.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

Clare has retained the services of The Corporate Governance Group of Strategic
Stock Surveillance, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies from Clare
stockholders. The fees to be paid to the firm by Clare for these services are
not expected to exceed approximately $7,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. Clare will bear its own expenses in connection with the solicitation
of proxies for the special meeting of Clare stockholders.

IXYS and Clare will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. IXYS and Clare
will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of IXYS
common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and
will, upon request, reimburse such banks, brokers and other intermediaries for
their reasonable expenses in complying with such requests. Solicitation of
proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile and other electronic
means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or
employees of IXYS and Clare. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees for those solicitation efforts.

agreement and the merger and has determined that the merger agreement and the
merger are fair to, and are in the best interests of, the stockholders of Clare.
Therefore, Clare's board of directors recommends that Clare stockholders vote
FOR the approval of the merger agreement and the merger contemplated thereby.

In considering the board's recommendation, Clare stockholders should be aware
that some Clare directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Clare
stockholders generally. See "The Merger -- Interests of Clare's Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger."

The matter to be considered at the special meeting of Clare stockholders is of
great importance to Clare stockholders. Accordingly, Clare stockholders are

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

At the effective time of the merger, Teacup Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of IXYS, will be merged with and into Clare, with Clare surviving the
merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS. Clare stockholders will receive
shares of IXYS common stock for the shares of Clare common stock they own, and
Clare option holders will receive options to purchase shares of IXYS common
stock for the options to purchase Clare common stock that they hold. IXYS and
Clare are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible, and hope to
complete the merger in the second or early in the third calendar quarter of
2002.

Holders of Clare common stock will receive 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common
stock for each share of Clare common stock that they own. Holders of options to
purchase Clare common stock will receive options to purchase 0.49147 of a share
of IXYS common stock for every share of Clare common stock that they could
purchase under the Clare option, at an exercise price per share equal to the
exercise price of the Clare option divided by 0.49147. IXYS will not issue
fractional shares of common stock in the merger. Instead, each Clare stockholder
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of IXYS common stock will receive cash,
without interest, in lieu of a fraction of a share of IXYS common stock. For a
more detailed description, see "The Merger Agreement -- Manner and Basis of
Converting Shares of Clare Common Stock."

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

In December 2000, Clare engaged Broadview International, LLC to assist Clare in
consideration of strategic alternatives available to Clare, including
acquisition offers and other transactions. In December 2000 and January 2001,
Broadview approached a series of potential strategic and financial buyers across
a variety of market segments to discuss the possible acquisition of
substantially all of the Clare business but did not receive any definitive
expressions of interest in regards to such a transaction. Accordingly, at the
direction of Clare's Board of Directors, between July 2001 and March 2002,
Broadview and Clare's executive officers approached strategic and financial
buyers regarding potential transactions. During this period, Clare received two
indications of interest to purchase the Micronix business, but did not reach
agreement on terms with either interested party.

In mid February 2002, representatives of Trudeau & Trudeau Associates, Inc.,
financial advisor to IXYS, approached Larry Mihalchik, Clare's president and
chief executive officer, regarding a potential merger involving IXYS and Clare.

On March 14, 2002, senior management of Clare and IXYS met at the offices of
Clare's Micronix subsidiary. Messrs. Mihalchik, Andersen, Cocco, Heisig, and Mr.
Van Roosbroeck of Clare made a presentation to Nathan Zommer, IXYS' president
and chief executive officer, and Arnold Agbayani IXYS' senior vice president,
finance and chief financial officer, regarding the business, operations, and
financial performance of Clare. Mr. Kelly of Broadview also attended this
meeting.

On March 16 and 17, 2002, representatives of Broadview and representatives of
Trudeau & Trudeau Associates, Inc. discussed the preliminary terms of a
potential merger involving IXYS and Clare.

On March 19, 2002, Mr. Agbayani forwarded a term sheet to Mr. Mihalchik setting
forth the material terms of a proposed merger involving IXYS and Clare in which
all Clare stockholders would receive $5.00 in shares of IXYS common stock per
share of Clare common stock in a tax-free reorganization. The term sheet also
contemplated that Clare and IXYS would enter into an exclusivity agreement for a
term of thirty days. Following the receipt of the draft term sheet, senior
management of Clare and IXYS, along with their respective legal and financial
advisors, discussed further the terms and structure of the proposed transaction.

On March 21, 2002, Clare's board of directors held a special meeting at which
Mr. Mihalchik informed the board of directors that he had met with Dr. Zommer
and Mr. Agbayani to discuss a potential merger involving IXYS and Clare. At the
meeting of the board of directors, representatives of Broadview presented the
terms of the potential transaction to the directors and provided the board of
directors with a financial overview of IXYS. The board of directors also
discussed the need of Clare to conduct due diligence on IXYS, including on
intellectual property matters and pending litigation. After discussion, the
board of directors authorized Mr. Mihalchik to finalize the proposed term sheet
with IXYS regarding a potential merger and to enter into a thirty day
exclusivity agreement with IXYS. The board of directors also requested that Mr.
Mihalchik report back to them as the potential transaction developed.

During the week of March 25, 2002, Clare and IXYS exchanged due diligence
requests and began conducting legal and financial due diligence on one another.
Representatives of IXYS' financial due diligence consultant, the Transaction
Services Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, met with Mr. Andersen, chief
financial officer of Clare, to conduct financial due diligence.

On March 29, 2002, Mr. Agbayani delivered to the IXYS board of directors a
written summary of the proposed transaction.

During the week of April 1, 2002, representatives from Cooley Godward LLP, legal
counsel to IXYS, conducted due diligence at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP,
legal counsel to Clare. Also during this week, Cooley Godward began providing
documents to Goodwin Procter in response to Goodwin Procter's due diligence
request, and Goodwin Procter began to review these materials. In addition to
this document review, Goodwin Procter also conducted substantive conversations
with patent counsel to IXYS, regarding intellectual property matters and pending
litigation. Cooley Godward and Goodwin Procter continued to conduct their due
diligence through the next three weeks and engaged in numerous conversations
regarding the findings of their analysis.

Also during the week of April 1, 2002, Messrs. Mihalchik and Heisig traveled to
Germany with Dr. Zommer and to the United Kingdom with Mr. Agbayani to tour
IXYS' foreign operations. Members of IXYS' senior management accompanied Messrs.
Mihalchik and Heisig on a tour of IXYS' production facilities and made
presentations regarding IXYS' business, operations, and financial performance.
Management at IXYS' Westcode subsidiary also discussed with Mr. Mihalchik the
recent acquisition of Westcode by IXYS and Westcode's financial performance
following the acquisition. During this same week, Mr. Andersen met with
representatives of the Transaction Services Group of PriceWaterhouseCoopers and
reviewed audit workpapers related to their examination of the accounts of IXYS,
toured IXYS' Santa Clara facility and met with IXYS' operations manager. Also
during this week, Mr. Agbayani visited Clare's Beverly, Massachusetts office and
met with Mr. Andersen to discuss Clare's financial reporting processes and
management information systems and processes.

On April 2, 2002, Cooley Godward provided to Goodwin Proctor an initial draft of
the proposed merger agreement after which Goodwin Procter met with members of
Clare's senior management to discuss the draft.

On April 4, 2002, representatives of IXYS and Clare and their respective legal
and financial advisors commenced negotiations on the terms of the draft merger
agreement. These negotiations focused on all aspects of the draft merger
agreement, including the conditions to each party's obligation to complete the

merger, the events that would give rise to a right of either party to terminate
the merger agreement and the circumstances under which either party would be
required to pay the other in the event the merger agreement was terminated.

On April 5, 2002, Clare's board of directors held a special meeting at which Mr.
Mihalchik updated the board of directors on the status of the proposed IXYS
transaction. Goodwin Procter discussed with the board of directors the terms of
the initial draft merger agreement, as well as the results of its initial due
diligence review. Broadview discussed the structural terms of the merger with
the board, including the magnitude of the proposed termination fee.

During the week of April 8, 2002, the parties continued to conduct due diligence
and negotiate the substantive terms of the merger agreement. On April 10 and 11,
2002, Dr. Zommer visited Clare's facility in Beverly, Massachusetts. Members of
Clare's senior management and technical staff made presentations to Dr. Zommer
regarding Clare's products and operations, and Dr. Zommer toured Clare's wafer
fabrication facility. Dr. Zommer also met with Clare's Chairman, Andrew Leitz.

On April 15, 2002, Clare's board of directors conducted a telephonic meeting.
Mr. Mihalchik updated the board of directors on developments regarding the
proposed IXYS transaction and discussed Dr. Zommer's visit to Clare's plant.
Goodwin Procter discussed progress in negotiations on the definitive merger
agreement and updated the board of directors on its review of IXYS' intellectual
property and pending litigation. Mr. Andersen briefed the board of directors on
the recent increase in trading volume and prices of Clare's common stock,
including the closing price of $5.30 per share on April 12, 2002.

On April 17, 2002, the IXYS board of directors held a special meeting to discuss
the status of the negotiations with Clare and the material terms of the proposed
merger agreement. Members of senior management, along with IXYS' financial
advisor, made a presentation to the board on the strategic rationale for
pursuing the proposed transaction. The board of directors then received
presentations from PricewaterhouseCoopers' Transactions Services Group and
Cooley Godward on the status of the financial and legal due diligence that had
been conducted on Clare to date. Cooley Godward also summarized for the board of
directors the principal terms of the merger agreement and the related ancillary
agreements. The board then discussed the proposed transaction and asked
questions of IXYS senior management regarding Clare and its operations and
technology.

On April 19, 2002, Mr. Mihalchik and Dr. Zommer negotiated the final economic
terms of the merger, including an increase in the price per share to be paid by
IXYS for each share of Clare common stock from $5.00 to $5.50. Following this
discussion, the parties and their respective legal counsel continued to
negotiate the final terms of the merger agreement. Also on April 19, 2002, Clare
extended its exclusivity agreement with IXYS through April 22, 2002.

On April 22, 2002, Clare's board of directors held a special meeting at which
Mr. Mihalchik reviewed the discussions and negotiations with IXYS, as well as
the other strategic alternatives available to Clare. Broadview presented
detailed financial information with respect to the transaction and rendered its
oral opinion that, as of that date, the consideration to be received by Clare's
stockholders under the merger agreement was fair to those stockholders from a
financial point of view. This opinion was later confirmed in writing. Also at
that meeting, Clare's board of directors reviewed with Goodwin Procter the terms
of the merger agreement and the related documentation, as well as the legal
standards applicable to its decision to approve these agreements and the
transactions contemplated by those agreements. After questions by and lengthy
discussion among the members of Clare's board of directors, and after
consideration of the factors described under "Clare's Reasons for the Merger,"
Clare's board of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to recommend to
Clare's stockholders that they vote to approve this member agreement and the
merger.

Also on April 22, 2002, the IXYS board of directors held a special meeting to
review the proposed transaction. Cooley Godward summarized for the board of
directors the material changes to the draft merger agreement that had been made
since the April 17 board meeting. After a discussion of these changes, the IXYS
board of directors voted unanimously to approve the proposed transaction and to

recommend to the stockholders of IXYS that they approve the issuance of IXYS
common stock in the merger. The IXYS board of directors authorized members of
IXYS' senior management to complete negotiations and finalize and execute the
merger agreement and the related agreements. Following the meeting of the board
of directors, Mr. Agbayani contacted Mr. Mihalchik to inform him that IXYS'
board of directors had approved the proposed transaction.

Clare and IXYS entered into the merger agreement late in the evening of April
22, 2002 and publicly announced the merger on April 23, 2002.

IXYS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

In its evaluation of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS'
board of directors reviewed and evaluated a number of factors, including, but
not limited to, the following:

      --   historical information concerning IXYS' and Clare's respective
           business focus, financial performance and condition, operations,
           technology and management;

      --   the view of IXYS' senior management of the financial condition,
           results of operations and business of IXYS and Clare before and after
           giving effect to the merger, and the determination by IXYS' board of
           directors of the merger's effect on stockholder value;

      --   current financial market conditions and historical stock market
           prices, volatility and trading information with respect to IXYS
           common stock and Clare common stock;

      --   the cash position and balance sheet liquidity of IXYS following
           completion of the merger;

      --   the terms of the merger agreement and the belief that the terms of
           the merger agreement, including the parties' representations,
           warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective
           obligations, are reasonable;

      --   the judgment, advice and analysis of IXYS' senior management with
           respect to the potential strategic, financial and operational
           benefits of the merger, based in part on the results of the business,
           technical, financial, accounting and legal due diligence
           investigations of Clare conducted by IXYS' senior management,
           accountants, legal counsel and financial advisor;

      --   the past experience of IXYS' senior management in restoring
           unprofitable wafer fabrication operations to profitability;

      --   presentations by the senior management of Clare to the senior
           management of IXYS; and

      --   meetings between IXYS' senior management team and a number of Clare's
           management, engineering and sales and marketing personnel.

In reaching its determination that the merger was in the best interests of IXYS
and its stockholders, IXYS' board of directors considered, among other things, a
number of the potential benefits of the merger, including the following:

      --   the potential access for IXYS to critical technologies that it would
           otherwise have to develop on its own or acquire from other sources,
           Clare's technical expertise in certain technologies of interest to
           IXYS, a more comprehensive product line and an expanded customer
           base;

      --   the possibility for deeper geographic market and customer penetration
           if the existing customer relationships of the two companies can be
           leveraged for the benefit of the combined organization;

      --   the potential synergies created in combining the research and
           development and technological offerings and strengths of IXYS and
           Clare as well as potential cost reductions created by eliminating
           redundant expenses and operations within Clare and in the combined
           organization;

      --   the possibility of utilizing Clare's foundry and manufacturing
           facilities to reduce IXYS' expenses arising from its current
           outsourcing of these functions; and

      --   the ability of the combined organization to combine the diverse
           technological resources of the two companies to develop new products
           with increased functionality and bring them to market faster than
           either of the companies would likely be able to do on its own.

IXYS' board of directors also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors concerning the merger, including the following:

      --   the possibility that the merger might not be completed in a timely
           manner or at all;

      --   the possibility of difficulties associated with integration of each
           company's products, networks and technologies;

      --   the possibility that IXYS may incur substantial charges late in 2002
           and early in 2003, related to the integration of Clare and IXYS and
           transaction and merger related fees.

      --   the possibility that the merger could have a dilutive effect on IXYS'
           common stock price if revenue and earnings expectations for Clare are
           not met;

      --   the possibility that Clare's operations, which traditionally have
           resulted in a negative net cash flow, could adversely affect IXYS'
           financial results and condition;

      --   the possibility that Clare employees critical to the ongoing success
           of Clare's business and to the successful integration of Clare with
           IXYS could terminate their employment with Clare as a result of the
           merger;

      --   the possibility that IXYS may not be able to utilize Clare's wafer
           fabrication facility efficiently, resulting in continuing negative
           cash flow from that facility;

      --   the possibility of negative effects on each company's operations and
           employee morale by the elimination of redundant expenses and
           capacities after the merger;

      --   the possibility of cultural conflicts between the two organizations;

      --   the possibility that IXYS will have to pay a termination fee to Clare
           in certain situations if the merger is not consummated;

      --   the risks related to Clare's business and how they would affect the
           operations of the combined organization; and

      --   the other risks described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of
           this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

After considering the factors described above as well as other factors, the IXYS
board of directors concluded that, on balance, the potential benefits of the
merger to IXYS and its stockholders outweighed the potentially negative effects
associated with the merger.

This discussion of the information and factors considered by IXYS' board of
directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include all of
the material factors considered by the board of directors. In view of the
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger,
IXYS' board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify
or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination. In addition, the board of directors did not reach a
specific conclusion on any single factor considered, or any aspect of any
particular factor, but rather it conducted an overall analysis of these factors.
Individual members of the board of directors may have given different weight to
different factors.

RECOMMENDATION OF IXYS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS

After careful consideration, IXYS' board of directors has approved the merger
agreement, the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger and
has determined that the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the
merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of IXYS. At
the meeting where these actions were taken, a quorum was present and all
directors voted in favor of

the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger and for the
resolution declaring that the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in
the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of IXYS.

IXYS' board of directors recommends that IXYS stockholders vote FOR approval of
the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger.

In considering the recommendation of IXYS' board of directors with respect to
the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger, IXYS
stockholders should be aware, however, that certain directors and executive
officers of IXYS may have interests in the merger that are different from, or
are in addition to, the interests of IXYS stockholders. See "The
Merger -- Interests of IXYS' Executive Officers and Directors."

CLARE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

Clare's board of directors consulted with members of Clare's senior management,
as well as Clare's legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of
factors, including those listed below, in reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
to recommend that Clare's stockholders vote FOR the adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and the merger.

In particular, Clare's board of directors considered the following factors, all
of which it deemed favorable, in reaching its decision to approve the merger and
the merger agreement:

      --   Review of Strategic Options. Clare's board of directors reviewed the
           strategic options available to Clare, including remaining independent
           and pursuing a revised business model or pursuing other acquisition
           or sale opportunities. In conducting this review, Clare's board of
           directors considered the extensive process conducted by its financial
           advisor, Broadview. The board of directors ultimately determined that
           none of these other strategic options presented superior
           opportunities, or were likely to create greater value for Clare's
           stockholders, than the prospects presented by the merger.

      --   Merger Consideration. Clare's board of directors reviewed the
           financial terms of the merger, including the amount of the merger
           consideration and the fact that the merger consideration represented
           a substantial premium over historic market prices of Clare's common
           stock.

      --   Advice from Financial Advisor. Clare's board of directors considered
           the detailed presentation of its financial advisor, Broadview, with
           respect to the proposed consideration to be received by Clare's
           stockholders in the merger. Clare's board of directors also
           considered Broadview's oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed
           in writing, that the merger consideration is fair, from a financial
           point of view, to Clare's stockholders. The full text of that opinion
           is attached to this document as Annex B.

      --   Tax Treatment. Clare's board of directors considered the fact that
           the receipt by Clare stockholders of shares of IXYS common stock in
           the merger is expected to be tax-free.

      --   Execution Risk. Clare's board of directors considered that, while no
           assurances could be given, the level of execution risk in connection
           with the merger was relatively low given the likelihood of regulatory
           and stockholder approval of the merger.

      --   Effect on Employees. Clare's board of directors considered the
           possible effect of the merger on Clare's employees.

      --   IXYS. Clare's board of directors considered the business, operations,
           financial condition, earnings and prospects of IXYS.

      --   Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement Relating to Alternative
           Transactions. Clare's board of directors also noted the fact that,
           while the merger agreement prohibits Clare from soliciting other
           takeover proposals, Clare may, subject to the satisfaction of certain
           conditions, furnish information

           to a third party and may engage in discussions or negotiations with a
           third party regarding certain takeover proposals. Clare's board of
           directors also considered the fact that Clare could terminate the
           merger agreement under certain circumstances upon the payment of a
           termination fee. Clare's board of directors considered the
           termination fee that would be payable to IXYS in those circumstances
           and concluded that the fee was reasonable and necessary to induce
           IXYS to enter into the merger agreement.

      --   Current Economic Environment. Clare's board of directors also
           considered the recent downturn in economic conditions nationwide and
           the uncertainty in the U.S. economy.

In reaching its determination that the merger agreement is advisable and in the
best interests of Clare and its stockholders, Clare's board of directors
considered, among other things, a number of the potential benefits of the
merger, including the following:

      --   the possibility for deeper geographic market and customer penetration
           if the existing customer relationships of the two companies can be
           leveraged for the benefit of the combined organization;

      --   the potential synergies created in combining the research and
           development and technological offerings and strengths of IXYS and
           Clare as well as the financial condition of IXYS and potential cost
           reductions created by eliminating redundant expenses and operations
           within Clare and in the combined organization;

      --   the possibility of increasing the utilization of Clare's foundry and
           manufacturing facilities; and

      --   the ability of the combined organization to combine the diverse
           technological resources of the two companies to develop new products
           with increased functionality and bring them to market faster than
           either of the companies would likely be able to do on its own.

Clare's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of potential
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, but not
limited to:

      --   the risk to Clare's stockholders that the value of the IXYS common
           stock to be received in the merger could decline significantly from
           that determined as of the date of the signing of the merger
           agreement;

      --   the loss of control over future operations following the merger;

      --   the impact of the loss of Clare's status as an independent company on
           Clare's stockholders, employees and customers;

      --   the risk that the potential benefits to be sought in the merger might
           not be fully realized; and

      --   the possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the
           potential adverse effects of the public announcement of the merger on
           Clare's business, results of operations and prospects.

Clare's board of directors also considered the potential benefits to certain
directors and officers of Clare discussed in the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Interests of Clare's Executive Officers and
Directors in the Merger."

In the opinion of Clare's board of directors, the above factors represent the
material potential adverse consequences that could occur as a result of the
merger. In considering the merger, Clare's board of directors considered the
impact of these factors on Clare's stockholders.

In view of the wide variety of factors it considered, Clare's board of directors
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered. Clare's board of
directors viewed its position and its recommendation as being based on the
totality of the information presented to, and considered by, it. After taking
into consideration all the factors discussed above, Clare's board of directors
determined that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the potential
detriments associated with the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF CLARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

After careful consideration, Clare's board of directors has determined that the
merger agreement is advisable and in the best interests of Clare's stockholders.
Accordingly, Clare's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger and recommends that Clare's stockholders vote FOR the
approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

OPINION OF CLARE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of October 25, 2000, Broadview was
engaged to act as financial advisor to Clare's board of directors. The Clare
board of directors selected Broadview to act as financial advisor based on
Broadview's reputation and experience in the information technology,
communications and media sectors and the semiconductor industry in particular.
In its role as financial advisor, Broadview was requested to render an opinion
to Clare's board of directors regarding the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to holders of Clare common stock of the exchange ratio to be received in
the merger. At the meeting of Clare's board of directors on April 22, 2002,
Broadview delivered its written opinion that, as of April 21, 2002, based upon
and subject to the various factors and assumptions, the exchange ratio, as
calculated on that date, was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of
Clare common stock.

BROADVIEW'S OPINION, WHICH DESCRIBES THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED
AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY BROADVIEW, IS INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE AND ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.
CLARE STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD, READ THE BROADVIEW OPINION
CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE BROADVIEW OPINION IS DIRECTED TO CLARE'S
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO FROM A
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW TO THE HOLDERS OF SHARES OF CLARE COMMON STOCK AS OF THE
DATE OF THE OPINION. THE BROADVIEW OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF
THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY HOLDER OF CLARE
COMMON STOCK AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT THE CLARE SPECIAL MEETING. THE SUMMARY OF THE
BROADVIEW OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, ALTHOUGH
MATERIALLY COMPLETE, IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT
OF THE OPINION.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Broadview, among other things:

- - reviewed the terms of the merger agreement in the form of the draft furnished
  to Clare by IXYS' legal counsel on April 21, 2002;

- - reviewed Clare's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
  31, 2001, including the audited financial statements included in that report,
  and Clare's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31,
  2001, including the unaudited financial statements included in that report;

- - reviewed internal financial and operating information relating to Clare,
  including quarterly and annual projections through March 31, 2003, prepared
  and provided to Broadview by Clare management;

- - participated in discussions with Clare's management concerning the operations,
  business strategy and current financial performance of Clare;

- - discussed with Clare's management its view of the strategic rationale for the
  merger;

- - reviewed the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Clare
  common stock;

- - compared aspects of Clare's financial performance with public companies
  Broadview deemed comparable to Clare;

- - analyzed available information, both public and private, concerning other
  comparable mergers and acquisitions;

- - reviewed IXYS' annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,
  2001, including the audited financial statements included in that report, and
  IXYS' quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2001,
  including the unaudited financial statements included in that report;

- - internally reviewed financial and operating information contained in a CIBC
  World Markets March 4, 2002 equity research report covering IXYS ("CIBC
  report");

- - participated in discussions with IXYS' management concerning the operations,
  business strategy and financial performance of IXYS;

- - discussed with IXYS' management its view of the strategic rationale for the
  merger;

- - reviewed the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for IXYS
  common stock;

- - compared certain aspects of the financial performance of IXYS with public
  companies Broadview deemed comparable;

- - reviewed recent equity research analyst reports covering IXYS;

- - analyzed the anticipated effect of the merger on the future financial
  performance of IXYS;

- - assisted in negotiations and discussions related to the merger among Clare,
  IXYS and their respective financial and legal advisors; and

- - conducted other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Broadview
  deemed appropriate for purposes of its opinion.

In rendering its opinion, Broadview relied, without independent verification, on
the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information that
was publicly available or furnished to Broadview by Clare, IXYS or IXYS'
advisors. Broadview also assumes that neither Clare nor IXYS was involved in any
material transaction as of the date of Broadview's opinion other than the
merger, other publicly announced transactions, and those activities undertaken
in the ordinary course of conducting their respective businesses. Broadview did
not make or obtain an independent appraisal or valuation of any of Clare's
assets.

Broadview's opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic, financial, and
other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of Friday, April 19,
2002, and any change in such conditions would require a reevaluation of
Broadview's opinion. Broadview's opinion did not express any opinion as to the
price at which IXYS common stock will trade at any time.

The following is a brief summary of some of the sources of information and
valuation methodologies employed by Broadview in rendering Broadview's opinion.
These analyses were presented to Clare's Board of Directors board at its meeting
on April 22, 2002. This summary includes the financial analyses used by
Broadview and deemed to be material, but does not purport to be a complete
description of analyses performed by Broadview in arriving at its opinion.
Broadview did not explicitly assign any relative weights to the various factors
of analyses considered. This summary of financial analyses includes information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Broadview, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses.

CLARE STOCK PERFORMANCE ANALYSES

Broadview compared the recent stock performance of Clare with that of the Nasdaq
Composite and the Clare comparable index. The Clare comparable index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to Clare.
Broadview selected companies competing in the discrete/passive communications
component industry and the foundry service industry as Clare comparables. The
Clare comparable index consists of the following companies: Spectrum Control,
Inc., Parlex Corp., RF Monolithics, Inc., IMP, Inc., and Vari-L Company.

PUBLIC COMPANY COMPARABLES ANALYSIS

Broadview considered ratios of equity market capitalization, adjusted for cash
and debt ("total market capitalization") when necessary, to selected historical
and projected operating results in order to derive

multiples placed on a company in a particular market segment. In order to
perform this analysis, Broadview compared financial information of the Clare
comparables index. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview
examined publicly available information, as well as a range of estimates based
on securities research analyst reports.

The following table presents, as of April 19, 2002, the median market
capitalization as multiples of selected operating metrics and the range of those
multiples for the Clare Comparable Index:

                                            MEDIAN MULTIPLE       RANGE OF MULTIPLES
                                          --------------------   --------------------

Total market capitalization/Revenue for
  the last 12 months....................          0.80x             0.32x -  1.37x
Total market capitalization/Last quarter
  annualized revenue....................          1.00x             0.44x -  2.08x
Total market capitalization/Gross profit

Total market capitalization/Last quarter
  annualized gross profit...............          2.65x             0.92x - 25.61x

The following table presents, as of April 19, 2002, the median implied share
values and the range of implied per share values of Clare's common stock,
calculated by using the multiples shown above and the appropriate Clare metric:

                                          IMPLIED MEDIAN VALUE   RANGE OF IMPLIED VALUES
                                          --------------------   -----------------------

Total market capitalization/Revenue for
  the last 12 months....................         $5.75               $3.58 - $ 8.32
Total market capitalization/Last quarter
  annualized revenue....................         $6.52               $4.04 - $11.28
Total market capitalization/Gross profit
  for the last 12 months................         $4.45               $2.63 - $13.30
Total market capitalization/Last quarter
  annualized gross profit...............         $3.37               $2.55 - $14.33

No company utilized in the public company comparables analysis as a comparison
is identical to Clare. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview made numerous
assumptions with respect to the discrete/passive communications component and
foundry service industries' performance and general economic conditions, many of
which are beyond the control of Clare. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the median, average, or range, is not in itself a meaningful method
of using comparable company data.

TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ANALYSIS

Broadview considered ratios of equity purchase price, adjusted for the seller's
cash and debt when appropriate, to selected historical operating metrics to
indicate the value strategic and financial acquirers have been willing to pay
for companies in a particular market segment. A handful of companies involved in
recent transactions are comparable to Clare based on market focus, business
model and size. Broadview reviewed four comparable merger and acquisition
("M&A") transactions from January 1, 2000, through April 19, 2002, involving
sellers in the discrete components industry, excluding equity investments, with
revenue for the last 12 months less than $100 million, from a financial point of
view. Transactions were selected from Broadview's proprietary database of
published and confidential M&A transactions in the information technology,
communications and media industries. These transactions consisted of the
acquisition of:

     1) Compensated Devices Inc. by Microsemi Corp.;

     2) New England Semiconductor Corp. by Microsemi Corp.;

     3) Micro Linear Corp. (power management, bus interface, and video product
        business) by Fairchild Semiconductor; and

     4) Westcode Semiconductor Ltd. by IXYS.

The following table presents the median adjusted price (defined as equity price
plus total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of the seller's
revenue in the last reported twelve months prior to acquisition for the
transactions listed above and the range of those multiples:

                                                              MEDIAN MULTIPLE   RANGE OF MULTIPLES
                                                              ---------------   ------------------

Adjusted Price/Revenue for the last 12 months...............      0.71 x          0.31x - 1.28 x

The following table presents, as of April 19, 2002, the median implied per share
value and the range of implied per share values of Clare, calculated by
multiplying the multiples shown above by the appropriate Clare operating metric
for the twelve months ending December 31, 2001 (in thousands):

                                                                IMPLIED         RANGE OF
                                                              MEDIAN VALUE   IMPLIED VALUES
                                                              ------------   --------------

Adjusted Price/Revenue for the last 12 months...............     $5.33       $3.52 - $7.94

No transaction utilized as a comparable in the transaction comparables analysis
is identical to the merger. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview made
numerous assumptions with respect to the discrete components industry's
performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the
control of Clare and IXYS. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
average, median or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable transaction data.

TRANSACTION PREMIUMS PAID ANALYSIS

Broadview considered premiums paid above the seller's stock price to determine
the additional value strategic and financial acquirers are willing to pay, when
compared to public stockholders, for companies in a particular market segment.
In this analysis, the value of consideration paid in transactions involving
stock is computed using the buyer's last reported closing price (on the
appropriate exchange) prior to announcement. The seller's equity market
capitalization one trading day prior to announcement is calculated using the
seller's last reported closing price (on the appropriate exchange) prior to
announcement. The seller's equity market capitalization twenty trading days
prior to announcement is calculated using the seller's closing price (on the
appropriate exchange) on the first day of that period which consists of twenty
consecutive days during which the appropriate exchange conducts trading
activity, and ends on the day of the last reported closing price prior to
announcement.

Broadview reviewed 24 comparable M&A transactions involving hardware sellers,
excluding equity investments and divestitures, from January 1, 2000 to April 19,
2002 with equity consideration between $20 million and $100 million.
Transactions were selected from Broadview's proprietary database of published
and confidential M&A transactions in the information technology, communications
and media industries. In order of descending premium paid to seller's equity
market capitalization twenty trading days prior to the date of announcement, the
transactions used were the acquisition of:

           1) Autologic Information International, Inc. by AGFA Gevaert NV;
           2) Lowrance Electronics, Inc. by Cobra Electronics Corp.;
           3) Microtest, Inc. by Danaher Corp.;
           4) Labtec, Inc. by Logitech International SA;
           5) Truetime, Inc. by Symmetricom, Inc.;
           6) Equinox Systems, Inc. by Avocent Corp.;
           7) IVI Checkmate Corp. by Ingenico SA;
           8) Fargo Electronics, Inc. by Zebra Technologies Corp.;
           9) DTM Corp. by 3D Systems Corp.;
           10) Encad Inc. by Eastman Kodak Co.;
           11) Netsilicon, Inc. by Digi International Inc.;
           12) Polyvision Corp. by Steelcase, Inc.;
           13) Hello Direct, Inc. by GN Great Nordic A/S;
           14) TCI International, Inc. by SPX Corp.;
           15) Datron Systems, Inc. by Titan Corp.;

           16) ACME Electric Corp. by Key Components LLC;
           17) Elastic Networks Inc. by Paradyne Networks Inc.;
           18) Gatefield Corp. by Actel Corp.;
           19) Zing Technologies by International Rectifier Corp.;
           20) Microwave Power Devices, Inc. by Ericsson;
           21) E.Mergent Inc. by Clearone Communications Inc.;
           22) Barringer Technologies, Inc. by Smiths Group PLC;
           23) Intelispan, Inc. by McLeodUSA Inc.; and
           24) Global Electron Systems by Diebold, Inc.

The following table presents the median premium and the range of premiums for
the above applicable technology hardware premiums:

Technology hardware premium paid to seller's equity market
  capitalization 20 trading days prior to announcement.....      $4.48            $2.16 - $10.51

No transaction utilized as a comparable in the transaction premiums paid
analyses is identical to the merger. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview
made numerous assumptions with respect to the hardware industry's performance
and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Clare
or IXYS. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average, median, or
range is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.

PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED SHARE PRICE ANALYSIS

Broadview calculated the present value of the potential future price of Clare's
common stock on a standalone basis using Clare's management's best estimates
dated April 17, 2002, covering Clare, for the twelve months ending March 31,
2003, discounted to April 19, 2002. The implied share price calculated using the
median total market capitalization to revenue for the last 12 months for the
public company comparables and discounted based on the capital asset pricing
model ("CAPM") using the median capital-structure adjusted beta for the public
company comparables is $5.03. The implied share price calculated using the
median total market capitalization to revenue for the last 12 months for the
public comparables and discounted based on CAPM using Clare's historical beta is
$4.94.

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

Broadview examined the relative contribution of Clare to IXYS for a number of
historical and projected operating metrics. In this analysis, projected figures
for Clare are derived from management's best estimates dated April 17, 2002,
covering Clare and projected figures for IXYS are derived from the CIBC report.

The following table reflects the relative contribution of IXYS and Clare,
respectively:

                                                              IXYS    CLARE
                                                              -----   -----

Revenue for the last 12 months..............................   67.3%  32.7%
Gross profit for the last 12 months.........................   81.8%  18.2%
EBIT for the last 12 months.................................  100.0%    NM
Last quarter annualized revenue.............................   59.1%  40.9%
Last quarter gross profit...................................   80.5%  19.5%
Last quarter annualized EBIT................................  100.0%    NM
Revenue for the 2003 fiscal year............................   67.7%  32.3%
Gross profit for the 2003 fiscal year.......................   82.0%  18.0%
EBIT for the 2003 fiscal year...............................  100.0%    NM

EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS

Broadview considered the relative value public equity markets have placed on
Clare and IXYS common stock from April 19, 2001 through April 19, 2002. For
comparative purposes, the implied historical daily exchange ratio was examined
in contrast with the 0.49147 exchange ratio agreed upon in the merger agreement.
Based on this analysis, the historical exchange ratio has ranged from 0.13847 to
0.54674 with an average of 0.26627.

IXYS STOCK PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Broadview compared the recent stock performance of IXYS with that of the Nasdaq
composite and the IXYS comparable index. The IXYS comparable index is comprised
of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to IXYS. Broadview selected
companies competing in the analog/mixed signal and discrete component industries
as IXYS comparables. The IXYS comparable index consists of the following
companies: Micrel, Inc., Power Integrations, Inc., Pericom Semiconductor Corp.,
Supertex, Inc., Advanced Power Technology, Inc., Microsemi Corp., and Dialog
Semiconductor plc.

EVALUATION OF IXYS EQUITY

Broadview compared financial information of IXYS with publicly available
information for companies comprising the IXYS comparable index. For this
analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available
information, as well as a range of estimates based on securities research
analyst reports.

PRO FORMA COMBINATION ANALYSIS -- Broadview calculated the earnings per share
accretion or dilution of the pro forma combined entity taking into consideration
various financial effects that will result from a consummation of the merger. In
this analysis, projected figures for IXYS are derived from the CIBC report, and
projected figures for Clare are derived from Clare's management's best estimates
as of April 17, 2002. Broadview examined a purchase scenario under the
assumption that no opportunities for cost savings or revenue enhancements exist.
Based on this scenario, the pro forma purchase model indicates a decrease of
$0.23 for earnings per share, excluding acquisition, non-cash, and extraordinary
one-time charges, for fiscal year ending March 31, 2003.

CONSIDERATION OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION METHODOLOGY

While discounted cash flow is a commonly used valuation methodology, Broadview
did not employ such an analysis for the purposes of its opinion. Discounted cash
flow analysis is most appropriate for companies that exhibit relatively steady
or somewhat predictable streams of future cash flow. For a company such as Clare
in a highly cyclical, rapidly evolving industry, a preponderance of the value in
a valuation based on discounted cash flow will be in the terminal value of the
entity, which is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the sustainable
long-term growth rate of the company. Given the uncertainty in estimating both
the future cash flows and a sustainable long-term growth rate for Clare, as well
as the

cyclical nature of Clare chosen market, Broadview considered a discounted cash
flow analysis inappropriate for valuing Clare.

In connection with the review of the merger by Clare's board of directors,
Broadview performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The summary
set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Broadview in connection with the merger.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Broadview considered the results of all of its analyses as a
whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
considered by it. Furthermore, Broadview believes that selecting any portion of
its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view
of the process underlying its opinion.

In performing its analyses, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance and general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Clare or IXYS. The analyses
performed by Broadview are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. The exchange ratio pursuant to the Agreement and other terms
of the Agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between Clare
and IXYS, and were approved by Clare's board of directors. Broadview provided
advice to Clare's board of directors during such negotiations; however,
Broadview did not recommend any specific consideration to Clare's board of
directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the merger. In addition, Broadview's opinion and presentation
to the Clare board was one of many factors taken into consideration by Clare's
board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger. Consequently,
the Broadview analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the opinion of Clare's board of directors with respect to the value of Clare
or of whether Clare's board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different consideration.

Upon consummation of the merger, Clare will be obligated to pay Broadview a
transaction fee equal to 1.75% of the consideration received by Clare
stockholders in the merger, which fee will be no less than $1,000,000. Clare
will also pay Broadview a fairness opinion fee of $500,000. The fairness opinion
fee will be credited against the transaction fee payable by Clare upon
completion of the merger. In addition, Clare has agreed to reimburse Broadview
for its reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of its counsel, and to
indemnify Broadview and its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses
related to their engagement, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with Broadview, which Clare and Broadview
believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's
length between Clare and Broadview, and Clare's board of directors was aware of
the nature of the fee arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion
of the fees payable to Broadview is contingent upon consummation of the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The acquisition will be accounted for as a "purchase" transaction for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. After the merger, the results of
operations of Clare will be included in the consolidated financial statements of
IXYS. The purchase price will be allocated based on the fair values of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Pursuant to Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations," and No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization
over its estimated useful life. Rather, goodwill will be subject to at least
annual assessment for impairment based on a fair value test. Identified
intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized over those lives. A final
determination of the intangible asset values and required purchase accounting
adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, has not
yet been made. IXYS will determine the fair value of assets and liabilities and
will make appropriate business combination accounting adjustments. However, for
purposes of disclosing unaudited pro forma information in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, IXYS has

made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation, based upon
current estimates and assumptions, which is subject to revision upon
consummation of the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger to Clare stockholders, Clare and IXYS. The
discussion is based on existing provisions of the United States Internal Revenue
Code, existing treasury regulations and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change. Any such change, which may or may
not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to IXYS, Clare or Clare
stockholders as described herein.

This discussion does not address all United States federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to Clare stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances. Factors that could alter the tax consequences of the
merger to a Clare stockholder include whether the stockholder:

      --   is a dealer in securities;

      --   is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the United
           States Internal Revenue Code;

      --   is a non-United States person or entity;

      --   is a financial institution, tax-exempt organization or insurance
           company;

      --   acquired Clare shares in connection with stock option or stock
           purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions;

      --   holds Clare shares as part of an integrated investment, including a
           "straddle," consisting of shares of Clare common stock and one or
           more other positions; or

      --   holds Clare shares subject to the constructive sale provisions of
           Section 1259 of the United States Internal Revenue Code.

In addition, this section does not discuss the tax consequences of the merger
under foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of transactions
effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the merger, whether or
not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the merger,
including without limitation any transaction in which Clare shares are acquired
or shares of IXYS common stock are disposed of, or the tax consequences to
holders of options, warrants or similar rights to acquire Clare shares. This
discussion assumes that Clare stockholders hold their shares of Clare common
stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code, which is referred to in this discussion as the Code.

Accordingly, Clare stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors
concerning the specific tax consequences of the merger, including the applicable
federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences to them in the merger.

IXYS and Clare have received opinions from Cooley Godward and Goodwin Procter,
their respective tax counsel, filed as Exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, that the
merger will constitute a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code. These opinions are subject to certain limitations,
qualifications and assumptions, and are based on certain facts and
representations, including factual representations contained in certificates
executed by officers of IXYS and Clare. These representations, if incorrect in
any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached in this
discussion. Neither IXYS nor Clare is currently aware of any facts or
circumstances that would cause such representations and warranties to be untrue
or incorrect in any material respect. These opinions assume the absence of
changes in the relevant facts and law between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger, and assume that the
merger is completed as described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Subject to the conditions and limitations expressed in this discussion, in the
opinion of Cooley Godward and Goodwin Procter, the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the merger
generally will have the following tax consequences to Clare stockholders, Clare
and IXYS:

Clare stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss upon their receipt of
solely IXYS common stock in the merger:

      --   the aggregate tax basis of the IXYS common stock received by a Clare
           stockholder in the merger, including any fractional shares of IXYS
           common stock a Clare stockholder is deemed to receive, will be the
           same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Clare common stock
           surrendered in exchange therefor;

      --   the holding period of the IXYS common stock received by a Clare
           stockholder in the merger will include the period for which the Clare
           common stock surrendered by such stockholder in exchange therefor was
           considered to be held;

      --   any cash payment received by a Clare stockholder for a fractional
           share of IXYS common stock will be treated as if such fractional
           share had been issued in the merger and then redeemed by IXYS.
           Assuming that, immediately after the merger, such stockholder holds a
           minimal interest in IXYS, exercises no control over IXYS and, as a
           result of the deemed redemption and after giving effect to certain
           constructive ownership rules, experiences an actual reduction in
           interest in IXYS, such stockholder will recognize capital gain or
           loss on the deemed redemption in an amount equal to the difference
           between the amount of cash received and the holder's adjusted tax
           basis allocable to such fractional share. Otherwise the cash payment
           may be taxable to the Clare stockholder as a dividend. Any capital
           gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Clare
           stockholder has held the shares of Clare common stock for more than
           one year at the time the merger is completed; and

      --   IXYS and Clare will not recognize gain or loss solely as a result of
           the merger.

Clare stockholders validly exercising dissenters' appraisal rights will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the cash they
receive as a result of exercising these rights and their basis in the shares of
Clare common stock surrendered in exchange. Assuming these shares are held as
capital assets, and provided that the payment is not essentially equivalent to a
dividend within the meaning of Section 302 of the Code, any gain or loss
recognized will be capital gain or loss and, in the case of shares held for more
than one year, the gain, if any, will be long-term capital gain.

Neither IXYS nor Clare will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
in connection with the merger. The tax opinions referred to above do not bind
the Internal Revenue Service and do not prevent the Internal Revenue Service
from asserting a contrary opinion. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully
challenged the status of the merger as a reorganization, Clare stockholders
would recognize taxable gain or loss with respect to each share of Clare common
stock surrendered in the merger equal to the difference between the fair market
value, as of the completion of the merger, of the IXYS common stock received in
the merger and the holders' basis in the shares of Clare common stock exchanged
therefor. In such event, a holder's aggregate basis in the IXYS common stock so
received would equal the fair market value of such stock as of the effective
time of the merger, and the holder's holding period for such stock would begin
the day after the merger.

Each Clare stockholder who receives IXYS common stock in the merger will be
required to file a statement with his, her or its federal income tax return
setting forth the stockholder's basis in the Clare common stock surrendered and
the fair market value of the IXYS stock and cash received in the merger, and to
retain permanent records of these facts relating to the merger.

Unless an exemption applies under applicable law and regulations, the exchange
agent is required to withhold, and will withhold, 30% of any cash payments to a
Clare stockholder in the merger unless the stockholder provides the appropriate
form as described below. Each Clare stockholder should complete and

sign the substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to be
sent to each Clare stockholder, so as to provide the information, including such
stockholder's taxpayer identification number, and certification necessary to
avoid backup withholding, unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in
a manner satisfactory to IXYS and the exchange agent.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of the United States
income tax consequences of the merger and does not purport to be a complete
analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus,
Clare stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the
specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including tax return reporting
requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local,
and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax
laws.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under Section 85 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts General Laws Annotated
("MGLA"), stockholders of Clare who object to the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger may demand payment from the surviving corporation for
their shares based on an appraisal of the value of their shares in accordance
with the provisions of Sections 85 through 98, inclusive, of Chapter 156B of the
MGLA in lieu of accepting the consideration provided for under the merger
agreement.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE TEXT OF THESE PROVISIONS, WHICH IS
ATTACHED TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AT ANNEX C. STOCKHOLDERS
INTENDING TO EXERCISE DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW ANNEX
C. FAILURE TO FOLLOW PRECISELY ANY OF THE STATUTORY PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
ANNEX C MAY RESULT IN A TERMINATION OR WAIVER OF THESE RIGHTS.

In order to exercise the right to demand appraisal and payment of the value of
his or her shares of Clare common stock, a stockholder must:

      --   file with Clare, prior to the vote on the merger agreement, a written
           objection stating that he or she intends to demand payment for his or
           her shares if the merger is consummated; and

      --   not vote his or her shares for approval of the merger agreement.

STOCKHOLDERS MAY FILE WRITTEN OBJECTIONS WITH CLARE AT 78 CHERRY HILL DRIVE,
BEVERLY MASSACHUSETTS 01915, ATTENTION: INVESTOR RELATIONS.

In order not to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, a
stockholder must either:

      --   vote all of his or her shares against approval of the merger
           agreement; or

      --   abstain from voting on the merger agreement with respect to his or
           her shares.

A proxy signed but not marked will, unless revoked, be voted for approval of the
merger agreement and the merger and may result in the loss of dissenters'
appraisal rights.

Within 10 days after the consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation
will notify by registered or certified mail each stockholder who has satisfied
the requirements for demanding the appraisal of his or her shares that the
merger has become effective. The giving of this notice does not create any
rights in the recipient of the notice to demand payment for his or her shares of
Clare common stock.

If, within 20 days after the date such notice is mailed, any stockholder to whom
the surviving corporation was required to give such notice demands in writing
payment from the surviving corporation for his or her shares of Clare common
stock, the surviving corporation will pay to the objecting stockholder the fair
value of his or her Clare common stock within 30 days after the expiration of
the period during which such demand may be made.

STOCKHOLDERS MAY FILE THE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT WITH CLARE AT 78 CHERRY HILL DRIVE,
BEVERLY, MASSACHUSETTS 01915, ATTENTION: INVESTOR RELATIONS.

If during this 30-day period the surviving corporation and the objecting
stockholder are unable to agree on the value of the Clare common stock, either
party may, within four months after the expiration of the 30-day period, demand
a determination of the value of the shares of Clare common stock of all
objecting stockholders by filing a bill in equity in the Superior Court in Essex
County in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any objecting stockholder who
decides to file a bill in equity must do so on his or her own behalf and on
behalf of all other objecting stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom the surviving corporation has not reached an agreement as
to the value of Clare common stock.

Service of the bill must be made upon the surviving corporation by subpoena with
a copy of the bill attached. The surviving corporation will file with its answer
a duly verified list of all objecting stockholders and such objecting
stockholders will be added as parties to the bill. The surviving corporation
will then give notice in such form and returnable on such date as the court will
order to each such stockholder by registered or certified mail to the last known
address as shown in the records of the surviving corporation and by publication
or otherwise as the court may order.

After a hearing, the court will enter a decree determining the fair value of
Clare common stock of those objecting stockholders who have become entitled to
the valuation of and payment for their shares and will order the surviving
corporation to make payment of such value, together with interest, if any, to
the objecting stockholders. The value of those shares will be determined as of
the day preceding the date of the stockholder vote approving the merger
agreement and exclude any element of value arising from the expectation or
accomplishment of the merger.

The costs associated with the bill in equity, excluding fees for counsel and
experts retained by any party, will be taxed upon the parties to the bill as the
court deems equitable. All costs associated with giving notice to stockholders,
however, will be borne by the surviving corporation. Interest will be paid on
any award from the date of the vote approving the merger agreement and the court
may, upon application of any party, determine the amount of interest to be paid.

Any objecting stockholder who has demanded payment for his or her Clare common
stock will not be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting, to vote his
or her stock for any purpose or to receive any dividends or distributions on the
stock (except dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record as of
a date prior to the date of the vote approving the merger agreement) unless:

      --   a bill in equity to determine the fair value of the Clare common
           stock is not filed within the statutory time period;

      --   a bill in equity, if filed, has been dismissed as to such
           stockholder; or

      --   that stockholder has, with the written approval of the surviving
           corporation, delivered a written withdrawal of his or her objections
           and an acceptance of such corporate action.

The enforcement by an objecting stockholder of his or her right to receive
payment for his or her shares in this manner is an exclusive remedy except that
the stockholder may still bring or maintain an appropriate proceeding to obtain
relief on the ground that the corporate action giving rise to such right will be
or is illegal or fraudulent.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES

All shares of IXYS common stock received by Clare stockholders in the merger are
freely transferable, except for shares of IXYS common stock issued to any person
who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Clare under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, at the time the merger is submitted to the Clare stockholders for the
vote. Affiliates may resell shares only in transactions permitted by Rule 145
under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.
Persons who may be affiliates of Clare under the Securities Act generally
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are

under common control with, Clare, and generally would not include stockholders
who are not officers, directors or principal stockholders of Clare.

In connection with the merger, James K. Sims, Winston R. Hindle, Jr., Larry L.
Mihalchik, Andrew E. Lietz, John G. Turner and Harry Andersen, each an affiliate
of Clare, executed affiliate agreements on April 22, 2002. Pursuant to these
affiliate agreements, the affiliates listed above have agreed not to make any
sale, transfer or other disposition of any shares of IXYS stock except in
certain specified situations, including: (a) if the sale, transfer or other
disposition is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act; (b) in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act; (c)
after IXYS receives an opinion from legal counsel that the sale, transfer or
other disposition is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act; or (d) made after the selling stockholder receives a letter from the
Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that the Securities and Exchange
Commission would take no action with respect to the sale, transfer or other
disposition. The affiliate agreements also allow IXYS to place appropriate
legends on the certificates evidencing any IXYS common stock to be received by
these persons or entities, and to issue stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for the IXYS common stock received by the affiliates.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of the IXYS
common stock received in the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.

INTERESTS OF IXYS' EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

When considering the recommendation of the IXYS board of directors, IXYS
stockholders should be aware that Nathan Zommer, the chief executive officer,
president and chairman of the board of directors of IXYS, had interests in the
merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of IXYS
stockholders generally. Specifically, as of April 30, 2002, Dr. Zommer held
6,000 shares of Clare common stock in his individual capacity. Accordingly, as a
holder of Clare common stock, Dr. Zommer will be entitled to vote his shares of
Clare common stock at the special meeting of Clare stockholders and, upon
completion of the merger, Dr. Zommer will receive shares of IXYS common stock in
exchange for the shares of Clare common stock he owns.

INTERESTS OF CLARE'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

When considering the recommendation of the Clare board of directors, Clare
stockholders should be aware that certain directors and officers have interests
in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of the Clare
stockholders generally.

Upon completion of the merger and the issuance of IXYS common stock, based on
the number of shares of common stock of IXYS and Clare outstanding on April 15,
2002, the current directors and executive officers of Clare and their
affiliates, along with those individuals who were directors and officers of
Clare since the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 but who no
longer serve in that capacity, will beneficially own 1.1% of the outstanding
shares of IXYS common stock, calculated on the basis set forth under the heading
"Clare Principal Stockholders."

As of March 31, 2002, the executive officers of Clare held outstanding stock
options to purchase an aggregate of 405,177 shares of Clare common stock. Under
Clare's 1995 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, all outstanding, unvested options
or other awards, including all options and awards granted to the directors and
executive officers of Clare, will become fully exercisable on the occurrence of
a change in control of Clare. In addition, upon a change in control of Clare,
outstanding awards under Clare's Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan granted to Mr.
Dennis Cocco will become fully vested. For purposes of both the 1995 Stock
Option and Incentive Plan and Clare's Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the
merger will constitute a change in control of Clare. See "The Merger
Agreement -- Clare Options" for a description of the treatment of outstanding
Clare common stock options upon completion of the merger.

In connection with the merger, Larry Mihalchik, the president and chief
executive officer of Clare, will become a member of IXYS' board of directors.
Clare has agreed to retain Mr. Mihalchik in his capacity as president and chief
executive officer of Clare for 90 days following the closing of the merger,
after which Mr. Mihalchik's employment with Clare will be terminated. Under the
provisions of Mr. Mihalchik's employment agreement with Clare, this termination
will trigger a cash severance payment to Mr. Mihalchik of 2.99 times his current
annual salary subject to reduction in accordance with Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, IXYS has agreed to pay Mr. Mihalchik
$275,000 upon completion of the merger as consideration for his agreement not to
compete with the business of the combined organization for three years following
the termination of his employment.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of the directors and officers of Clare as of the date of the merger
agreement for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the date of the merger
agreement, as provided in Clare's bylaws, will survive the merger and will be
observed by the surviving corporation to the fullest extent permitted by
Massachusetts law for a period of six years.

In addition, for three years after the merger, the surviving corporation will
maintain in effect, for the benefit of the directors and officers of Clare, the
existing policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Clare as of the date of the merger agreement, provided that (i) the surviving
corporation may substitute for the existing policy a policy or policies of
comparable coverage, and (ii) the surviving corporation will not be required to
pay annual premiums in excess of $292,500 in the aggregate.

Under the terms of the stock transfer restriction agreements signed by each of
the directors and executive officers of Clare, Clare's directors and executive
officers may not transfer for 90 days after the completion of the merger the
shares of IXYS common stock they receive in the merger in exchange for their
shares of Clare common stock. See "Agreements Related to the Merger" for a more
detailed description of the provisions of these agreements.

Additionally, the board of directors of Clare approved an aggregate $150,000
bonus pool to be paid to officers of Clare, other than Mr. Mihalchik,
immediately prior to consummation of the merger.

As a result of the foregoing, the directors and executive officers of Clare may
be more likely to vote for the approval of the merger agreement than Clare
stockholders generally.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF IXYS COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE
MERGER

It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of IXYS common
stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on The Nasdaq National
Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF CLARE COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

If the merger is completed, Clare common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq
National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus is a summary of the
material terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this document. The following description does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement. You should
refer to the full text of the merger agreement for details of the merger and the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

GENERAL

At the effective time of the merger, Teacup Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of IXYS, will merge with and into Clare. Upon completion of the
merger, Clare will continue as the surviving corporation and will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS.

EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER

The completion of the merger will take place no later than the fifth business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger set forth
in the merger agreement. As soon as practicable after the completion of the
merger, Teacup Acquisition Corp. and Clare will file articles of merger with the
Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The merger will become effective
upon the filing of the articles of merger with the Secretary of the
Commonwealth. It is anticipated that the effective time of the merger will occur
as soon as practicable following the special meetings of the IXYS stockholders
and the Clare stockholders. IXYS and Clare are working to complete the merger as
quickly as possible and hope to complete the merger late in the second or early
in the third calendar quarter of 2002.

MANNER AND BASIS OF CONVERTING SHARES OF CLARE COMMON STOCK

The merger agreement provides that, as of the effective time of the merger, each
share of Clare common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
completion of the merger, other than any dissenting shares and shares of Clare
capital stock held by Clare or Clare's wholly-owned subsidiaries or by IXYS,
Teacup Acquisition Corp. or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of IXYS, will be
converted automatically into the right to receive 0.49147 of a share of IXYS
common stock, plus cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share, and any
remaining shares then outstanding will be retired and cancelled, after giving
effect to any properly perfected dissenters' rights of appraisal. The exchange
ratio will be adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
consolidation of shares, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar change with respect to IXYS common stock or Clare common stock,
occurring after the date of the merger agreement and before the completion of
the merger.

Based on the exchange ratio of 0.49147 of a share of IXYS common stock to be
issued for each outstanding share of Clare common stock and the number of shares
of Clare common stock outstanding on the date of the merger agreement, a total
of approximately 5.91 million shares of IXYS common stock will be issued in the
merger, assuming the issuance of approximately 1.04 million shares of IXYS
common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options to purchase Clare
common stock and stock purchase rights.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

No fractional shares of IXYS common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead,
each Clare stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share will receive a
cash amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, without interest, determined by
multiplying that fraction by the closing price of IXYS common stock on The
Nasdaq National Market on the date of completion of the merger. Cash payable to
Clare stockholders in connection with fractional shares may be subject to
withholding for applicable taxes in some circumstances.

EXCHANGE OF CLARE STOCK CERTIFICATES

Following the effective time of the merger, Mellon Investor Services, which has
been selected by IXYS to act as exchange agent in the merger, will mail to each
record holder of Clare common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for
use specifying other details of the exchange. The record holders will use the
letter of transmittal to exchange Clare stock certificates for the shares of
IXYS common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of IXYS common stock to
which the record holders of Clare common stock are entitled to receive in
connection with the merger.

Clare stockholders should not forward Clare stock certificates to the exchange
agent until they have received letters of transmittal from the exchange agent
following the completion of the merger. Clare stockholders should not return
their Clare stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

After the effective time of the merger, transfers of Clare common stock will not
be registered on the stock transfer records of Clare, and each certificate that
previously evidenced Clare common stock will be deemed to evidence the right to
receive the shares of IXYS common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
IXYS common stock to which the record holders of Clare common stock are entitled
to receive in connection with the merger. IXYS will not pay dividends or other
distributions on any shares of IXYS common stock to be issued to the holder of
any Clare stock certificate that is not surrendered until the Clare stock
certificate is surrendered as provided in the merger agreement. No interest will
be payable on the cash to be paid to Clare stockholders in lieu of the issuance
of fractional shares of IXYS common stock. Any claim for IXYS common stock made
by Clare stockholders who have failed to surrender their stock certificates
within 180 days after the effective time of the merger may only be brought
against IXYS.

If any certificate representing shares of Clare common stock is lost, stolen or
destroyed, a Clare stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that
fact to IXYS. IXYS may also require the Clare stockholder to deliver a bond as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against or Clare with respect to
any certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Only upon
receipt of the affidavit, and bond, if requested, will IXYS' exchange agent
issue the shares of IXYS common stock, any cash payable for fractional shares,
and any dividends or distributions that have become payable between the
effective time of the merger and the time of surrender.

CLARE OPTIONS

At the effective time of the merger, IXYS will assume each outstanding option to
purchase Clare common stock, whether or not exercisable at the effective time of
the merger. Each Clare option will continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Clare stock option plan under which that
option was granted, including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions. In
addition, each Clare option will continue to be subject to the terms and
conditions of any applicable stock option agreement that governed that Clare
option immediately prior to the completion of the merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Clare option will be subject to the following two adjustments as
a result of the merger:

      --   each assumed Clare option will be exercisable, or will become
           exercisable in accordance with its terms, for that number of whole
           shares of IXYS common stock equal to the product of (1) the number of
           shares of Clare common stock that were issuable upon exercise of that
           option immediately prior to the completion of the merger, multiplied
           by (2) 0.49147, the exchange ratio applicable to the conversion of
           shares of Clare common stock in connection with the merger, rounded
           down to the nearest whole number of shares of IXYS common stock; and

      --   the per share exercise price for the shares of IXYS common stock
           issuable upon exercise of each assumed Clare option will be equal to
           the quotient determined by dividing (1) the exercise price per share
           of Clare common stock at which price that option was exercisable
           immediately prior to the completion of the merger by (2) 0.49147, the
           same exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

      --   provide the other party with prompt notice of the discovery that any
           representation or warranty made by the notifying party contained in
           the merger agreement was materially inaccurate at the time of signing
           of the merger agreement, or the occurrence of any event, condition,
           fact or circumstance that would cause any representation or warranty

           the notifying party under the merger agreement, or any inquiry or

           regarding the facilities, business or operations of or otherwise
           relating to the notifying party or any event condition, fact or
           circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the
           conditions to completion of the merger impossible or unlikely or that
           could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
           notifying company;

           provisions provided by Clare's by-laws to each of its directors and
           officers for six years and will maintain Clare's current directors'
           and officers' liability insurance, or a similar policy providing
           equal coverage whose premium costs up to $292,500 per year, for
           Clare's directors and officers for three years;

      --   IXYS will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
           IXYS common stock issued in the merger to be approved for listing on
           The Nasdaq National Market; and

      --   upon completion of the merger, IXYS' board of directors will consist
           of seven directors, six of whom will be the current directors of
           IXYS, with the seventh being Larry Mihalchik, the current president
           and chief executive officer of Clare.

RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION OF ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION PROPOSALS BY CLARE

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Clare has agreed that it will not
authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any officer, director, investment
banker, attorney or other advisor of Clare or any of its subsidiaries to, and
will use its reasonable efforts to cause the employees and agents of Clare and
each of its subsidiaries not to:

      --   solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making,
           submission or announcement of any "company acquisition proposal," as
           that term is defined below, or take any action that could reasonably
           be expected to lead to a company acquisition proposal;

      --   furnish to any third party any nonpublic information regarding Clare
           or any of its subsidiaries in connection with or in response to a
           company acquisition proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest
           could reasonably be expected to lead to a company acquisition
           proposal;

      --   engage in discussions with any person with respect to any company
           acquisition proposal;

      --   approve, endorse or recommend any company acquisition proposal;

      --   amend or grant any waiver or release under, or approve any
           transaction or redeem any rights under, Clare's stockholder rights
           agreement or approve any transaction under certain of the
           Massachusetts antitakeover laws;

      --   approve, agree to or recommend any company acquisition proposal; or

      --   enter into any letter of intent or similar document or contract
           contemplating or otherwise relating to any "company acquisition
           transaction," as that term is defined below.

Prior to the stockholder vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement at
the special meeting of Clare stockholders, however, Clare is not prohibited from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding Clare or its subsidiaries to, or
entering into discussions with, any third party in response to a "company
superior offer," as that term is defined below, that is submitted to Clare by a
third party and has not been withdrawn if:

      --   neither Clare nor any of its or its subsidiaries' representatives has
           breached any of the restrictions on solicitation of company
           acquisition proposals contained in the merger agreement;

      --   Clare's board of directors concludes in good faith, after taking into
           account the advice of its outside legal counsel, that furnishing
           nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions with, the
           third party is required for the board of directors to comply with its
           fiduciary obligations to Clare's stockholders;

      --   at least one business day prior to furnishing any nonpublic
           information to, or entering into discussions with, the third party,
           Clare gives IXYS written notice of the identity of the third party
           and of Clare's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or
           enter into discussions with, the third party, and Clare receives from
           the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing
           provisions at least as favorable to Clare as the non-disclosure
           agreement entered into by Clare and IXYS; and

      --   at least one business day prior to furnishing the nonpublic
           information to the third party, Clare furnishes the same information
           to IXYS, to the extent that IXYS has not previously received the
           information.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, if Clare receives a company acquisition
proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a company acquisition proposal or any request for nonpublic
information, then within 24 hours, Clare must provide IXYS with oral and written
notice of the terms of the company acquisition proposal, request for nonpublic
information, inquiry or indication of interest and the identity of the person or
group making the company acquisition proposal, request, inquiry or indication of
interest.

The merger agreement also requires Clare to terminate any existing discussions
that relate to any company acquisition proposal and not to release or permit the
release of any party from, or waive or permit the waiver of, any provision of
any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which Clare or any of
its subsidiaries is a party.

For purposes of these non-solicitation provisions, the merger agreement defines
a "company acquisition proposal" as any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication
of interest, other than from IXYS, contemplating or relating to any "company
acquisition transaction," which is defined as any transaction or series of
transactions involving:

      --   any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
           combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities,
           tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction in which
           Clare or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or in which any person
           or group of persons acquires beneficial or record ownership of
           securities representing more than a 20% interest in any outstanding
           class of voting securities of Clare or any of its subsidiaries, or in
           which Clare or any of its subsidiaries issues more than 20% of any
           outstanding class of its respective voting securities;

      --   any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or
           disposition of any business or businesses or assets that constitute
           or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
           income or assets of Clare or any of its subsidiaries; or

      --   any liquidation or dissolution of Clare or any of its subsidiaries.

The merger agreement defines a "company superior offer" as an unsolicited, bona
fide written offer made by a third party to acquire:

      --   all of the outstanding shares of Clare's common stock by way of
           merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, acquisition,
           business combination or otherwise; or

      --   any business or businesses or assets that constitute or account for
           no less than 50% of the consolidated net revenues of Clare and its
           subsidiaries by way of any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license
           or otherwise,

in either case, on terms that Clare's board of directors determines, in its
reasonable judgment, based on a written opinion of an independent financial
advisor, to be more favorable to Clare's stockholders than the terms of the
merger.

No offer will be considered a company superior offer, however, if any financing
required to consummate the transaction proposed in the offer is not committed
and is not reasonably capable of being obtained by the third party making the
offer or if the offer is conditioned upon completion of due diligence.

CLARE'S SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETING AND THE OBLIGATION OF CLARE'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER

The merger agreement provides that:

      --   Clare must take all action necessary under any legal requirements and
           its charter documents to call, give notice of and hold a special
           meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposal to approve the
           merger agreement discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
           with the meeting to be held as promptly as practicable after the
           effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
           statement/prospectus is a part;

      --   Clare must ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
           special meeting of Clare stockholders are solicited in compliance
           with all applicable legal requirements;

      --   this joint proxy statement/prospectus must include a statement to the
           effect that Clare's board of directors recommends that Clare
           stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement at
           the special meeting of Clare stockholders;

      --   except as described below, neither Clare's board of directors nor any
           committee of Clare's board of directors may withdraw or modify, or
           propose or adopt any resolution to withdraw or modify, in a manner
           adverse to IXYS, the recommendation of Clare's board of directors
           that Clare stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger
           agreement; and

      --   the obligation of Clare to call and hold the special meeting of Clare
           stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement will not be
           limited or affected by the disclosure, announcement or submission of
           a company superior offer or other company acquisition proposal, or by
           any withdrawal or modification of the recommendation by Clare's board
           of directors that Clare stockholders vote in favor of the approval of
           the merger agreement.

Prior to the approval of the merger agreement by Clare stockholders, the
recommendation from Clare's board that Clare stockholders vote in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement may be withdrawn or modified in a manner that
is adverse to IXYS if:

      --   an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to purchase all of the
           outstanding shares of Clare common stock is made to Clare and is not
           withdrawn;

      --   Clare provides IXYS with at least one business day prior notice of
           any meeting of Clare's board of directors at which the board of
           directors will consider and determine whether that offer is a company
           superior offer;

      --   Clare's board of directors determines in good faith, based upon the
           advice of an independent financial advisor, that the offer is a
           company superior offer;

      --   Clare's board of directors determines in good faith, after having
           taken into account the advice of Clare's outside legal counsel, that,
           in light of the company superior offer, the withdrawal or
           modification of Clare's board of director's recommendation that Clare
           stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement is
           required for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
           obligations to Clare's stockholders;

      --   the board of directors' recommendation is not withdrawn or modified
           in a manner adverse to IXYS for at least one business day after IXYS
           receives written notice from Clare confirming that Clare's board of
           directors has determined that the offer is a company superior offer;
           and

      --   neither Clare nor any of its representatives has breached any of the
           provisions regarding solicitation of a company acquisition proposal
           described above.

IXYS' SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETING AND OBLIGATION OF IXYS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO
RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF IXYS COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER

The merger agreement also provides that:

      --   IXYS must take all action necessary under any legal requirements and
           its charter documents to call, give notice of and hold a special
           meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposal to approve the
           issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger discussed in this joint
           proxy statement/prospectus, with the meeting to be held as promptly
           as practicable after the effectiveness of the registration statement
           of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part;

      --   IXYS must ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
           special meeting of the IXYS stockholders are solicited in compliance
           with all applicable legal requirements;

      --   this joint proxy statement/prospectus must include a statement to the
           effect that the IXYS board of directors recommends that IXYS
           stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of IXYS common stock in
           the merger;

      --   except as described below, neither IXYS' board of directors nor any
           committee of IXYS' board of directors may withdraw or modify, or
           propose or adopt any resolution to withdraw or modify in a manner
           adverse to Clare, the recommendation of IXYS' board of directors that
           IXYS stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of IXYS common stock
           in the merger; and

      --   the obligation of IXYS to call and hold the special meeting of IXYS
           stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement will not be
           limited or affected by any withdrawal or modification of the
           recommendation by IXYS' board of directors that the IXYS stockholders
           vote in favor of approval of the issuance of IXYS common stock in the
           merger.

Prior to the approval by IXYS' stockholders of the issuance of IXYS common stock
in the merger, the recommendation of IXYS' board of directors that the IXYS
stockholders vote in favor of approval of the issuance of IXYS common stock in
the merger may be withdrawn or modified, however, if IXYS' board of directors
concludes in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the recommendation
would create a substantial risk of liability for breach of the IXYS board of
directors' fiduciary obligations to IXYS' stockholders.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

           not constitute, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a
           material adverse effect on IXYS and its subsidiaries, taken as a

           affiliate agreement.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The merger agreement provides that IXYS and Clare may agree by mutual written
consent to terminate the merger agreement at any time before the completion of
the merger. In addition, either IXYS or Clare may terminate the merger agreement
at any time before the completion of the merger if:

      --   the merger has not been completed by October 31, 2002, provided that
           the right to terminate the merger agreement for this reason will not
           be available to either IXYS or Clare, as applicable, if the failure
           to consummate the merger by that time is attributable to a failure of
           that party to perform any of its covenants in the merger agreement;

      --   a governmental entity has issued a final and nonappealable order,
           decree or ruling or taken any other action having the effect of
           permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
           merger;

      --   the IXYS stockholders vote and fail to approve the issuance of IXYS
           common stock in the merger, or the Clare stockholders vote and fail
           to approve the merger agreement, provided that the right to terminate
           the merger agreement for this reason will not be available to either
           IXYS or Clare if the failure of that party to perform any of its
           respective covenants in the merger agreement has caused the failure
           to obtain such approval or approvals; or

      --   the representations and warranties of the other party in the merger
           agreement were inaccurate at the time of signing of the merger
           agreement or become inaccurate or the other party breaches its
           covenants, so that the conditions to the obligation of the
           non-breaching party to complete the merger relating to the
           representations and warranties and covenants of the other party would
           not be satisfied, and the inaccuracy or breach is either not curable
           or not cured within 20 days following delivery by the non-breaching
           party of a written notice of the breach.

The merger agreement further provides that IXYS may terminate the merger
agreement at any time before the completion of the merger if any of the
following "company triggering events" occur:

      --   Clare's board of directors fails to recommend that Clare's
           stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement, or withdraws or
           modifies, in a manner adverse to IXYS, the board of directors'
           recommendation that the Clare stockholders vote to approve the merger
           agreement;

      --   Clare fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
           recommendation from Clare's board of directors that Clare's
           stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement;

      --   Clare's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation that
           Clare's stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement within five
           business days after IXYS requests in writing that the recommendation
           be reaffirmed;

      --   Clare's board of directors approves, endorses or recommends any
           company acquisition proposal;

      --   Clare enters into a letter of intent or similar document or contract
           relating to a company acquisition proposal;

      --   a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Clare has been
           commenced, and Clare does not send to its stockholders, within ten
           business days after the commencement of the tender or exchange offer,
           a statement disclosing that Clare recommends rejection of the tender
           or exchange offer; or

      --   Clare or any of its subsidiaries, or any representative of Clare or
           any of its subsidiaries, breaches or takes any action inconsistent
           with any of the provisions described above under the headings
           "Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Proposals by
           Clare" or "Clare's Special Stockholder Meeting and the Obligation of
           Clare's Board of Directors to Recommend Approval of the Merger
           Agreement and Approval of the Merger."

The merger agreement further provides that Clare may terminate the merger
agreement at any time before the completion of the merger if any of the
following "parent triggering events" occur:

      --   IXYS' board of directors fails to recommend that IXYS' stockholders
           vote to approve the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger, or
           withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Clare, the board of
           directors' recommendation that the IXYS stockholders vote to approve
           the issuance of IXYS common stock in the merger;

      --   IXYS fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
           recommendation from IXYS' board of directors that the IXYS
           stockholders vote to approve the issuance of IXYS common stock in the
           merger;

      --   IXYS' board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation that
           the IXYS stockholders vote to approve the issuance of IXYS common
           stock in the merger within five business days after Clare requests in
           writing that the recommendation be reaffirmed;

      --   IXYS' board of directors approves, endorses or recommends a parent
           acquisition proposal;

      --   IXYS enters into a letter of intent or similar document or agreement
           relating to a parent acquisition proposal;

      --   a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of IXYS has
           commenced and IXYS does not send to its stockholders, within ten
           business days after the commencement of the tender or exchange offer,
           a statement disclosing that IXYS recommends rejection of the tender
           or exchange offer; or

      --   IXYS or any of its subsidiaries, or any representatives of IXYS or
           any of its subsidiaries, breaches or takes any action inconsistent
           with any of the provisions described above under the heading "IXYS'
           Special Stockholder Meeting and Obligation of the IXYS Board of
           Directors to Recommend Approval of the Merger and the Issuance of

           income or assets of IXYS; or

      --   any liquidation or dissolution of IXYS.

           is terminated, a company acquisition transaction is consummated.

IXYS and Clare may amend the merger agreement, by action taken or authorized by
their boards of directors, at any time, whether before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the merger to the stockholders of IXYS and
Clare. No amendment may be made, however, without the approval of the
stockholders of IXYS or the stockholders of Clare after the approval by such
stockholders of the matters presented in connection with the merger if
applicable law or the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by such stockholders.

DEFINITION OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

For purposes of the merger agreement, an event, violation, inaccuracy,
circumstance or other matter will be deemed to have a "material adverse effect"
on Clare or its subsidiaries if the event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance
or other matter had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on:

      --   the business, condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities,
           operations, or financial performance of Clare or its subsidiaries,
           taken as a whole;

      --   the ability of Clare to consummate the merger or any of the other
           transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform any
           of its obligations under the merger agreement; or

      --   IXYS' ability to vote, receive dividends with respect to or exercise
           other ownership rights with respect to the stock of Clare.

However, neither of the following will constitute, in and of itself, a material
adverse effect on Clare or its subsidiaries:

      --   any adverse effect that results from general economic or business
           conditions or conditions in the industry in which Clare or its
           subsidiaries operate, as long as the conditions do not
           disproportionately affect Clare or its subsidiaries; or

      --   a decline in Clare's stock price.

A material adverse effect on Clare and its subsidiaries will also be deemed to
have occurred if the consolidated condensed stockholders' equity of Clare on any
given date is less than $38,000,000, exclusive of certain fees and expenses
related to the merger and costs incurred by Clare or its subsidiaries that are
related to actions taken by Clare or its subsidiaries with the written consent
of IXYS.

For purposes of the merger agreement, an event, violation, inaccuracy,
circumstance or other matter will be deemed to have a material adverse effect on
IXYS if the event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or other matter had or
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

      --   the business, condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities,
           operations or financial performance of the IXYS and its subsidiaries,
           taken as a whole; or

      --   IXYS' ability to consummate the merger or any of the other
           transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform any
           of its obligations under the merger agreement.

However, neither of the following will constitute, in and of itself, a material
adverse effect on IXYS:

      --   any adverse effect that results from general economic or business
           conditions or conditions in the industry in which IXYS and its
           subsidiaries operate, as long as the conditions do not
           disproportionately affect IXYS or its subsidiaries; and

      --   a decline in IXYS' stock price.

                        AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER

The following is a summary of the material terms of the voting and stock
transfer restriction agreements that were entered into in connection with, and
related to, the merger agreement. This summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the agreements discussed below that are attached as Annexes to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the agreements in
their entirety.

CLARE VOTING AGREEMENTS

In connection with the merger, the Clare stockholders identified below entered
into voting agreements in favor of IXYS pursuant to which these Clare
stockholders agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Clare common
stock in favor of the merger.

The following description describes the material terms of these voting
agreements. The form of the Clare voting agreement is attached as Annex D to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference.
You are encouraged to read carefully the entire form of the Clare voting

As of the record date, the stockholders of Clare who have entered into the Clare

Winston R. Hindle, Andrew E. Lietz, James K. Sims and John G. Turner, each a
director of Clare, Larry Mihalchik, a director and the president and chief
executive officer of Clare, and Harry Andersen, the chief financial officer of
Clare, have each entered into a Clare voting agreement with IXYS dated as of
April 22, 2002.

Pursuant to the terms of the Clare voting agreements, during the period from
April 22, 2002, through the termination of the Clare voting agreement, each
stockholder of Clare who has entered into a Clare voting agreement has agreed to
vote the shares of Clare common stock owned by that stockholder: (a) in favor of
the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and each of the other
actions contemplated by the merger agreement and any action in furtherance of
any of the foregoing; (b) against any action or agreement that would result in a
breach of any of Clare's representations, warranties, covenants or obligations
under the merger agreement; and (c) against (1) any extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination

or adversely affect the merger or any of the transactions contemplated in the
merger agreement.

Moreover, in the event an "identified termination" occurs prior to the
termination of the Clare voting agreements, each stockholder of Clare who has
entered into a voting agreement has agreed to vote the shares of Clare common
stock owned by that stockholder against any company acquisition proposal or
related transaction or agreement and against any action that is intended or
could reasonably be expected to facilitate the consummation of any company
acquisition transaction. For purposes of the Clare voting agreements, an
"identified termination" means the termination of the merger agreement pursuant
to section 8.1(b) or section 8.1(d) of the merger agreement at any time after a
company acquisition proposal has been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted
or made or the termination of the merger agreement by IXYS pursuant to section
8.1(f) of the of the merger agreement.

The voting obligations under the Clare voting agreements terminate upon the
earlier to occur of the completion of the merger or the date the merger
agreement is validly terminated; however, if an identified

termination occurs, then the voting obligations will terminate 180 days after
the termination of the merger agreement.

These Clare stockholders may vote their shares of Clare common stock on all
matters not covered by the Clare voting agreements.

In addition, each Clare voting agreement prohibits the Clare stockholder who
signed that Clare voting agreement from: (a) soliciting, initiating, encouraging
or facilitating the making, submission or announcement of any offer, proposal or
indication of interest relating to a company acquisition proposal or taking any
action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an offer, proposal or
indication of interest relating to a company acquisition proposal; (b)
furnishing any information regarding Clare or any subsidiary of Clare to any
person or entity in connection with or in response to an offer, proposal or
indication of interest relating to a company acquisition proposal or any inquiry
or indication of interest that could lead to an offer, proposal or indication of
interest relating to a company acquisition proposal; (c) engaging in discussions
or negotiations with any person or entity with respect to any offer, proposal or
indication of interest relating to a company acquisition proposal; (d)
approving, endorsing or recommending any offer, proposal or indication of
interest relating to a company acquisition proposal; or (e) entering into any
letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or understanding
contemplating or otherwise relating to any company acquisition transaction. Each
Clare stockholder who signed a Clare voting agreement is also required to cease
and discontinue any existing discussions with any person or entity that relate
to any offer, proposal or indication of interest relating to a company
acquisition proposal.

In addition, each Clare voting agreement prohibits the Clare stockholder who
signed that voting agreement from transferring any shares or any voting rights
with respect to any shares of Clare common stock, or any option to purchase
shares of Clare common stock, owned by that stockholder before the termination
of the voting agreement, except to specified persons under specified conditions,
and in particular, prohibits any transfer unless each person to whom any shares
or options are transferred agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions
of the voting agreement.

that stockholder as of, or after, April 22, 2002.

Those stockholders of Clare who entered into a stock transfer restriction
agreement agreed to the restrictions set forth above for a period beginning on

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have
been prepared to give effect to the proposed merger of IXYS and Clare using the
purchase method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments described in
the accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements.

The fiscal years of IXYS and Clare end on March 31. The IXYS and the Clare
balance sheets as of December 31, 2001 and December 23, 2001, respectively have
been combined as if the merger had occurred on December 31, 2001. For purposes
of the pro forma information, the IXYS and the Clare statements of operations
for the year ended March 31, 2001 and for the nine month period ended December
31, 2001 and December 23, 2001 respectively, have been combined. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give effect to the merger
as if it had occurred on April 1, 2000.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are presented
for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the
financial position or results of operations that would have actually been
reported had the merger occurred April 1, 2000 for statements of operation
purposes and as of December 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes, nor is it
necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of
operations. The pro forma combined condensed financial statements include
adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the
allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
Clare, before any integration or restructuring adjustments. Severance payments
that become payable upon consummation of the merger due to IXYS' intention to
discontinue employment of Mr. Mihalchik and Mr. Andersen have been considered as
liabilities in purchase accounting. The final allocation of the purchase price
will be determined after the completion of the merger and will be based upon
actual net tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as liabilities
assumed. Because the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
are based upon preliminary estimates, the pro forma adjustments may differ
materially based upon the final allocation.

These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based upon
the respective historical consolidated financial statements of IXYS and Clare
and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements of IXYS and Clare and related notes and "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

On April 22, 2002, IXYS and Clare entered into a merger agreement whereby each
outstanding share of Clare common stock will be converted into 0.49147 newly
issued shares of IXYS common stock. Each outstanding option to purchase shares
of Clare common stock will be assumed also using the 0.49147 exchange ratio.
IXYS expects to issue approximately 4.9 million shares of IXYS common stock, and
options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock. The actual
number of shares of IXYS common stock and options to be issued will be
determined on the effective date of the merger using the 0.49147 exchange ratio
based on the number of shares of Clare common stock and options actually
outstanding on such date. IXYS will account for the merger as a purchase.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2001
combines the IXYS and Clare consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2001 and
December 23, 2001 as if the merger had been consummated on that date.

Tax savings from the combined entities' potential opportunity to offset taxable
income with tax losses generated through other operations have not been
considered in the pro forma statements of operations.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the year
ended March 31, 2001, and for the nine month period ended December 31, 2001 give
effect to the proposed merger as if it had occurred on April 1, 2000. The
unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations combine the results of
operations of IXYS and Clare for the respective periods.

2.  PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect an
estimated purchase price of approximately $57.8 million. The preliminary fair
value of IXYS' common stock to be issued was determined using the five trading
day average price surrounding the date the acquisition was announced of $10.0487
per share. The preliminary fair value of IXYS' stock options to be issued was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the options: expected life
of 2 years, risk-free interest rate of 3.4%, expected volatility of 162% and no
expected dividend yield. The final purchase price is dependent on the actual
number of shares of common stock exchanged, the actual number of options issued,
and actual direct merger costs. The final purchase price will be determined upon
completion of the merger. The estimated total purchase price of the proposed
Clare merger is as follows (in thousands):

Value of IXYS common stock to be issued.....................  $48,891
Value of IXYS options to be issued..........................    7,393
Estimated direct merger costs...............................    1,550
                                                              -------
Total estimated purchase price..............................  $57,834
                                                              =======

Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price is
allocated to Clare's net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon
their estimated fair value as of the date of completion of the merger. Any
excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the estimated purchase
price (excess over costs) is allocated as a pro rata reduction to plant and
equipment and intangible assets acquired. Based upon the estimated purchase
price and the preliminary independent valuation, the

A preliminary estimate of $6.7 million has been allocated to identifiable
intangible assets with useful lives ranging from 3 months to 6 years as follows:

Contract agreement -- 3 years; Core technology -- 5 to 6 years;
Tradename/Trademarks -- 3 years; Order backlog -- 3 to 6 months; Favorable
licensing agreement -- 6 years.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Clare's historical book values of plant and equipment have been adjusted by an
increase of $2.7 million. The average remaining useful lives of plant and
equipment amounts to 3.4 years, resulting in additional depreciation to be
recorded of $791,000 for the 12 month period ended March 31, 2001 and of
$593,000 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2001. Depreciation is
allocated to cost of sales (71%), research and development expenses (9%) and
selling, general and administrative expenses (20%). No fair value was attributed
to deferred revenue recorded by Clare. Therefore, the book value of liabilities
recorded by Clare was reduced by $2.8 million to their estimated fair value of
$6.6 million.

An additional deferred tax liability of $3.3 million has been recognized on the
difference between the tax values of amortizable intangible assets and plant and
equipment and their estimated book value for financial reporting purposes after
the merger at a tax rate of 38.6%. A short term deferred tax asset has been
recognized on the severance payments set up as part of purchase accounting
($560,000). Existing valuation allowances on short-term deferred tax assets
($1.3 million) and long-term deferred tax assets ($1.5 million) have been
reversed to the extend a deferred tax liability has been set up resulting in an
additional net deferred tax liability of $1.9 million.

3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

There were no transactions between IXYS and Clare. Certain reclassifications
have been made to conform Clare's historical amounts to IXYS' financial
statement presentation.

The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any integration adjustments such as
restructuring costs to be incurred in connection with the merger or operating
efficiencies and cost savings that may be achieved with respect to the combined
entity. Severance payments to Mr. Mihalchik of approximately $1.2 million and to
Mr. Andersen of approximately $200,000 were included as liabilities in purchase
accounting.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been
prepared as if the merger was completed on December 31, 2001 for balance sheet
purposes and as of April 1, 2000 for statement of operations purposes and
reflect the following pro forma adjustments:

(a)  To record the step-up on plant and equipment. The step-up was determined
     based on estimated fair values of plant and equipment, reduced by the
     proportionate allocation of excess over costs (see Note 2). The estimated
     fair value was determined based on an independent draft appraisal.

(b)  To establish amortizable intangible assets acquired.

     (b1)  To eliminate Clare's amortizable intangible assets and goodwill
           resulting from prior acquisitions.

     (b2)  To establish identifiable intangible assets and goodwill resulting
           from the proposed merger at their estimated fair value, reduced by
           the proportionate allocation of excess over costs (see Note 2).

(c)  To reduce deferred revenue to its estimated fair value of $0.

(d)  To establish the deferred tax effects of entries (a) and (b) (see Note 2
     above).

(e)  To record severance payments for Mr. Mihalchik and Mr. Andersen in
     accordance with their employment contracts.

           issued in the proposed merger.

(g)  To record additional depreciation due to the step-up of plant and

(h)  To reflect amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2.2 million for
     the year ended March 31, 2001 and $1.3 million for the nine-month period
     ended December 31, 2001, net of amortization expense previously recorded by
     Clare on acquired existing technology of $807,000 and $708,000,
     respectively.

(i)  To remove goodwill amortization previously recorded by Clare.

(j)  To record the tax effect of the additional depreciation of plant and
     equipment and additional amortization of intangible assets acquired.

4.  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE DATA

Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma combined net loss per basic and
diluted share were computed by adding 4.9 million shares assumed to be issued in
exchange for the outstanding Clare shares and for shares assumed to be issued to
financial advisors in connection with this transaction to IXYS' weighted average
shares outstanding. As the pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement
of operations for all periods presented shows a net loss, weighted average basic
and diluted shares are the same.

                                 IXYS' BUSINESS

GENERAL

IXYS is a leading company in the design, development, manufacture and marketing
of high power, high performance power semiconductors. Its power semiconductors
improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at
relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power
required by electronic products. IXYS focuses on the market for power
semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than 500 watts of power.

IXYS was founded in 1983. In 1989, IXYS acquired from ABB its semiconductor
operation in Lampertheim, Germany, now called IXYS Semiconductor GmbH. This
acquisition provided IXYS with a strong foothold in Europe.

In 1995, IXYS reincorporated in Delaware. Also in 1995, ABB converted
approximately $10.5 million in debt owed to it by IXYS into IXYS' capital stock.
In January 1998, IXYS purchased the Lampertheim facility, which had previously
been leased from ABB.

In September 1998, IXYS Corporation merged with Paradigm Technology, a Delaware
corporation that designed and marketed SRAM products, in a transaction accounted
for as a reverse merger. In the merger, Paradigm issued its common stock in
exchange for all outstanding shares of our capital stock. At the conclusion of
the merger, IXYS stockholders held approximately 96% of the combined company,
and the historical accounting records of IXYS became those of the combined
company. Accordingly, Paradigm formally changed its name to "IXYS Corporation."

In May 2000, IXYS acquired Directed Energy, which gave it added scientific
expertise and additional products related to laser diode drives, high voltage
pulse generators and modulators. In connection with this acquisition, IXYS
issued 250,370 shares of its common stock to the former shareholders of Directed
Energy in a transaction that was accounted for under the purchase method.

On January 22, 2002, IXYS acquired Westcode Semiconductors Limited, a UK-based
power semiconductor manufacturer, for approximately $9.0 million in cash.

IXYS' power semiconductor products have historically been divided into two
primary categories, power metal oxide semiconductor, or MOS, transistors and
bipolar products. Its power semiconductors are sold as individual units and are
also packaged in high power modules that frequently consist of multiple
semiconductor dies. In fiscal year 2001, power semiconductors constituted
approximately 92% of IXYS' revenues, which included 49% from power MOS
transistors and 43% from bipolar products. IXYS also sells gallium arsenide
products, which has become a primary product category. In addition to power
semiconductors, IXYS manufactures its proprietary direct copper bond, or DCB,
substrate for use in its own power semiconductors as well as for sale to other
power semiconductor manufacturers. IXYS also sells integrated circuits, or ICs,
that have applications associated with power management, and high speed, high
density static random access memory, or SRAM, products.

IXYS' products are used primarily to control electricity in:

      --   power conversion systems, including uninterruptible power supplies,
           or UPS, and switch mode power supplies, or SMPS, for communications
           infrastructure applications such as wireless base stations, network
           servers and telecommunication switching stations;

      --   motor drives for industrial applications such as industrial
           transportation, robotics and process control equipment; and

      --   medical electronics for sophisticated applications, such as
           defibrillators and medical imaging.

IXYS designs its products primarily for industrial and business applications,
rather than for use in personal computers, mobile phones or other household
appliances.

In fiscal year 2001, IXYS sold its products to over 2,000 customers worldwide.
Its major customers include ASCOM, Still, Siemens, Guidant, Medtronics, Tyco,
Astec, Delta Electronics and Huawei. In many cases, IXYS' customers incorporate
its products into systems sold to their own customers, which include Ericsson,
General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Motorola and Nokia.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

Demand for electricity in the 21st century is forecasted to increase faster than
demand for other forms of energy. The worldwide demand for electrical energy is
currently increasing due to:

      --   proliferation of technology driven products that require electricity,
           including computers, telecommunications equipment and the
           infrastructure to support portable electronics;

      --   increased use of electronic content in traditional products such as
           airplanes, automobiles and home appliances;

      --   increased use of automation and electrical processes in industry and
           mass transit systems; and

      --   penetration of technology into developing countries.

Not only is demand increasing, but the requirements for electricity are also
changing. Electronic products in all markets are becoming increasingly
sophisticated, offering more "intelligence" through the use of microprocessors
and additional components. For example, the Information Technology Industry
Council reports that computers represented 13% of U.S. electrical consumption in
1998, versus only 6% in 1994. The increasing complexity of such products
requires more precisely regulated power quality and greater power reliability.
In addition, the increasing costs of electricity, coupled with governmental
regulations and environmental concerns, have caused an increased demand for
energy efficiency.

Power semiconductors are used to provide the precisely regulated power required
by sophisticated electronic products and equipment and address the growing
demand for energy efficiency. In most cases, power semiconductors:

      --   convert or "rectify" alternating current, or AC, power delivered by
           electrical utilities to direct current, or DC, power which is
           required by most electronic equipment;

      --   convert DC power at a certain voltage level to DC power at a
           different voltage level to meet the specific voltage requirement for
           an application;

      --   invert DC power to high frequency AC power to permit the processing
           of power using substantially smaller electronic components; or

      --   rectify high frequency AC power from switch-mode power supplies to
           meet the specific DC voltage required by an application.

The more sophisticated the end product, the greater its need for specially
formatted, finely regulated power, and the greater its need for a high
performance power semiconductor. According to the Digital Power Report, less
than 15% of the world's electricity is currently switched by power
semiconductors, but this percentage is expected to grow significantly to meet
the need for higher quality power.

Power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by processing and
converting electrical energy into more usable, higher quality power.
Specifically, power semiconductors are used primarily in controlling energy in
power conversion systems, including switch mode power supplies, or SMPS, and
uninterruptible power supplies, or UPS, and motor drive controls. Switch mode
power supplies efficiently convert power to meet the specific voltage
requirements of an application, such as communications equipment.
Uninterruptible power supplies provide a short term backup of electricity in the
event of power failure. Motor drive controls regulate the voltage, current and
frequency of power to a motor.

MARKET SIZE AND TRENDS

The primary markets IXYS serves are characterized by complex technological
development and higher power level requirements. IXYS believes the following key
trends are driving the demand for its products:

Growth in communications devices and infrastructure. The worldwide
communications industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years, fueled
largely by growth in the Internet, deregulation, competition, privatization and
other technological advances, including the convergence of voice, video and data
communication. The proliferation of electronic devices and the infrastructure to
support them is resulting in increasing power level requirements and the demand
for greater power reliability.

Increased demand for energy efficiency in motor drives. Electronic motors
consume approximately one-half of the world's electricity. Due to costs and
complexity, motor controls that permit variable speed operation, which in turn
reduce energy consumption, have been predominantly used only in higher end
applications. However, recent advancements in power management enable more cost
effective, variable speed motor controls, which enhance energy efficiency and
improve performance in a wide range of industrial and commercial applications,
such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

Emergence of new applications in medical electronics. Continued advancements in
medical technologies are resulting in more sophisticated medical electronic
devices. Power semiconductors can greatly reduce the size of equipment and
improve the precision of medical measurements and functionality. For example,
power semiconductors have enabled cardiac defibrillators to become much smaller
and more portable, improving the ability to install these devices in more
non-medical establishments, such as airplanes and office buildings.

Development of new technologies for power management. New technologies such as
the use of radio frequency, or RF, for nontraditional power applications are
opening new markets for power semiconductors. For example, RF based
semiconductor production equipment is migrating to high frequency power MOS
transistors from traditional RF tubes. Additionally, material science
developments, such as gallium arsenide, are enabling the production of higher
power density power management products, such as those required for wireless
base stations.

Demand for increasing power density. The need for higher levels of power in end
use applications is causing purchasers of power semiconductors to demand more
power for their applications from the same physical space. In the communications
industry, the growth in bandwidth demands is requiring communications equipment
providers to add more equipment or more powerful equipment to confined spaces in
highly populated areas. As a result, power semiconductor manufacturers are being
required to design and produce products that enable their customers to expand
power levels without expanding product footprints, or maintaining levels of
power while shrinking product footprints.

IXYS' STRATEGY

Since its inception, IXYS has focused on meeting the needs of the high power,
high performance segment of the power semiconductor market. IXYS intends to
continue building a leading position within its targeted segment of this market
by pursuing the following strategies:

Maintain technological focus on high power, high performance market. IXYS'
technological expertise enables it to focus on the high power, high performance
power semiconductor market. Due to technological complexities, fewer industry
players compete in this market, resulting in a more favorable competitive
environment for IXYS. IXYS believes its technological expertise differentiates
it from most of its competitors. This expertise encompasses a wide range of
scientific disciplines and technical capabilities, including physics, mechanical
engineering, chemistry, circuit design, material science and packaging. Using
its technological expertise, IXYS continually strives to introduce innovative
products. For example, IXYS has recently brought to market a gallium arsenide
rectifier, one use of which will permit increased power density in wireless base
stations, as well as higher current gallium arsenide products for surface mount
packages.

Target rapid growth opportunities within the high power, high performance
market. IXYS selects the specific markets where it intends to compete by
evaluating their potential growth, its ability to establish an advantage based
upon its technological capabilities and the performance of competing products.
For example, to capitalize on the power density and switching speed of its
products, IXYS has entered the telecommunications and data communications
segments of the communications infrastructure market. These segments include
applications for wireless base stations, internet servers for co-location
facilities and storage area networks.

Continue to diversify markets, customers and products. IXYS believes that
diversifying the markets and customers it serves and the products it produces
enables it to minimize the traditional cyclical effects of the semiconductor
industry on its business. IXYS has a significant market presence in Europe,
North America and Asia, the three principal geographic markets for high
performance power semiconductors. Moreover, IXYS' products are used in a broad
range of applications, from communications infrastructure to industrial
automation to medical electronics, thereby reducing its reliance on customers
from any particular industry. IXYS' product line spans a broad range of
functionality and price, which allows it to provide an appropriate solution to
most of its customers' power semiconductor needs. This product diversity permits
IXYS' customers to reduce the number of their suppliers by enabling them to
purchase a substantial portion of their power semiconductor needs from IXYS.

Pursue selective acquisition and investment strategy. IXYS seeks to access
additional technological capabilities and complementary product lines through
selective acquisitions and strategic investments. For example, through the
acquisition of Directed Energy, Inc. in May 2000, IXYS added scientific
expertise and additional products related to laser diode drivers, high voltage
pulse generators and modulators. Additionally, through the acquisition of
Westcode Semiconductors Limited, a UK-based power semiconductor manufacturer, in
January 2002, IXYS added a portfolio of very high power semiconductors products
that will supplement existing its product line. Westcode's products are used in
a variety of applications including induction heating, welding, motion controls
(AC and DC drives), traction, electric vehicles and HVDC. IXYS also believes
there are significant opportunities to capitalize on its extensive distribution
system and market additional products to many of its 2,000 customers.

Collaborate with select companies on product development. IXYS seeks to enter
into collaborative arrangements with existing and potential customers in
attractive end user markets in order to optimize its products for their use.
IXYS believes that its ability to provide technical assistance to these
companies in the design of their hardware and software systems encourages the
incorporation of its products in their devices. For example, IXYS partnered with
manufacturers of portable defibrillators at an early stage in the development of
this market, and it has become a leading supplier of power semiconductors for
these devices. In addition, IXYS has had over 300 design wins in each of the
last three years.

Optimize mix between internal and external manufacturing. IXYS intends to
continue using both internal wafer fabrication facilities and its external
foundry relationships. IXYS also seeks to balance its product assembly through
multiple sourcing relationships. IXYS believes these strategies enable it to
maximize its manufacturing efficiency and flexibility. IXYS also believes that
its internal manufacturing capabilities enable it to lower its manufacturing
cost with respect to certain products, bring products to market more quickly
than would be possible if it were required to rely exclusively on external
foundries, retain certain proprietary aspects of its process technology and more
quickly introduce new process and product innovations through close
collaboration between its design and process engineers. IXYS' alliances with
external foundries and assembly subcontractors allow it to substantially reduce
capital spending and manufacturing overhead expenses, obtain competitive pricing
and technologies and expand manufacturing capacity more rapidly than could be
achieved with internal facilities alone.

PRODUCTS

IXYS' power semiconductor products have historically been divided into two
primary categories, power MOS transistors and bipolar products. IXYS' power
semiconductors are sold separately and are also packaged in high power modules
that frequently consist of multiple semiconductor dies. In fiscal year

2001, power semiconductors constituted approximately 92% of IXYS' revenues,
which included 49% from power MOS transistors and 43% from bipolar products. In
fiscal year 2000, power semiconductors constituted approximately 92% of IXYS'
revenues, which included 45% from power MOS transistors and 47% from bipolar
products. In fiscal year 1999, power semiconductors constituted approximately
91% of IXYS' revenues, which included 43% from power MOS transistors and 48%
from bipolar products. IXYS sells gallium arsenide products, which has become a
primary product category. In addition to power semiconductors, IXYS manufactures
its proprietary DCB substrate for use in its own power semiconductors as well as
for sale to other power semiconductor manufacturers. IXYS also sells ICs that
have applications associated with power management, and high speed, high density
SRAM products.

Power MOS Transistors. Power MOS transistors offer significant price/performance
benefits over traditional bipolar transistors. Power MOS transistors operate at
much greater switching speeds, allowing the design of smaller and less costly
end products, primarily due to the smaller and less expensive peripheral
components required at higher switching frequencies. Power MOS transistors are
activated by voltage rather than current, so they require less external
circuitry to operate, making them more compatible with IC controls. Power MOS
transistors also offer more reliable long term performance and are more rugged
than traditional bipolar transistors, permitting them to better withstand
adverse operating conditions. IXYS' power MOS transistors consist of power
MOSFETs and IGBTs.

Power MOSFETs. A power MOSFET, or metal oxide semiconductor field effect
transistor, is a switch controlled by voltage at its gate. Power MOSFETs are
used in combination with passive components to vary the amperage and frequency
of electricity by switching on and off at high frequency.

IXYS' power MOSFETs are used primarily in power conversion systems and are
focused on higher voltage applications ranging from 60 to 1,100 volts. IXYS'
power MOSFETs have on state resistance among the lowest available for a given
die size and voltage. Lower on state resistance results in increased efficiency
of a power semiconductor device. IXYS believes that as the power requirements of
workstations, servers and other computers increase as the result of larger and
more powerful microprocessors, disk drives and CD/ROMs, the designers of power
supplies will increasingly demand higher power density. MOSFETs accommodate this
need by providing higher power without increasing the physical size of the power
supply incorporated into the equipment.

IGBTs. IGBTs, or insulated gate bipolar transistors, also are used as switches.
IGBTs have achieved many of the advantages of power MOSFETs and of traditional
bipolar technology by combining the voltage controlled switching features of
power MOSFETs with the superior conductivity and energy efficiency of bipolar
transistors. For a given semiconductor die size, IGBTs can operate at higher
currents and voltages, making them a more cost effective device compared to
power MOSFETs for high energy applications. The principal tradeoff of IGBTs
compared to power MOSFETs is the switching speed of IGBTs, which is slower than
that of power MOSFETs. IGBTs are seldom used in applications where very fast
switching is required, including SMPS operating at speeds over 150 kilohertz.

Since inception, IXYS has been a leader in the development of IGBTs for high
voltage applications. In 1986, IXYS introduced the first 800 volt, 50 amp device
into the market. IXYS' current products are focused on voltage applications
ranging from 300 volts to 2,000 volts. IXYS' IGBTs are used principally in AC
motor drives and defibrillators.

Bipolar Products. Bipolar products are also used to process electricity, but are
activated by current rather than voltage. Bipolar products are capable of
switching electricity at substantially higher power levels than power MOS
transistors. However, switching speeds of bipolar products are slower than those
of power MOS transistors, and as a result, bipolar products are preferred where
very high power is required. IXYS' bipolar products consist of rectifiers and
thyristors.

Rectifiers. Rectifiers convert AC power to DC power and are used primarily in
input and output rectification and inverters. IXYS' rectifiers are used in DC
and AC motor drives, power supplies, lighting and heating controls and welding
equipment.

A subset of IXYS' rectifier product group is a very fast switching device known
as a FRED, or fast recovery epitaxial diode. FREDs limit spikes in voltage
across the power switch to reduce power dissipation and electromagnetic
interference. IXYS' FREDs are used principally in AC motor drives and power
supplies.

Thyristors. Thyristors are switches that can be turned on by a controlled signal
and turned off only when the output current is reduced to zero, which occurs in
the flow of AC power. Thyristors are preferred over power MOSFETs and IGBTs in
high voltage, low frequency AC applications because their on state resistance is
lower than the on state resistance of power MOSFETs and IGBTs. IXYS' thyristors
are used in motor drives, defibrillators, power supplies, lighting and heating
controls and welding.

Gallium Arsenide Products

IXYS began to sell gallium arsenide products in fiscal year 2000. Its first
gallium arsenide product was a Schottky rectifier, useful for high power density
applications, such as power supplies for wireless communications base stations.
Gallium arsenide offers higher frequency and higher temperature operation,
enabling substantially greater power density than silicon-based solutions.

Other Products

IXYS manufactures its proprietary DCB substrates for use in its own
semiconductor products as well as for sale to a variety of customers, including
those in the power semiconductor industry. DCB technology cost effectively
provides excellent thermal transfer while maintaining high electrical isolation.
This technology addresses thermal fatigue and die cracking problems encountered
by manufacturers of power semiconductor modules utilizing traditional copper
base plates.

IXYS also markets ICs that have applications associated with power
semiconductors, such as high voltage current regulators, motion controllers,
digital pulse width modulators and power MOSFET/IGBT drivers. Additionally, IXYS
manufactures and sells laser diode drivers, high voltage pulse generators and
modulators and sell synchronous and asynchronous SRAMs, a legacy product from
the Paradigm merger. IXYS' SRAMs are available in a variety of configurations
and commercial and industrial temperature range versions.

CUSTOMERS AND APPLICATIONS

IXYS also sells its power semiconductor chips and DCB substrates to other power
semiconductor companies for use in their modules. These customers include
Infineon, International Rectifier, Powersem and Tyco.

SALES AND MARKETING

IXYS sells its products through a worldwide selling organization that includes
direct sales personnel, independent representatives and distributors managed
through IXYS' Santa Clara, California and Lampertheim, Germany offices. As of
March 31, 2002, IXYS employed 37 people in sales and marketing and customer
support and service and used 15 sales representative organizations and six
distributors in North America and 38 sales representative organizations and
distributors in the rest of the world. Sales to distributors accounted for
approximately 41% of net revenues in fiscal year 1999, 42% of net revenues in
fiscal year 2000 and 43% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001.

In fiscal year 2001, North American sales represented approximately 40%, and
international sales represented approximately 60%, of IXYS' net revenues; for
the nine months ended December 31, 2001, North American sales represented
approximately 35%, and international sales represented approximately 65%, of
IXYS' net revenues. Of IXYS' international sales, in fiscal year 2001,
approximately 70% were derived from sales in Europe and the Middle East and
approximately 30% were derived from sales in Asia; for the nine months ended
December 31, 2001, approximately 76% were derived from sales in Europe and the
Middle East and approximately 24% were derived from sales in Asia. No single end
customer accounted for more than 10% of IXYS' net revenues in fiscal year 2001.
For financial information about segments and geographic areas for each of IXYS'
last three fiscal years, see IXYS' Audited Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 14, Segment and Geographic Information provided elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.

IXYS markets its products through advertisements, technical articles and press
releases that appear regularly in a variety of trade publications, as well as
through the dissemination of brochures, data sheets and technical manuals.
Additionally, IXYS participates in industry trade shows on a regular basis. IXYS
also have a presence on the Internet through a worldwide web page that enables
engineers to access and download technical information and data sheets.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

IXYS believes that it successfully competes in the power semiconductor market
because of its ability to design, develop and introduce to the market on a
timely basis new products offering technological improvements. IXYS is a pioneer
in technology with respect to higher power IGBTs, IGBT modules and DCB
substrates. While the time from initiation of design to volume production of new
power semiconductors products often takes 18 months or longer, IXYS' power
semiconductors have a product lifetime exceeding an average of 10 years. IXYS'
research and development expenses were approximately $4.2 million in fiscal year
1999, $4.7 million in fiscal year 2000 and $6.1 million in fiscal year 2001. As
of March 31, 2002, IXYS employed 73 people in engineering and research and
development activities.

IXYS is engaged in ongoing research and development efforts focused on
enhancements to existing products and the development of new products.
Currently, IXYS is pursuing research and development projects with respect to:

      --   increasing the voltage operating range of its MOS and bipolar
           products;

      --   developing new gallium arsenide products;

      --   developing higher power IGBT modules;

      --   developing a complete range of high voltage, bipolar MOS products;

      --   improving its multiple die module assembly technology; and

      --   expanding its line of power management IC products.

Research and development activities are conducted in collaboration with
manufacturing activities to help expedite new products from the development
phase to manufacturing and to more quickly implement new process technologies.

IXYS' research and development efforts also include participation in technology
collaborations with universities and research institutions. These technology
collaborations allow research and development activities that would otherwise
require potentially cost prohibitive capital expenditures since the necessary
capital equipment is often available at research institutes and universities.
Through these technology collaborations, IXYS believes it is able to maximize
its range of research and development activities without diffusing the focus of
its internal research and development work.

PATENTS

As of March 31, 2002, IXYS held 72 issued patents, including 42 that were issued
in the U.S. and 30 that were issued in international jurisdictions. As of March
31, 2002, IXYS also held 61 pending patents, including 28 pending in the U.S.
and 33 pending in international jurisdictions. IXYS relies on a combination of
patent rights, copyrights and trade secrets to protect the proprietary elements
of its products. IXYS' policy is to file patent applications to protect
technology, inventions and improvements that are important to its business. IXYS
also seeks to protect its trade secrets and proprietary technology, in part,
through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other
parties.

While IXYS believes that its intellectual property rights are valuable, it also
believes that other factors, such as innovative skills, technical expertise, the
ability to adapt quickly to new technologies and evolving customer requirements,
product support and customer relations, are of greater competitive significance.

MANUFACTURING AND FACILITIES

The production of IXYS' products is a highly complex and precise process. IXYS
manufactures its products in its own manufacturing facilities and by utilizing
external wafer foundries and subcontract assembly facilities. IXYS divides its
manufacturing operations into three key areas, wafer fabrication, assembly and
test.

Wafer Fabrication. IXYS owns an approximately 170,000 square foot manufacturing
facility in Lampertheim, Germany at which it fabricates all of its bipolar
products, and an approximately 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in
Chippenham, England where it fabricates the majority of its very high power
devices. IXYS also fabricates its 1,600 volt and higher power MOS devices in
Lampertheim, Germany in order to protect its process technologies. IXYS believe
that its internal fabrication capabilities enable it to lower its manufacturing
cost with respect to certain products, bring products to the market more quickly
than would be possible if it were required to rely exclusively on external
foundries, retain certain proprietary aspects of its process technology and more
quickly introduce new process innovations.

In addition to maintaining its own fabrication facilities, IXYS has established
alliances with selected foundries for wafer fabrication. This approach allows it
to reduce substantial capital spending and manufacturing overhead expenses,
obtain competitive pricing and technologies and expand manufacturing capacity
more rapidly than could be achieved with internal foundries alone. IXYS retains
the flexibility to shift the production of its products to different or
additional foundries for cost or performance reasons. IXYS' product designs
enable the production of its devices at multiple foundries using well
established and cost effective processes.

IXYS relied on external foundries for approximately 57% of its wafer fabrication
requirements in fiscal year 2001, and its utilization of external foundries is
expected to grow. IXYS has arrangements with four external wafer foundries, two
of which provide substantially all of the wafers provided to it by external
foundries. IXYS' principal external foundry is Samsung Electronics' facility
located in Kiheung, South Korea. IXYS' relationship with Samsung Electronics
extends over 17 years. IXYS provides its foundries forecasts for wafer
fabrication six months in advance and makes firm purchase commitments one to two
months in advance of delivery. Other than these firm commitments, IXYS does not
have any obligations to order any minimum quantities.

Wafer fabrication of power semiconductors generally employs process technology
and equipment already proven in IC manufacturing. Power semiconductors are
manufactured using fabrication equipment that is one or more generations behind
the equipment used to fabricate leading edge ICs. Used fabrication equipment can
be obtained at prices substantially less than the original cost of such
equipment or than the cost of current equipment applying the latest technology.
Consequently, the fabrication of power semiconductors is less capital intensive
than the fabrication of ICs.

Assembly. Packaging or assembly is the sequence of production steps that divide
the wafer into individual chips and enclose the chips in external structures,
termed packages, that make them useable in a circuit. Discrete manufacturing
involves the assembly and packaging of single die devices. Module manufacturing
involves the assembly of multiple devices within a single package. The resulting
packages vary in configuration, but all have leads that are used to mount the
package through holes in the customer's printed circuit boards.

Most of IXYS' wafers are sent to independent subcontract assembly facilities.
IXYS has equipment at, or manufacturing supply arrangements with, assembly
subcontractors located in Asia and Europe in order to take advantage of low
assembly costs. Approximately 60% of IXYS' products are assembled at external
assembly facilities, and the remainder are assembled in IXYS' Lampertheim
facility.

Test. Generally, each die on IXYS' wafers is electrically tested for performance
after wafer fabrication. Following assembly, IXYS' products are returned to
Santa Clara, California or Lampertheim, Germany for testing and final inspection
prior to shipment to customers. IXYS leases an approximately 20,000 square foot
facility in Santa Clara, which also houses its corporate offices. IXYS tests
substantially all of its IGBTs, power MOSFETs and ICs in Santa Clara and tests
its bipolar and custom MOS modules in Lampertheim.

COMPETITION

The power semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized
by price competition, technological change, limited fabrication capacity,
international competition and manufacturing yield problems. The competitive
factors in the market for IXYS' products include:

      --   product quality, reliability and performance;

      --   product features;

      --   timely delivery of products;

      --   price;

      --   breadth of product line;

      --   design and introduction of new products; and

      --   technical support and service.

IXYS believes that it is one of a limited group of companies focused on the
development and marketing of high power, high performance semiconductors capable
of performing all of the basic functions of power semiconductor design and
manufacture. IXYS' primary competitors include Advanced Power Technology,

Fuji, International Rectifier, Infineon, On Semiconductor, Semikron
International, Powerex, STMicroelectronics, Siemens and Toshiba.

BACKLOG

At March 31, 2002, IXYS' backlog of orders was approximately $31.1 million, as
compared with $49.5 million at March 31, 2001. IXYS reasonably expects its
backlog of orders at March 31, 2002 to be filled within the current fiscal year.
Backlog represents firm orders anticipated to be shipped within the next 12
months. IXYS' business and, to a large extent, that of the entire semiconductor
industry is characterized by short term order and shipment schedules. Because
orders constituting IXYS' current backlog are subject to changes in delivery
schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant
penalty, backlog is not necessarily an indication of future revenues.

EMPLOYEES

At March 31, 2002, IXYS employed 626 employees, of whom 73 were primarily
engaged in engineering and research and development activities, 37 in marketing,
sales and customer support, 476 in manufacturing and 40 in administration and
finance. Of these employees, 70 hold engineering or science degrees, including
16 Ph.D.s. Certain employees at IXYS' Lampertheim facility and IXYS' Chippenham
facility are subject to collective bargaining agreements. There have been no
work stoppages at any of IXYS' facilities to date. IXYS believes that its
employee relations are good.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 22, 2000, International Rectifier Corporation filed an action for patent
infringement against IXYS in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, alleging that certain of IXYS' products sold in the
United States, including but not limited to four specified power MOSFET parts,
infringe five identified U.S. patents owned by International Rectifier (U.S.
Patents No. 4,959,699; No. 5,008,725; No. 5,130,767; No. 4,642,666; and No.
4,705,759). International Rectifier has since notified IXYS that it no longer
contends that IXYS infringes two of those patents (U.S. Patents No. 4,705,759
and No. 4,642,666), and has refined its allegations of infringement to embrace
all of IXYS' power MOSFETs and IGBTs having "elongated" cells. This designation
covers many of IXYS' power MOSFET and IGBT products sold in the United States.

International Rectifier's complaint against IXYS contends that IXYS' alleged
infringement of International Rectifier's patents has been and continues to be
willful and deliberate, seeks to enjoin IXYS from further infringement and
requests an award of actual monetary damages on sales of products that are
claimed to infringe International Rectifier's patents. International Rectifier
also seeks to have the damages trebled.

IXYS has answered the complaint, denied any infringement and asserted that
International Rectifier's patents are invalid and unenforceable for, among other
reasons, failure of International Rectifier to properly disclose known prior art
during its prosecution of the patents in suit, and that International
Rectifier's claims are barred by reason of the doctrines of estoppel and laches.
In prior years, International Rectifier had approached IXYS on several occasions
and requested that IXYS enter into royalty-bearing license agreements with
International Rectifier, under its patents. IXYS has declined to do so, based
upon IXYS' belief that its products do not infringe the International Rectifier
patents. The case had been scheduled for trial on June 12, 2001. In May 2001,
however, in view of newly issued patent claims added to the case by
International Rectifier, the U.S. District Court vacated the trial date, set a
new discovery cut-off date of July 16, 2001 scheduled a further pre-trial
conference for August 6, 2001, and deferred setting a new trial date. In view of
other newly issued claims that International Rectifier added to the case, the
U.S. District Court vacated the prior dates, set a new discovery cut-off date of
November 5, 2001, and set a new pre-trial conference date of November 26, 2001.
At the pre-trial conference, the U.S. District

Court set trial for February 26, 2002. On its own initiative, the U.S. District
Court continued that trial date to April 30, 2002 and again to June 25, 2002.

In May 2001, the U.S. District Court also granted motions for summary
adjudication dismissing IXYS' second and eighth affirmative defenses, relating
to its contentions that certain of the patent claims are invalid over a prior
invention by Dr. Jean Hoerni, and that claims for alleged infringement by
certain products have been released in a settlement between International
Rectifier and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). Samsung fabricates
IXYS-designed wafers for IXYS in Korea. In July 2001, the U.S. District Court
also granted motions for summary adjudication, dismissing IXYS' affirmative
defense that the claims of U.S. Patent No. 4,959,699 are invalid for
non-compliance with the so-called "written description" requirement of Section
112 of the Patent Statute, finding that IXYS' power MOSFET devices having
"elongated" cells infringe claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 4,959,699 and denying
IXYS' countermotions on the same or similar issues. Since that time, the U.S.
District Court has granted International Rectifier's motions for summary
adjudication on all of IXYS' remaining affirmative defenses asserting patent
invalidity and unenforceability, and for infringement of various additional
claims of patent 4,959,699, as well as various claims of patent 5,008,725 and
patent 5,130,767. On April 29, 2002, International Rectifier moved for entry of
judgment under 28 USC Section 1292(c)(2), and also for entry of permanent
injunction against those IXYS devices found to infringe any of the claims of the
subject International Rectifier patents, with hearing of the motion scheduled
for May 20, 2002. IXYS expects to appeal most of the U.S. District Court's
numerous summary judgment rulings, including all rulings of patent infringement.
Moreover, if the U.S. District Court enters a permanent injunction, IXYS will
ask the applicable appellate court, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, to stay the injunction pending appeal. It remains IXYS' intent
to contest the claims of International Rectifier vigorously. While IXYS believes
its defenses to these various claims and its arguments on appeal are
meritorious, there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome. In the event of
an adverse outcome, damages or injunctions awarded by the U.S. District Court
could be materially adverse to IXYS' financial condition and results of
operations.

International Rectifier also contends that IXYS' importation of IXYS-designed
MOSFET products into the United States having the "elongated" cells manufactured
for IXYS by Samsung is in violation of a consent decree and injunction entered
against Samsung in another lawsuit that did not involve IXYS. In February 2001,
International Rectifier served Samsung and IXYS with a Post-Judgment Ex Parte
Application for Order to Show Cause Re Contempt seeking, among other things, an
enforcement of the injunction for IXYS' importation into the United States of
parts designed by IXYS and manufactured for IXYS by Samsung that infringe claim
1 of International Rectifier's U.S. Patent No. 4,959,699 and an appropriate
fine. IXYS moved to clarify or modify the injunction to exclude IXYS devices, if
construed to cover IXYS devices. Samsung contends that IXYS is contractually
obligated under the terms of IXYS' wafer supply agreement with Samsung to defend
it against the contempt claims made by International Rectifier and indemnify and
hold Samsung harmless in connection with such claims. IXYS is considering
Samsung's request in light of the terms of the wafer supply agreement. While
IXYS believes that neither it nor Samsung are or could be in violation of the
injunction for various reasons IXYS believes to be meritorious, including an
express reservation as to IXYS' designed parts in the consent decree, there can
be no assurance of a favorable outcome. In the event of an adverse ruling
against IXYS on the ultimate issue of contempt, or if IXYS is obligated to
defend and indemnify Samsung, any damages awarded or injunction entered by the
U.S. District Court could be materially adverse to IXYS' financial condition and
results of operations. Argument concerning the order to show cause was held May
18, 2001, at which time the U.S. District Court remarked that IXYS is bound by
the Samsung injunction, and that IXYS and Samsung attempted to subvert the
injunction by having IXYS take delivery outside the United States of products
designed by IXYS and made for IXYS by Samsung, but deferred decision as to
whether IXYS and Samsung are in contempt. IXYS expects to appeal any ruling of
contempt. In March 2002, no decision having been reached on its earlier motion,
IXYS renewed and amended its motion to clarify, modify or vacate the Samsung
injunction as to IXYS devices. On March 19, 2002, the U.S. District Court
adopted and entered Interim Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that
decided, among other things,

that IXYS is bound by the injunction and IXYS devices are not excepted from the
injunction. IXYS immediately appealed each of these rulings to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 1, 2002, the U.S. District Court
denied IXYS' renewed motion to clarify, modify or vacate the injunction. IXYS
immediately appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. On April 5, 2002, IXYS asked the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit to stay the injunction pending outcome of its appeals. On April 8, 2002,
International Rectifier opposed the stay and moved to dismiss the first appeal.
On April 10, 2002 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed the
injunction pending further proceedings.

In November 2000, IXYS filed a lawsuit for patent infringement against
International Rectifier GmbH in the County Court of Mannheim, Germany. The
lawsuit charged International Rectifier with infringing at least two of IXYS'
German patents. These patents cover key design features of IXYS' proprietary
integrated power module technology, which the lawsuit alleged International
Rectifier had been infringing in products sold in Germany. The lawsuit sought
damages and an injunction prohibiting the continued infringement by
International Rectifier.

On March 23, 2001, a public hearing took place in Mannheim, Germany and
International Rectifier did not deny making use of the above patents. On April
27, 2001, the County Court of Mannheim rendered a judgment in IXYS' favor that
enjoined International Rectifier from marketing, utilizing, importing or
possessing two of IXYS' German patents, and imposed a fine of up to (EUR)
256,000 to the state or imprisonment of International Rectifier's managing
director for each violation of the injunction. In addition, International
Rectifier was ordered to disclose to IXYS information about its previous sales
activity, offers of sales, advertisements, production costs and profits
concerning the infringed patents. International Rectifier was also ordered to
pay attorney fees and past and future damages and unjustified enrichment
resulting from International Rectifier's infringing practices, as calculated by
the information to be provided to IXYS by International Rectifier. International
Rectifier appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe. A hearing
on this appeal was held in March and the Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe ruled in
favor of IXYS. Notwithstanding this appeal, IXYS had begun enforcing the
judgment of the County Court of Mannheim; in order to do so IXYS was required to
pay (EUR) 532,000 as a form of bond to be held by the County Court of Mannheim.
Although International has a right to appeal the ruling of the Appeals Court in
Karlsruhe, the bond may be returned to IXYS and IXYS may continue to enforce the
judgment of the County Court of Mannheim. International Rectifier has also begun
to disclose information to IXYS pursuant to the judgment. While IXYS believes
that it would prevail were International Rectifier to appeal the ruling of the
Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe, there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome.
Were the ruling by the Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe overturned, IXYS does not
believe such an event would have a significant negative impact on the results of
operations, financial performance or liquidity of IXYS.

On February 8, 2001, IXYS filed a lawsuit against International Rectifier Italia
S.p.A. in the Civil Court of Monza, Italy, for patent infringement of at least
two of IXYS' European patents, which correspond to the German patents involved
in the above-described legal proceeding in Germany. The lawsuit seeks the
seizure of semiconductor modules produced by International Rectifier that
infringe on IXYS' patents and an injunction against further production of such
modules by International Rectifier in Italy. At a hearing on March 8, 2001, the
judge rejected International Rectifier's arguments that the Monza tribunal was
not competent to hear the case and nominated an expert to comment on the
technical details of the alleged patent infringement. Following the scheduled
submission of technical writs by the parties in May 2001, the expert submitted
written comments in June 2001. On June 27, 2001, the Civil Court of Monza
rendered a preliminary injunction in IXYS' favor with respect to certain claims
of infringement by International Rectifier S.p.A. Under the terms of this
preliminary injunction, IXYS is permitted to seize, and International Rectifier
S.p.A. is prohibited from distributing, certain of the allegedly infringing
semiconductor modules. The injunction is an interlocutory measure that remains
in effect until there has been a judgment on the merits. The first hearing on
the merits of the law suit is scheduled for December 12, 2001. It could be as
long as several years before a judgment on the merits is rendered.

While IXYS believes its claims against International Rectifier are meritorious,
there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome. IXYS does not believe that an
adverse ruling by the Civil Court of Monza would have a significant negative
impact on the results of operations, financial performance or liquidity of IXYS.

PROPERTIES

IXYS' administrative, marketing, development and manufacturing facilities are
located in Santa Clara, California, Lampertheim, Germany and Chippenham,
England. The Santa Clara facility consists of approximately 20,000 square feet
under a lease that expires in January 31, 2004. IXYS has an option to extend the
lease for five years. The base rent under this lease is approximately $330,000
per year. The Lampertheim facility, which IXYS' owns, consists of approximately
170,000 square feet. The Chippenham facility consists of approximately 100,000
square feet under a lease that expires in 2022. The base rent under this lease
is approximately $327,000 per year. IXYS believes that its current facilities
will be adequate through at least fiscal year 2003 and that suitable additional
space will be available in the future as needed on commercially reasonably
terms.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER
31, 2000

Net Revenues. Net revenues in the nine month period ended December 31, 2001 were
$62.4 million, a 21.4% decrease from net revenues of $79.4 million in the nine
month period ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in net revenues in the nine
month period ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the respective period in
the prior fiscal year, is primarily related to approximately 12.1% decrease in
units shipped in the nine month period ended December 31, 2001, as compared to
the nine month period ended December 31, 2000, as well as an 8.3% decrease in
average selling prices across IXYS' product line in the three month period ended
December 31, 2001 and an approximately 10.5% decrease in average selling prices
across its product line in the nine month period ended December 31, 2001, as
compared to the respective periods in the prior fiscal year.

nine month period ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $29.1 million, or

decrease in margins in the nine month period ended December 31, 2001, as
compared to the respective period in the prior fiscal year, was primarily due a
10.5% decrease in average selling prices from the nine month period ended

net revenues, in the nine month period ended December 31, 2000. The absolute
