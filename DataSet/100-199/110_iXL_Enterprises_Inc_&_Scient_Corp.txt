      TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SCIENT CORPORATION

                A MERGER PROPOSAL -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

    iXL and Scient have agreed to combine in a merger of equals. We are
proposing this business combination because we expect a range of synergies to
result from the transaction and implementation of the combined company's
business plan, including a strong competitive platform, cost savings resulting
from consolidation of overhead and technology infrastructure, and an experienced
combined management team. The new corporation, in which former iXL stockholders
and former Scient stockholders will become new stockholders, will be named
Scient, Inc. (and is currently named India-Sierra Holdings, Inc.), and will own
the businesses and assets of iXL and Scient. The initial board of directors of
this new company, which we will refer to as Holdco, will be composed of three
members designated by iXL, three members designated by Scient and two members
who will be independent directors agreed to by iXL and Scient. Management of
Holdco will be comprised of executive officers from both iXL and Scient.

    When the merger is completed, iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock for each share they own and Scient common
stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock for each share they
own. As a result, former stockholders of iXL will hold approximately 50%, and
former stockholders of Scient will hold approximately 50%, of the outstanding
common stock of Holdco. Holdco intends to apply to list its common stock on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the current Scient symbol "SCNT."

    In connection with the merger, iXL and Scient also propose that Holdco adopt
the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to enable the conversion of certain
outstanding iXL stock options upon the merger and the grant of stock options to
employees and consultants of Holdco after the merger.

    The board of directors of each of iXL and Scient has determined that the
combination of iXL and Scient is advisable and fair to its stockholders, has
unanimously approved the merger and recommends that iXL and Scient stockholders
vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc.
2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Information about the merger and the equity
incentive plan is contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.
Stockholders owning shares representing approximately 34% of the voting power of
each of iXL and Scient have entered into voting agreements pursuant to which
they have agreed to vote their respective shares FOR adoption of the merger
agreement and the equity incentive plan. We urge you to read this document,
including the section describing risk factors that begins on page
[             ].

    The dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

              For iXL stockholders:                              For Scient stockholders:
              iXL Enterprises, Inc.                                 Scient Corporation
               Stockholder Meeting                                 Stockholder Meeting
      [         ], 2001 at [         ] a.m.               [         ], 2001 at [         ] a.m.

    Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as
possible to make sure that your shares are represented at the meeting. If you do
not vote, it will have the same effect as voting AGAINST adoption of the merger
agreement.

    We strongly support this combination of our companies and join with our
boards of directors in enthusiastically recommending that you vote FOR adoption
of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan.

                   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS

Q:   Why are iXL and Scient proposing the merger?

A:   Scient and iXL face significant challenges as a result of changes over the
     past year in the industries in which they operate. We are proposing the
     merger because we expect a range of synergies to result from the proposed
     business combination and implementation of the combined company's business
     plan, including a strong competitive platform, cost savings and economies
     of scale resulting from consolidation of overhead and technology
     infrastructure, and an experienced combined management team. We believe
     that the combined company will be much stronger than either iXL or Scient
     on its own.

Q:   Why are iXL and Scient proposing adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
     Incentive Plan?

A:   We believe that the grant of equity-based awards such as stock options is a
     highly effective way to align the interests of employees, directors and
     consultants of Holdco with those of stockholders and provides a
     cost-effective means of encouraging their contributions to the success of
     Holdco.

Q:   What will I receive in the merger?

A:   Stockholders of iXL and Scient will receive the following in the merger:

     - iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock
       for each share they own; and

     - Scient common stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common
       stock for each share they own.

Q:   What is Holdco?

A:   Holdco is a newly formed Delaware corporation which was organized by iXL
     and Scient to complete the business combination. Upon consummation of the
     merger, Holdco will be named Scient, Inc. and be a publicly traded holding
     company for the current iXL and Scient businesses.

Q:   What does my board of directors recommend?

A:   The board of directors of iXL recommends that its stockholders vote FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
     Equity Incentive Plan. The board of directors of Scient recommends that its
     stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of
     the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

Q:   Who is soliciting my proxy?

A:   iXL's board of directors is soliciting proxies from iXL's stockholders, and
     Scient's board of directors is soliciting proxies from Scient's
     stockholders.

Q:   What stockholder approvals are needed to approve the merger and the merger
     agreement?

A:   For iXL, a vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
     iXL's common stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement is required.

     For Scient, a vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
     of Scient's common stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement is required.

Q:   What stockholder approvals are needed to approve the Scient, Inc. 2001
     Equity Incentive Plan?

A:   For iXL, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by iXL
     stockholders regarding the equity incentive plan is required.

     For Scient, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by
     Scient stockholders regarding the equity incentive plan is required.

Q:   Have any significant stockholders agreed to vote for the proposals?

A:   Yes. Stockholders owning shares representing approximately 34% of the
     voting power of each of iXL and Scient have entered into voting agreements
     pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their respective shares FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive plan.

Q:   What do I need to do now?

A:   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
     joint proxy statement-prospectus, please respond by completing, signing and
     dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid
     envelope so your shares can be counted at the special meeting.

Q:   What if I don't vote?

A:   If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST
     adoption of the merger agreement and will not be counted with respect to
     the adoption of the equity incentive plan. If you respond and do not
     indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the equity incentive
     plan. If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same
     effect as a vote AGAINST adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:   Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card?

A:   Just send by mail a written revocation or a later-dated, completed and
     signed proxy card before the special meeting or simply attend the special
     meeting and vote in person. You cannot change your vote by facsimile, the
     Internet or telephone.

Q:   What do I do if my shares are held by my broker in its name?

A:   Your broker will vote your shares for you only if you instruct your broker
     how to vote for you. Your broker should mail information to you that will
     explain how to give it these instructions.

Q:   Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions on
     how to exchange your stock certificates for shares of Holdco common stock.
     Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:   Where will my shares of Holdco common stock be listed?

A:   It is a condition to the merger that the shares of Holdco common stock to
     be issued in the merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
     We intend to list Holdco common stock under the current Scient symbol
     "SCNT."

Q:   When will I receive my shares of Holdco common stock?

A:   After the business combination is completed you will receive 0.25 shares of
     Holdco common stock for each iXL share you own and 0.31 shares of Holdco
     common stock for each Scient share you own, promptly after we receive from
     you a properly completed letter of transmittal together with your stock
     certificates or, if you do not own any physical stock certificates,
     promptly after we receive your properly completed letter of transmittal and
     electronic transfer of your iXL common stock or Scient common stock, as
     applicable.

Q:   How will I know the merger has occurred?

A:   If the merger occurs, iXL and Scient will make a public announcement and
     you will receive notice of such fact by mail.

Q:   Will I receive dividends on my shares of Holdco common stock?

A:   Holdco does not currently intend to pay dividends on its common stock.

Q:   When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:   We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. We expect to
     complete the merger during the late fall of 2001.

Q:   Are there any important risks about the merger transaction that I should be
     aware of?

     to vote on the merger agreement and whether to vote, we encourage you to

     India-Sierra Holdings, Inc., which will be renamed Scient, Inc. upon the
completion of the merger, and which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus as "Holdco," is a newly formed corporation that has not, to
date, conducted any activities other than those incident to its formation, the
matters contemplated by the merger agreement and the preparation of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus. Upon completion of the

merger, iXL and Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. The
business of Holdco will be the combined businesses currently conducted by iXL
and Scient.

                   THE STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 54)

     To accomplish the combination of their businesses, iXL and Scient jointly
formed a new company, Holdco, with two subsidiaries, India Merger Sub, Inc. and
Sierra Merger Sub, Inc. At the time the merger is completed:

     - iXL will be merged into India Merger Sub, and India Merger Sub will be
       the surviving corporation; and

     - Sierra Merger Sub will be merged into Scient, and Scient will be the
       surviving corporation.

     As a result, iXL (through its successor corporation India Merger Sub) and
Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

     The organization of the companies before and after the merger is
illustrated on the following page.

Holdco common stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the
merger. A large portion of these options will be granted immediately following
the merger in order to provide important retention incentives for employees and
consultants.

                         TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 56)

     We have structured the merger so that iXL, Scient and their respective
stockholders who exchange their shares for shares of Holdco common stock will
not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in
connection with the merger, except for taxes payable because of cash received by
iXL and Scient stockholders instead of fractional shares.

                 OVERVIEW OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 59)

     Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.  Each of iXL's and Scient's
obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions, including those listed below:

     - the merger agreement must be adopted by both the iXL and Scient
       stockholders;

     - no law, injunction or order preventing the completion of the merger may
       be in effect;

     - any applicable waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws must expire or be
       terminated;

     - the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the merger must have
       been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market;

     - the registration statement in which this joint proxy statement-prospectus
       is contained must be declared effective by the SEC;

     - each of iXL and Scient must have complied with their respective covenants
       in the merger agreement;

     - each of iXL's and Scient's respective representations and warranties in
       the merger agreement must be true and correct; and

     - iXL must receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the merger
       relating to iXL will qualify as a tax-free reorganization, and Scient
       must receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the merger
       relating to Scient will qualify as a tax-free reorganization.

     Termination of the Merger Agreement.  iXL and Scient can jointly agree to
terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either company may also terminate
the merger agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed on or before December 31, 2001; this date may
       be extended to a date no earlier than March 31, 2002, if the registration
       statement in which this joint proxy statement-prospectus is contained has
       not yet been declared effective by the SEC;

     - government actions do not permit the completion of the merger;

     - either company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement
       at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders;

     - the board of directors of the other company withdraws or changes its
       recommendation that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger;

     - the other company violates its obligation to convene a meeting of its
       stockholders to consider the merger; or

     - the other company breaches its representations, warranties or covenants
       in the merger agreement in a material way.

     Termination Fees.  The merger agreement provides that in several
circumstances, iXL or Scient may be required to pay a termination fee to the
other party as described on pages 62 through 63.

     "No Solicitation" Provisions.  The merger agreement contains detailed
provisions prohibiting iXL and Scient from seeking an alternative transaction.
These "no solicitation" provisions prohibit iXL and Scient, as well as their
officers, directors, subsidiaries and representatives, from taking any action to
solicit an acquisition proposal as described on page 60. The merger agreement
does not, however, prohibit either party or its respective board of directors
from considering, and potentially recommending, an unsolicited bona fide written
acquisition proposal from a third party that the board of directors concludes in
good faith is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal as described on
pages 60 through 62.

     Accounting Treatment.  We intend to account for the merger under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations. iXL will be deemed the
purchaser in the merger for accounting purposes.

     Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger.  We will complete the merger
when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived
in accordance with the merger agreement. The merger will become effective when
we file certificates of merger with the State of Delaware. We expect to complete
the merger during the fall of 2001.

                        VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 66)

     iXL has entered into a voting agreement with certain Scient stockholders
who are parties to the agreement pursuant to which these Scient stockholders
have agreed to vote all their shares of Scient common stock FOR adoption of the
merger agreement and the equity incentive plan. As of the record date, these
stockholders owned shares representing approximately 34% of the voting power of
Scient capital stock entitled to vote at the Scient special meeting.

stockholders owned shares representing approximately 34% of the voting power of
iXL capital stock entitled to vote at the iXL special meeting.

             SCIENT, INC. 2001 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (SEE PAGE 66)

     The purpose of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is to promote
the long-term success of Holdco and the creation of stockholder value. The plan
will reserve for issuance of stock incentives to employees, directors and
consultants of Holdco a number of shares equal to 25% of the number of Holdco
Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger, as
adjusted each subsequent January 1 to a number of shares not to exceed 25% of
the number of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding on such date. All
employees, directors and consultants of Holdco and its subsidiaries will be
eligible to participate in the plan. The plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and stock units.

                SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

     The following tables present (1) selected historical financial data of iXL,
(2) selected historical financial data of Scient and (3) selected unaudited pro
forma combined financial data of Holdco, which reflects the proposed transaction
and assumes the purchase method of accounting.

     The selected historical financial data of iXL has been derived from the
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of iXL
for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2000 and
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000.

     The selected historical financial data of Scient has been derived from the
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Scient
for each of the years in the four-year period ended March 31, 2001 and the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. The historical information is only a summary,
and you should read it in conjunction with the historical financial statements
and related notes contained in the annual and quarterly reports for iXL and
Scient which have been included in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

     The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been derived
from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus and should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information and related notes. The balance sheet data contained in the selected
unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the merger as if it
occurred as of June 30, 2001. The statement of operations data contained in the
selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the merger
as if it occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. The selected
unaudited pro forma combined financial data is presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the operating results or
financial position that would have actually occurred if the merger had been in
effect on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial position of Holdco. The pro forma adjustments are
based on the information and assumptions available at the time of the printing
of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Although estimates are preliminary,
management does not believe the actual results will differ significantly.

     The following table sets forth certain historical per share data of iXL and
Scient and combined per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving
effect to the merger on a purchase basis of accounting, assuming that 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock are issued in exchange for one share of iXL common
stock in the merger and 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock are issued in
exchange for one share of Scient common stock in the merger. This data should be
read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data, the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial data, and the separate historical
financial statements of iXL and Scient and notes, all of which are included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The pro forma condensed
combined financial data are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
that would have been achieved had the business combination been consummated as
of the beginning of the periods presented and should not be construed as
representative of results for any future period.

(1) iXL began trading on June 3, 1999 and Scient began trading on May 24, 1999.
(2) The stock prices for the third quarter 2001 are as of August 15, 2001.

     On July 30, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public
announcement of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the last
reported sale prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market were $1.00 per share of iXL
common stock and $0.55 per share of Scient common stock. On August [  ], 2001,
the last reported sale prices on Nasdaq were $[  ] per share of iXL common stock
and $[  .  ] per share of Scient common stock.

     Because the exchange ratio is fixed, changes in the market prices of iXL
common stock and Scient common stock will affect the dollar value of the Holdco
common stock to be received by stockholders of iXL and Scient in the merger. iXL
stockholders and Scient stockholders are urged to obtain current market
quotations for iXL common stock and Scient common stock prior to their
respective special meetings.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors
in deciding whether to vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR
adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET PRICES OF YOUR SHARES OF IXL STOCK OR SCIENT STOCK MAY
CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE HOLDCO STOCK YOU RECEIVE TO BE LESS THAN IT WAS AT THE
TIME THE MERGER AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.

     In the merger, all shares of iXL common stock and Scient common stock will
be converted into shares of Holdco common stock. The number of shares of Holdco
common stock to be received for each share of iXL common stock and Scient common
stock, as applicable, was fixed when the merger agreement was signed, and there
will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either iXL common stock
or Scient common stock. Any change in the price of either iXL common stock or
Scient common stock will affect the value iXL stockholders and Scient
stockholders receive in the merger. iXL common stock and Scient common stock
have historically experienced significant volatility, and the value of the
shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger may go up or down as the
market price of iXL common stock or Scient common stock goes up or down. Stock
price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control
of iXL and Scient, including changes in their businesses, operations and
prospects, and general market and economic conditions. Neither iXL nor Scient is
permitted to terminate the merger or resolicit the vote of its stockholders
solely because of changes in the market price of either party's common stock.

     The prices of iXL common stock and Scient common stock just prior to the
effective time of the merger may vary from their prices on the date of this
joint proxy statement-prospectus and their prices on the dates of the special
meetings. Because the date the merger is completed will be later than the dates
of the special meetings, the prices of iXL common stock and Scient common stock
on the dates of the special meetings may not be indicative of their prices on
the date the merger is completed.

DIRECTORS OF IXL AND SCIENT WHO HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADOPT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE HOLDCO EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERESTS
THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OR IN ADDITION TO YOUR INTERESTS AS AN IXL OR SCIENT
STOCKHOLDER.

     A number of directors of iXL and a number of directors of Scient who have
recommended that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and FOR the
adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan have employment,
severance and other benefit arrangements that provide them with interests in the
merger that differ from and are in addition to your interests as iXL and Scient
stockholders. Following completion of the merger, Robert M. Howe, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Scient, will become Chairman of the Board of Holdco,
U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Chairman of the Board of iXL, will become Vice Chairman
of the Board of Holdco, Christopher M. Formant, President and Chief Executive
Officer and a director of iXL will become President and Chief Executive Officer
and a director of Holdco, Stephen A. Mucchetti, President and Chief Operating
Officer and a director of Scient, will become Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer and a director of Holdco, Eric Greenberg, Chairman Emeritus
and a director of Scient, will become a director of Holdco, and Frank K. Bynum,
Jr., a director of iXL, will become a director of Holdco.

     The receipt of compensation or other benefits in the merger, including the
grant of new options under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the
vesting of existing stock options and restricted stock awards or the
continuation of indemnification arrangements for current directors of iXL and
Scient following completion of the merger, may have influenced these directors
in making their recommendation that you vote FOR adoption of the merger
agreement and FOR the adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

             RISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF HOLDCO

HOLDCO MAY FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE OPERATIONS OF IXL AND SCIENT OR
REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Holdco to
realize over a reasonable period of time the anticipated growth opportunities
and synergies from combining the businesses of iXL with the businesses of
Scient. To realize the anticipated benefits of this combination, members of the
management team of Holdco must develop strategies and implement a business plan
that will:

     - effectively and efficiently integrate the operations, policies, and
       procedures of iXL and Scient;

     - effect a significant reduction in the costs of operating and managing the
       combined businesses; and

     - successfully retain and attract key employees of the combined businesses,
       including operating management and key technical personnel, during a
       period of transition and in light of the competitive employment market.

     If members of the management team of Holdco are not able to develop
strategies and implement a business plan that achieves these objectives in the
near future, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized. In
particular, anticipated growth in revenue, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or "EBITDA," and cash flow, may not be realized,
which would have an adverse impact on Holdco and the market price of shares of
Holdco common stock.

HOLDCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT ITS BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY TO THE REDUCTION IN
DEMAND FOR INTERNET CONSULTING SERVICES.

     The demand for Internet consulting services has been declining and is
continuing to do so. The average amount of time and corporate resources invested
to attempt to secure any given project or new client has been extended. It is
likely that demand for Internet consulting services will remain lower than
historical levels for the near future. iXL and Scient have experienced a
significant decline in revenues resulting from this decline in demand for their
services and believe the decline in demand and revenues was primarily due to:

     - a broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients have
       significantly tightened technology budgets;

     - increased competitive pressure from traditional management consulting,
       information technology services and Internet consulting service
       competitors; and

     - a lack of urgency by large companies to immediately fund large Internet
       projects.

     iXL and Scient are each attempting, and Holdco will continue to attempt, to
adapt their businesses and business processes to this evolving environment. If
Holdco fails to make its combined operations more cost effective or to
anticipate and adapt its overall business processes to the evolving marketplace,
its business will suffer a material adverse impact.

HOLDCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE SUFFICIENT COSTS TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.

     In response to diminished demand for Internet consulting services, each of
iXL and Scient has undertaken an extensive cost reduction effort. Further
reductions will occur in connection with the integration of the operations of
iXL and Scient into Holdco, particularly in consolidation of leased office
spaces and of corporate and management personnel.

     To date, the following significant steps have been taken in the course of
iXL's cost reduction efforts:

     - the reduction of iXL's workforce (through layoffs and voluntary
       resignations) to a current level of approximately 1,000 employees as of
       June 30, 2001 (a reduction of approximately 66% since June 30, 2000);

     - the closing of 14 offices and significant downsizing of several other
       office locations; currently iXL has seven principal offices in the
       following metropolitan areas: Atlanta, GA; Richmond, VA; Washington, DC;
       New York, NY; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and London, England; and

     - significant changes in iXL's executive management team effective February
       2001, including the hiring of Christopher M. Formant as iXL's new Chief
       Executive Officer and President.

     To date, the following significant actions have been taken in the course of
Scient's cost reduction efforts:

     - the reduction of Scient's workforce (through layoffs and voluntary
       resignations) to a current level of approximately 500 employees as of
       June 30, 2001 (a reduction of approximately 74% since June 30, 2000); and

     - the closing of 6 offices and significant downsizing of several other
       office locations; currently Scient has offices in the following
       metropolitan areas: New York, NY, Boston, MA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX,
       San Francisco, CA, and London, England, as well as affiliate offices in
       Paris, France, and Tokyo, Japan.

     After the merger, Holdco will be required to further reduce the size of its
workforce for the combined businesses, close more offices and reduce general and
administrative expenses if revenues remain at current levels or further decline,
or are otherwise insufficient in relation to its costs of operations. The
ability to generate revenues will be impaired to the extent operations have been
or will be reduced. In addition, if demand for our services increases in the
future, we may not be able to expand our operations, including hiring additional
employees, to meet this demand in a timely fashion or at all. If we cannot
increase our revenues in future periods, our financial results will be adversely
affected.

     As a result of office closings, each of iXL and Scient continues to pay for
office space that it is not currently using. In addition, Scient has committed
to future space that it does not expect to need under its current business
plans. Certain of these excess obligations, which extend for periods ranging
from 2 to 20 years, are secured by cash security deposits and/or letters of
credit issued under their respective senior credit facilities. These lease
obligations, including the deposits and letters of credit will represent a
significant portion of Holdco's operating expenses on an ongoing basis, and thus
may have a material impact on Holdco's liquidity and capital resources and
ability to borrow funds. Holdco's ability to sublease, assign, or otherwise
divest itself of its surplus office space for at least break-even rent could be
adversely affected by depressed real estate market conditions in the relevant
cities. Holdco's failure to dispose of its surplus office space and to recover
the security deposits and obtain the cancellation of the letters of credit may
have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial
condition.

     Additionally, iXL has received notification from the landlord of its
Atlanta headquarters that such landlord deems iXL to be in default of its lease.

HOLDCO HAS LIMITED CAPITAL AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF ITS
REVENUES DO NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS.

     Holdco's future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many
factors. While iXL and Scient believe Holdco will be able to budget effectively
and contain expenses, like iXL and Scient, Holdco may be less able to accurately
predict revenues.

     Holdco's pro forma cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June
30, 2001 totaled approximately $140.9 million. Holdco believes that existing
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with additional
liquidity or funds that may be available under credit facilities, will be
sufficient to meet anticipated needs for working capital and capital
expenditures for the foreseeable future.

     However, if revenues and operating cash flows do not meet expectations and
Holdco does not have the ability to borrow funds from its bank lenders or such
ability is limited, Holdco may need to raise additional funds, and we cannot be
certain that we will be able to obtain additional capital on commercially
favorable terms or at all. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on
commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to:

     - maintain existing offices or open new offices, in the United States or
       internationally, or create additional global business units;

     - hire, train and retain qualified employees;

     - respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements;
       or

     - pursue acquisition opportunities.

     Our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our operations
and financial condition.

     If Holdco raises additional funds through the issuance of equity,
equity-related or debt securities, such equity securities may have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to those of Holdco's common stock. Furthermore,
because of the expected low trading price of Holdco's common stock, commensurate
with the low trading prices of iXL's and Scient's common stock, the number of
shares of the new equity or equity-related securities that may be required to be
issued may cause Holdco stockholders to experience significant additional
dilution. In addition, the issuance of debt securities would increase Holdco's
total leverage which could further depress the price of Holdco's common stock.
Holdco cannot be certain that additional financing, or funds from asset sales,
would be available on acceptable terms if required. If these additional methods
of financing become necessary and are not available or Holdco is unable to raise
funds from the sale of assets, Holdco may need to dramatically change its
business plan or sell or merge its business.

THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR CLIENTS COULD HARM HOLDCO'S BUSINESS.

     For the three months ended June 30, 2001, approximately 62% of iXL's net
revenue was received from its top ten clients, and two of iXL's clients
comprised more than 23% of its net revenue. For the three months ended June 30,
2001, Scient's five largest clients accounted for approximately 49% of Scient's
net revenues, and two clients individually accounted for over 10% of Scient's
net revenues.

     Holdco expects to continue to derive a significant portion of revenues from
a limited number of clients. To the extent that any significant client uses less
services or terminates its relationship, revenues could decline substantially.
The volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from period
to period, and a significant client in one period may not use our services in a
subsequent period. To maintain existing significant clients, Holdco may need to
perform certain of its services at reduced rates. The loss of one or more major
clients, the failure to attract new clients on a timely basis, or a reduction in
revenue associated with existing or proposed customers would harm Holdco's
business and prospects.

OUR LACK OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CLIENTS MAKES OUR REVENUES DIFFICULT TO
PREDICT.

     iXL and Scient are generally retained on a project-by-project basis, rather
than under long-term contracts. As a result our revenues are difficult to
predict. Because we will budget and incur costs based on our expectations of
future revenues, our failure to anticipate our revenues accurately may seriously
harm our financial condition and results of operations.

     Although our goal is to provide the full range of our services to our
clients, like iXL and Scient, we will frequently be retained to design and
perform only discrete segments of work on an engagement-by-engagement basis.
Similarly, because large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages,
there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages
of a project or that the client will cancel or delay additional planned
projects. iXL's and Scient's existing clients can generally reduce the scope of
or cancel their use of our services without penalty and with little or no
notice. If a client defers, modifies or cancels an engagement or chooses not to
retain us for additional phases of a project, we may not be able to rapidly
redeploy our employees to other active areas of our operations and efficiently
utilize our work force,

which could harm our operating results. Our operating expenses are relatively
fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated
variations in the number or size of pending client projects.

IXL'S AND SCIENT'S LIMITED OPERATING HISTORIES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE
THEIR BUSINESSES.

     iXL's operations commenced in May 1996, and Scient commenced operations in
July 1997. Both companies have engaged in extensive cost elimination efforts
since September 2000. As a result, iXL and Scient have limited operating
histories on which you can base your evaluation of Holdco's business and
prospects. Holdco's business and prospects must be considered in light of the
risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in their early
stages of development. These risks are further amplified by the fact that Holdco
is operating in the new and rapidly evolving strategic Internet services market.
These risks and uncertainties include the following:

     - its business model and strategy have evolved and are continually being
       reviewed;

     - it may not be able to successfully implement its business model and
       strategy;

     - its management has not worked together for very long; and

     - it may not be able to attract and maintain executives and other
       employees.

     Holdco cannot be sure that it will be successful in meeting these
challenges and addressing these risks and uncertainties. If Holdco is unable to
do so, its business will not be successful and the value of your investment in
Holdco will decline.

EACH OF IXL AND SCIENT HAS AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, IS NOT CURRENTLY PROFITABLE
AND MAY INCUR FUTURE LOSSES AND HAS SUFFERED DECLINES IN REVENUES.

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL and Scient had accumulated deficits (or negative
retained earnings) of approximately $570.2 million, and $235.2 million,
respectively. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to required accounting
adjustments, Holdco will have an accumulated deficit of $570.2 million as of
June 30, 2001. Additionally, iXL's and Scient's revenue compositions have
changed substantially from inception. Scient's revenues for the quarter ended
June 30, 2001 declined 58% compared to its revenues for the quarter ended March
31, 2001. iXL's revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 declined
approximately 20% compared to its revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.
In addition, iXL's independent accountants have indicated that there is
substantial doubt about iXL's ability to continue as a going concern as a result
of iXL sustaining losses and negative cash flows from operations since iXL's
inception.

     As a result, Holdco may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in
a reasonable time period, or at all. If Holdco fails to achieve or sustain
profitability, the price of its common stock would likely be negatively
affected. If we attain profitability, our ability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards will be subject to yearly limitations.

FAILURE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS FOR CHANGES IN DEMAND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
FINANCIAL RESULTS.

     Our business requires substantial managerial attention to ensure that our
employees and offices operate at an appropriate level of productivity. Failure
to effectively manage the productivity and work quality of our employees and
offices and the corresponding market demand for our services could seriously
harm our operations and financial condition. For example, each of iXL and Scient
has undertaken an extensive cost reduction effort to reduce overcapacity in
geographic areas and markets where demand for its services did not support its
staffing levels. If we do not attain increases in net revenue levels and
productivity, our business, operating results and financial condition could be
seriously harmed.

     Holdco's personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to
support future operations. To accommodate changing client needs and other
project management requirements, Holdco will need to update, change and maintain
various internal systems to support the business and to hire, train and retain
the appropriate personnel to manage our operations. Holdco will also need to
integrate and improve financial and

management controls, reporting systems and operating systems. Holdco may
encounter difficulties in developing, maintaining, and implementing these and
other systems.

IF HOLDCO FAILS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS GROWTH COULD BE
LIMITED AND ITS COSTS COULD INCREASE.

     Historically, iXL and Scient have experienced significant employee
turnover. Holdco's future success and its ability to generate revenue will
depend in large part upon its ability to attract, train and retain additional
highly skilled executive-level management and creative, technical, consulting
and sales personnel. Holdco may not be able to retain qualified existing
employees or hire appropriate new personnel because:

     - competition for skilled personnel in the Internet consulting industry is
       intense;

     - the turnover rate in the Internet consulting industry is high;

     - recent restructurings by iXL and Scient and the associated reductions in
       work force size are viewed unfavorably; and

     - many iXL and Scient employees hold options with exercise prices above the
       current market price of iXL and Scient common stock and, therefore, these
       options do not represent an economic inducement for retention.

HOLDCO WILL DEPEND ON ITS KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL FOR ITS FUTURE SUCCESS.

     Holdco's success will depend largely on the skills of its key management
personnel. The loss of one or more of its key management personnel may
materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations.
Currently, its key management personnel are Robert M. Howe, Chairman of the
Board, U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Board, Christopher M.
Formant, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen A. Mucchetti,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Holdco cannot guarantee
that it will be able to replace any of these individuals in the event their
services become unavailable. In addition, if any of these key employees joins a
competitor or forms a competing company, some of our clients might choose to use
the services of that competitor or new company instead of our own.

HOLDCO'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IMPORTANT TO ITS
BUSINESS.

     Holdco cannot guarantee that the steps that have been taken to protect our
proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our
intellectual property. In addition, Holdco may not be able to detect
unauthorized use of its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to
enforce its rights. If third parties infringe or misappropriate Holdco's trade
secrets, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, its business
could be seriously harmed. In addition, protection of intellectual property in
many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the United States, so
as Holdco's business continues to expand into foreign countries, risks
associated with protecting intellectual property will increase.

     In addition, although Holdco believes that its proprietary rights do not
infringe the intellectual property rights of others, other parties may assert
infringement claims against Holdco or claim that it has violated their
intellectual property rights. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to
cover, or may exclude such claims. Such claims, even if not true, could result
in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management.

HOLDCO'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISK.

     iXL and Scient have limited experience in managing foreign offices and
limited experience in marketing services to clients operating in foreign
markets. They have generated only limited revenues from international
operations. There are risks inherent in conducting business on a global level,
including:

     - the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

     - potentially adverse tax consequences;

     - longer payment cycles than those in the United States;

     - local laws or regulations that may impact our operating results or
       financial condition, such as maximum working hour requirements, overtime
       laws or other labor or employment restrictions;

     - restrictions on the import and export of certain sensitive technologies,
       including data security and encryption technologies that we may use or
       other local laws or regulations impacting ecommerce, such as privacy and
       data exchange laws;

     - seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world,
       such as during the summer months in Europe;

     - changes in regulatory requirements which could raise the cost of doing
       business or even prevent doing business, or restrict the ability to
       remove funds or investments from a country;

     - changes in currency exchange rates, which could significantly decrease
       the profitability of operations where payment is in local currency;

     - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

     - difficulties in using equity incentives for employees, which we rely on
       but which are often less understood outside the United States; and

     - differences in business customs.

     We may be unable to continue to successfully market, sell, deliver and
support our services internationally. For example, iXL and Scient have closed
numerous international offices as part of recent restructurings because they
were unable to generate any significant revenues from such offices. If Holdco is
unable to conduct international operations successfully, its business, financial
condition and operating results could be seriously harmed.

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK.

     Most of iXL's and Scient's client engagements are performed on a
time-and-materials basis, rather than a fixed-price basis. However, from time to
time certain clients demand fixed-price arrangements. Fixed-price contracts
involve greater financial risk than time-and-materials engagements. iXL and
Scient have limited experience estimating costs for fixed-price engagements. If
Holdco fails to estimate costs on fixed-price contracts accurately or encounters
unexpected problems, its financial performance will be adversely affected. iXL
and Scient have in the past had to commit unanticipated resources to complete
some of their fixed-price projects, resulting in lower gross margins. Holdco may
experience similar situations in the future.

SOME CLIENTS DEMAND THAT WE AGREE NOT TO PERFORM SERVICES FOR THEIR COMPETITORS.

     iXL and Scient each have entered into certain contracts wherein they have
agreed not to perform services for competitors of their clients for limited
periods of time. These non-compete agreements reduce the number of our
prospective clients and the number of potential sources of revenue. In addition,
these agreements increase the significance of our client selection process
because many clients compete in markets where only a limited number of players
gain meaningful market share. If we agree not to perform services for a
particular client's competitors and our client fails to capture a significant
portion of its market, we are unlikely to receive future revenues in that
particular market.

HOLDCO MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL CLAIMS FOR DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SOLUTIONS
IT DEVELOPS.

     Many of the solutions Holdco develops are critical to the operations of its
clients' businesses. Any defects or errors in these solutions could result in,
among other things, the following:

     - the payment of a lesser amount of fees than that accrued in the course of
       a particular engagement;

     - delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reactions;

     - negative publicity;

     - additional expenditures to correct the problem; and

     - claims against Holdco.

     iXL's and Scient's standard contracts limit their damages arising from
negligent conduct in rendering services. We believe these limitations on damages
are enforceable but may be subject to a challenge in litigation and, if such a
challenge is successful, may not protect us from liability for damages. In
addition, large claims may not be adequately covered by insurance and may raise
our insurance costs.

OUR CLIENTS MAY BECOME UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY US IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR
SERVICES PERFORMED.

     We assume a certain level of credit risk with our clients in order to do
business. Conditions affecting any of our clients could cause them to become
unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for services we
have already provided them. In the past iXL and Scient have experienced
significant collection delays from certain clients, and we cannot predict
whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays. Where it
is not probable that a customer will be able to pay, as determined at the onset
of an engagement, revenue is not recognized under iXL and Scient revenue
recognition policies for these customers until cash is collected. However, in
certain circumstances where the customer's ability to pay has been determined to
be probable at the onset of the engagement but the customer's financial
condition has subsequently deteriorated, iXL and Scient may be unable to realize
payment for their services on a timely basis. In particular, as our client base
has shifted to larger enterprise clients with longer billing cycle times and/or
unpredictable budget processes, our collections cycle time, and problems in
collecting invoiced amounts have increased and may continue to increase in the
future. If one or more of our clients fails or refuses to pay us in a timely
manner or at all, or if we are unable to collect a number of large accounts
receivable, it could have a material adverse effect on Holdco's business,
operating results and financial condition.

     Some of our current and potential clients, particularly those clients
funded primarily by venture capital, need to raise additional funds in order to
continue their business and operations as planned. We cannot be certain that
these companies will be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms
or at all. As a result of an inability to raise necessary financing, some
clients may be unable to retain our services or to pay us for services we have
already provided them or they may terminate our services earlier than we expect,
any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and
operating results. In particular, some of our current and potential clients
funded by venture capital have recently encountered greater difficulty obtaining
needed financing and therefore have had difficulty in retaining our services and
in paying amounts owed for services provided.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP BRAND AWARENESS OF OUR SERVICES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

     An important element of our business strategy is to develop and maintain
widespread awareness of the Scient brand name on a global basis. Our brand may
be closely associated with the business success or failure of some of our
high-profile clients, many of whom are pursuing unproven business models in
competitive markets. As a result, the failure or difficulties of one of our
high-profile clients may damage our brand. Specifically, as disclosed above, our
business reputation has been negatively impacted by certain failures or problems
experienced by some of our clients in the recent past, whether or not these
failures, problems, or setbacks were caused by our work or were within our
control. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand name or incur
significant related expenses, our operating margins and growth may be impacted
adversely.

A FEW STOCKHOLDERS WILL OWN MUCH OF HOLDCO'S STOCK.

     Holdco's directors, executive officers and their affiliates will
beneficially own a significant minority of Holdco outstanding common stock. As a
result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant control over all
matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant

corporate transactions, such as acquisitions, and to block an unsolicited tender
offer. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of
delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium
over the then-current market price of our common stock.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF A MARKET FOR OUR SERVICES.

     We cannot be certain that a viable market for our services will be
sustainable. The broad economic slowdown has caused many of our customers and
potential customers to significantly reduce their technology spending and our
clients to stop or delay the use of our services. If a viable and sustainable
market for our services does not develop and/or if we do not accurately predict
trends in the market and respond to those trends by providing new services or
products, we may fail. Even if we develop new services or products, there can be
no guarantee that a market will exist for such services and products or that
such services and products will adequately respond to market trends. If we
invest resources to develop new services and products for which a market does
not develop, our business and operating results would be seriously harmed. Even
if the market for our services grows, it may not grow at an adequate pace, and
we may not be able to differentiate our services from those of our competitors.
If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors,
our revenues and operating margins may decline.

  RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKETS AND OWNERSHIP OF HOLDCO COMMON STOCK

YOU MAY ENCOUNTER VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE FOR HOLDCO'S COMMON STOCK.

     The trading price of iXL's and Scient's common stock has been, and it is
likely that the trading price of Holdco common stock will continue to be, highly
volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among others, factors
such as the following:

     - actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;

     - the addition or loss of affiliates or providers;

     - ability to hire and retain employees;

     - additions or departures of key personnel;

     - announcements of technological innovations, new products or services by
       Holdco or its competitors;

     - changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

     - conditions or trends in the Internet and online commerce industries;

     - changes in the market valuations of other Internet or online service
       companies;

     - announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
       ventures or capital commitments;

     - sales of Holdco common stock;

     - general market conditions; and

     - other events or factors, many of which are beyond Holdco's control.

     In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the market for Internet and technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad
market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect Holdco's stock
price, regardless of its operating performance. Further, the existing market for
its common stock may not be sustained. In such circumstances, it may be
difficult for shareholders to sell shares of its common stock at a price that is
attractive.

     The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the issuance
of stock options to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a number of
shares of Holdco common stock equal to 25% of the number

of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding immediately after the effective
time of the merger, as adjusted each subsequent January 1 to a number of shares
not to exceed 25% of the number of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding on
such date. As described in the section of this joint proxy statement-prospectus
which describes the plan, a large portion of these options will be granted
immediately following the merger in order to provide important retention
incentives for employees. This large number of options could have a significant
effect on the market price of Holdco stock and cause dilution to the earnings
per share of Holdco common stock.

POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS MAKE FINANCIAL FORECASTING
DIFFICULT AND COULD AFFECT THE TRADING PRICES OF HOLDCO'S COMMON STOCK.

     As a result of ongoing cost reduction programs, limited operating
histories, the fluctuations in demand for Internet consulting services, rapid
historical growth, numerous historical acquisitions and the emerging nature of
the markets in which iXL and Scient compete and Holdco will compete, iXL, Scient
and Holdco believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations
for preceding quarters are not necessarily meaningful. Also, it is difficult to
forecast quarterly results due to, among other things, the difficulty in
predicting the amount and timing of client expenditures, acquisitions and
employee utilization. iXL's, Scient's and Holdco's quarterly results of
operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of
factors, many of which are outside their control, including:

     - ability to obtain new and follow-on client engagements;

     - failure or delay by clients in paying invoiced fees and expenses;

     - ability to retain clients on a long-term basis;

     - the amount and timing of expenditures by clients on a global basis for
       Internet consulting services and variations in budget cycles of large
       enterprise clients;

     - costs related to the closing, opening, shrinking or expanding of branch
       offices;

     - employee utilization rates, including the ability to transition employees
       quickly from completed projects to new engagements;

     - changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;

     - ability to attract, train and retain skilled management, strategic,
       technical, design, sales, marketing and support professionals;

     - the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;
       and

     - ability to manage costs, including personnel costs and support services
       costs.

     You should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of
its future performance. When iXL, Scient, Holdco or their respective authorized
executives make forecasts or comments about anticipated or intended future
results, those statements are subject to, among other things, risks and
uncertainties noted in this paragraph and discussed in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

WE ARE AT RISK OF SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION DUE TO OUR EXPECTED STOCK
PRICE VOLATILITY.

     In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against companies, including iXL, following periods of volatility in the market
price of their securities. Please see the section entitled "iXL
Business -- Legal Proceedings" on page 81 of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus for a description of such litigation against iXL. Due to
the historical and projected volatility of the stock prices of iXL, Scient and
Holdco, we may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities
litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention
and resources, which could seriously harm our financial condition and operating
results.

OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LOSE ELIGIBILITY FOR TRADING ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET.

     Due to the recent downturn for Internet consultants, the bid price for
iXL's and Scient's common stock has declined substantially. On August 9, 2001,
Scient received a notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market that its common stock has
failed to maintain the requisite minimum bid price over a specified period as
required for continued listing on Nasdaq; Scient was provided with 90 calendar
days to regain compliance with this requirement or be delisted from trading. If
after the merger Holdco's common stock were to experience a similar decline in
its bid price, it is possible that in the future Holdco might lose its
eligibility under various tests for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Upon
such a loss of eligibility, it is likely that trading activity would decline
substantially, further depressing the trading price.

               RISKS RELATED TO THE INTERNET CONSULTING INDUSTRY

THE DEVELOPING MARKET FOR INTERNET CONSULTING SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF
ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERNET AS A BUSINESS MEDIUM WILL AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

     The market for Internet consulting services is relatively new and is
evolving rapidly. Future growth is dependent upon our ability to provide
Internet consulting services that are accepted by our existing and future
clients as an integral part of their business model. Demand and market
acceptance for recently introduced services are subject to a high level of
uncertainty. The level of demand and acceptance of strategic Internet services
is dependent upon a number of factors, including, among other things, the
following:

     - the growth in consumer access to and acceptance of new interactive
       technologies such as the Internet;

     - companies adopting Internet-based business models; and

     - the development of technologies that facilitate two-way communication
       between companies and targeted audiences.

     Significant issues concerning the commercial use of these technologies
include security, reliability, cost, ease of use and quality of service. These
issues remain unresolved and may inhibit the growth of Internet business
solutions that utilize these technologies. If the market for strategic Internet
services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, or if our
services do not achieve market acceptance, our business will not succeed and the
value of your investment in our common stock will decline.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE CONTINUOUS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN OUR
MARKET.

     Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to
technological advances. We may not be successful in responding quickly,
cost-effectively and sufficiently to these developments. If we are unable, for
technical, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner in response
to technological advances, we will not be able to compete effectively. In
addition, employee time allocated to responding to technological advances will
not be available for client engagements.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH RELATIVELY LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY.

     The market for our solutions and services is highly competitive and has
become more so with the general market decline in demand for our services. It is
also characterized by a growing number of companies that have introduced or
developed similar offerings. Our target market is rapidly evolving and is
subject to continuous technological changes. Additionally, there are relatively
low barriers of entry into our business. We currently have limited patented or
other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from
entering the Internet consulting market. As a result, our competitors may be
better positioned to address these developments and may react more favorably to
these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Existing and future competitors
may develop or offer solutions and services that provide significant
technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the
services we offer.

     We classify our competitors into several groups:

     - e-business solution providers;

     - strategic consulting firms;

     - large information technology consulting services providers; and

     - computer hardware and service vendors.

     Our primary competitors today are Sapient Corporation, Proxicom, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Dimension Data), Viant Corp., and smaller professional services
firms. In addition, the "Big Five" consulting firms as well as other large and
small services firms are now more involved in the Internet consulting services
arena. We also compete with professional services groups of computer equipment
companies such as IBM; outsourcing firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation
and Electronic Data Systems; and the in-house information technology, marketing
and design service departments of current and potential clients. These larger
firms may be better positioned than us to secure attractive client engagements,
and may also be better positioned to withstand any fluctuations in demand.

     Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories and relationships with clients; larger installed customer bases; and
significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations
resources than us. Competitors that have established relationships with large
companies but limited expertise in providing e-business solutions may
successfully use their client relationships to enter our target market or
prevent our penetration into their client accounts. We believe that due to the
low cost of entering our markets, competition will intensify and increase in the
future. This intense competition may limit our ability to become profitable or
result in the loss of market share. As a result, our competitors may be better
positioned to address developments in the industry or may react more effectively
to industry changes, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally,
because competition for Fortune 500 client accounts is significant, some clients
are demanding discounts and/or other preferred terms in their contracts. Our
unwillingness or inability to grant discounts in an effort to protect our profit
margins may impact our ability to attract and maintain these clients.

INCREASING GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

     We are affected not only by regulations applicable to businesses generally,
but also laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce.
Although there are currently few such laws and regulations, state, federal and
foreign governments may adopt a number of these laws and regulations. Any such
legislation or regulation could dampen the growth of the Internet and decrease
its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium. If such a decline
occurs, companies may decide in the future not to use our services to create an
electronic business channel. This decrease in the demand for our services would
seriously harm our business and operating results. Any new laws and regulations
may govern or restrict any of the following issues:

     - user privacy;

     - the pricing and taxation of goods and services offered over the Internet;

     - the content of websites;

     - consumer protection; and

     - the characteristics and quality of products and services offered over the
       Internet.

                STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This joint proxy
statement-prospectus contains such "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements relate to future events or Holdco's future financial performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
"may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes,"
"estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative
of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements include, but are
not limited to, statements regarding: the expected benefits of the merger such
as efficiencies, cost savings, market profile and financial strength, and the
competitive ability and position of the combined company. These statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause
Holdco's or its industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events
or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should
specifically consider various factors, including the inability to obtain, or
meet conditions imposed for, approvals for the business combination, failure of
the iXL or Scient stockholders to approve the mergers, the risk that iXL's and
Scient's businesses will not be coordinated and integrated successfully, and
disruption from the merger making it more difficult for Holdco to maintain
relationships with clients, lenders, employees, suppliers or other constituents.
These factors may cause Holdco's actual results to differ materially from any
forward-looking statement.

     Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. None of iXL, Scient or Holdco is under any obligation, and
each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

     All subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to iXL, Scient or
Holdco or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     The special meetings are being held so that stockholders of each of iXL and
Scient may consider and vote upon

     - a proposal to adopt a merger agreement between iXL and Scient pursuant to
       which iXL and Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of a new
       holding company that will be named Scient, Inc.;

     - a proposal to adopt the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to enable
       the conversion of certain outstanding iXL stock options upon the merger
       and the grant of stock options to employees and consultants of Holdco
       after the merger; and

     - any other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any
       adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

     If the stockholders of iXL and Scient adopt the merger agreement, upon
completion of the merger:

     - each outstanding share of iXL common stock will be converted into the
       right to receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock; and

     - each outstanding share of Scient common stock will be converted into the
       right to receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock.

STOCKHOLDER RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     iXL.  iXL's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[               ], 2001 as the record date for determination of iXL stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were [               ] shares of iXL common stock outstanding, held by
approximately [               ] holders of record.

     Scient.  Scient's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[               ], 2001 as the record date for determination of Scient
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the
record date, there were [               ] shares of Scient common stock
outstanding, held by approximately [               ] holders of record.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSALS

     iXL.  A majority of the outstanding shares of iXL common stock must be
represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the iXL
special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of iXL's common stock outstanding as of the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast by iXL stockholders is required to adopt the Scient, Inc.
2001 Equity Incentive Plan. At the iXL special meeting, each share of iXL common
stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the iXL
stockholders. As of the record date, iXL directors and executive officers and
their affiliates owned approximately [               ]% of the outstanding
shares of iXL common stock.

     Scient.  A majority of the outstanding shares of Scient common stock must
be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the
Scient special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Scient's common stock outstanding as of the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast by Scient stockholders is required to adopt the Scient,
Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. At the Scient special meeting, each share of
Scient common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to
the Scient stockholders. As of the record date, Scient directors and executive
officers and their affiliates owned approximately [               ]% of the
outstanding shares of Scient common stock.

PROXIES

     All shares of iXL common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received before or at the iXL special meeting and all shares of Scient common
stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the Scient
special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance
with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no instructions are
indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted FOR
adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to
indicate how to vote your shares.

     If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
abstained from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the iXL common stock
or Scient common stock represented by the proxy or voting instruction will be
considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum,
but will be considered as having been voted AGAINST the adoption of the merger
agreement. If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
abstained from voting on adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan, the iXL common stock or Scient common stock represented by the proxy or
voting instruction will be considered present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum, but the proxy will not be counted with respect
to adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. If your shares are
held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to
vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank
holding shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have
discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the proposals, the shares will be
considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum, but will be considered as having been voted AGAINST the adoption of the
merger agreement and will not be counted with respect to adoption of the Scient,
Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only
if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided
to you by your broker.

     Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of iXL's common stock outstanding on the record date and
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Scient's common stock
outstanding on the record date, abstentions, failures to vote and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST adoption of the merger
agreement.

     The iXL special meeting or the Scient special meeting may be adjourned or
postponed, including by their respective chairmen, to permit further
solicitation of proxies. No proxy voted AGAINST the adoption of the merger
agreement will be voted on any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special
meeting that is submitted to the stockholders for a vote.

     Neither iXL nor Scient expects that any matter other than adoption of the
merger agreement and the adoption of the Holdco equity incentive plan will be
brought before its special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly
presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their
judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld on
the proxy card.

     A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted
by:

     - notifying in writing the Secretary of iXL Enterprises, Inc. at 1600
       Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA 30309, if you are an iXL stockholder, or
       the Secretary of Scient Corporation at 860 Broadway, 3(rd) Floor, New
       York, NY 10003, if you are a Scient stockholder;

     - granting a subsequently dated proxy; or

     - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder
       of record.

     Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     iXL and Scient will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with
the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. iXL has
retained [               ] for a fee of $[               ] plus additional
charges related to telephone calls and other services, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. Scient has retained [               ], at an estimated
cost of $[               ] plus reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. iXL, Scient and their respective proxy solicitors will
also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of iXL or
Scient common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy
statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will
reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of
proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic
means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or
employees of iXL and Scient. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

     You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement-prospectus describes material
aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement and the voting
agreements. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of
the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy statement-prospectus
and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding
of the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In the fall of 2000, Internet-related professional services firms began to
experience significant declines in revenues and profits primarily due to (i) a
broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients significantly tightened
technology budgets, (ii) increased competitive pressure from traditional
management consulting, information technology services, and eBusiness service
competitors, and (iii) a lack of urgency by Global 2000 companies to fund large
eBusiness projects. These negative industry trends dramatically affected the
financial results and market capitalizations of iXL, Scient and their peer
firms.

     In response to these developments, both iXL and Scient engaged in a series
of restructurings to reduce employees and each closed several offices. Both
companies also conducted a comprehensive review of their respective strategic
alternatives, ranging from standalone strategies to sale transactions.

     In February 2001, Scient engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to assist it in
conducting a comprehensive review of its strategic alternatives. As part of its
engagement, in February and March 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners contacted over 30
entities to evaluate their interest in a possible transaction with Scient. Of
the entities contacted, only one party ("Party A") expressed an interest in
pursuing a transaction with Scient, and in March 2001, Scient's board of
directors determined to enter into preliminary negotiations with respect to a
sale of Scient to Party A. However, Scient and Party A were unable to reach
agreement on a transaction and ceased negotiations in April 2001.

     Following termination of these discussions, Scient's management and board
continued their consideration of strategic alternatives intended to ensure
Scient's long-term viability and success. Among other things, Scient's
management had extensive discussions with outside legal, financial and real
estate advisors regarding strategies involving Scient remaining an independent
company, including how Scient might address its long-term real estate
obligations. Scient management also spoke to a number of third parties to assess
their potential interest in a transaction with Scient.

     Beginning in February 2001 and continuing through June 2001,
representatives of iXL executive management conducted a series of meetings with
various investment bankers to discuss alternatives available to iXL, including
the identification of potential merger partners or buyers. iXL management
believed that consolidation of the Internet consulting industry was necessary
and sought to participate in the consolidation process. No investment bankers
were engaged at this time. Also during this period, representatives of iXL
executive management had numerous informal discussions with several of its
competitors, none of which ultimately led to any significant prospects for a
business combination transaction. The potential for a business combination
transaction was frequently discussed by iXL executive management and members of
the iXL board of directors.

     Beginning in early 2000, Robert M. Howe, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Scient, and U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Chairman of iXL, engaged in a
number of conversations to discuss a possible partnership or transaction between
iXL and Scient. In November 2000, Mr. Ellis telephoned Mr. Howe to discuss
various issues relating to a possible transaction between their companies.
During this call, Mr. Ellis suggested that consolidation in the industry was
inevitable and asked Mr. Howe if he would be open to considering a merger with
iXL. Mr. Howe indicated that such discussions were premature.

     In June 2001, Mr. Ellis called Mr. Howe to discuss the state of the
industry and the potential for a merger between iXL and Scient. The conversation
included a substantial amount of discussion as to how a merger could be
effected. Mr. Howe agreed to consider a potential merger and to discuss it with
some of Scient's board members.

     On July 10, 2001, Messrs. Ellis and Howe discussed high-level strategic and
financial details of a potential merger and agreed to meet in New York City on
July 12, 2001, with Stephen A. Mucchetti, Chief Operating Officer of Scient, and
Christopher M. Formant, President and Chief Executive Officer of iXL, to discuss
operational details of a potential merger. During this meeting, the group agreed
to meet again on the afternoon of July 13, 2001, to discuss further a potential
merger.

     During discussions on July 13, 2001, Messrs. Ellis, Formant, Howe, and
Mucchetti agreed that a merger was in the best interest of iXL and Scient, and
they also agreed to the basic financial terms of a merger and agreed upon many
operational and managerial issues relating to the merger, all of which were
subject to approval by both companies' boards of directors and the negotiation
of a definitive agreement. The group agreed to discuss the terms with the
individual members of their respective boards of directors, and if the
individual board members reacted favorably, the group would meet during the
following week with financial and legal advisors to negotiate a definitive
agreement. The companies executed a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement and each
began an independent due diligence review.

     On July 15, 2001, Messrs. Howe and Ellis talked via telephone, reporting
that the individual members of their respective board of directors reacted
positively to a potential merger and they agreed to proceed with discussions.

     On July 16, 2001, iXL retained First Union Securities, Inc. and Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation to provide financial advice to iXL and retained
Greenberg Traurig, LLP to provide legal representation.

     Scient retained Davis Polk & Wardwell on July 17, 2001 to provide legal
advice.

     On July 17, 2001, an enlarged staff of executives of each company and Kelso
& Company, a significant iXL stockholder, met to discuss possible structures and
terms for the proposed business combination of iXL and Scient. In attendance
were Mr. Ellis, Mr. Formant, Michael J. Casey, Chief Financial Officer of iXL,
Theodore W. Browne, II, General Counsel of iXL, Ronnie Brown, Vice President,
Corporate Operations of iXL, Mr. Howe, Mr. Mucchetti, and Michael Hand, Vice
President and Corporate Controller of Scient.

     The Scient board, which had discussed possible steps to address Scient's
significant financial challenges on numerous occasions during 2001, held a
regular telephonic meeting on July 18, 2001 to review thoroughly a range of
options potentially available to Scient. Among other things, Mr. Howe updated
the board on the discussions with iXL. The Scient board agreed with management
that a business combination with a third party like iXL on satisfactory terms
appeared to be the most attractive option for Scient and authorized management
to continue attempting to negotiate a transaction with iXL.

     On July 19, 2001, iXL delivered a first draft of the merger agreement to
Scient and its advisors. In the following days, the parties and their advisors
participated in meetings and telephone conversations to negotiate the terms of
the proposed transaction. The parties and their financial advisors, legal
advisors and accountants also continued to perform their due diligence reviews.

     On July 20, 2001, representatives of both companies, including legal
advisors, and Kelso & Company met to discuss possible structures and terms for
the proposed business combination of iXL and Scient.

     On July 23, 2001, meetings began at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell in
New York City with an enlarged staff of executives of each company as well as
representatives of each party's financial advisors and legal counsel. The
purpose of the meetings was to negotiate the details of a merger and to continue
due diligence efforts. In attendance were Mr. Ellis, Mr. Formant, Michael J.
Casey, Chief Financial Officer of iXL, Theodore W. Browne, II, General Counsel
of iXL, Ronnie Brown, Vice President, Corporate Operations of iXL, Mr. Howe, Mr.
Mucchetti, Michael Hand, Controller of Scient, Christina Bark, Associate General
Counsel of Scient, Robert Beck, Vice President and General Manager, Global
People of Scient, and representatives of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Davis Polk &
Wardwell, First Union Securities, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan
Stanley, and Thomas Weisel Partners.

     On July 24, 2001, the iXL board of directors held a special meeting via
telephonic conference call to discuss the merger. At this meeting, the board
reviewed the terms of the proposed transaction in conjunction with iXL's
management and legal advisors. The board was presented with the history and
terms of the

potential merger and the strategic implications of the transaction and key
issues raised by the due diligence process. The board received a legal analysis
by Greenberg Traurig, LLP with regard to the board's duties in evaluating the
transaction and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

     On July 26, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of the iXL board of
directors, iXL management updated the board on the status of the merger
negotiations.

     On July 26, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of the Scient board of
directors, the board reviewed the terms of the proposed transaction in
conjunction with Scient's management, Scient's financial advisors, and Scient's
legal advisors. Scient's real estate advisor, CB Richard Ellis, was also
available to answer any questions the board might have on real estate issues.
The board considered the presentation by Scient's management of the history and
terms of the transaction, the financial and strategic implications of the
transaction and key issues raised by the due diligence process. The board
received a financial analysis of the proposed transaction by Thomas Weisel
Partners. The board also considered the comments of Davis Polk & Wardwell on
both the board's duties in evaluating the transaction and the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and other transaction agreements. The board
requested a follow-up conversation to discuss the results of certain aspects of
Scient's due diligence review and instructed management to proceed with
negotiations with iXL on unresolved issues. On July 27, 2001, at two special
telephonic meetings of the Scient board of directors, the board received
additional information concerning certain iXL due diligence matters.

     On July 29 and 30, 2001, senior management of iXL and Scient and their
financial and legal advisors continued in their negotiations concerning the
terms of the proposed transaction.

     On July 30, 2001, the board of directors of iXL met via telephone
conference call to consider approving the proposed merger. At this meeting,
Messrs. Ellis, Formant, Casey, Browne and other members of management further
reviewed the transaction with the board, including the strategic reasons for the
proposed transaction, the principal terms of the proposed transaction, a
financial review of the proposed transaction, a review of Scient's financial
condition and business operations and the results of iXL's due diligence review.
iXL's legal counsel again discussed the board's fiduciary duties in considering
a strategic business combination and further discussed the terms of the merger
agreement and related documents. Representatives of First Union Securities, Inc.
and Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation presented a summary of their analyses
on the strategic rationale for and financial analyses related to the proposed
merger. Based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and
limitations set forth in its opinion, First Union Securities, Inc. delivered its
oral opinion (followed by its written opinion dated July 31, 2001) that the
ratio for exchanging shares of iXL common stock for shares of common stock of
Holdco contemplated by the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of iXL common stock. Upon completing deliberations, the
board of directors of iXL, by action of those present at the meeting,
unanimously approved the merger agreement and related agreements and the
transactions contemplated by those agreements, declared them advisable and
resolved to recommend that iXL's stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

     On July 30, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of Scient's board of
directors, the entire board reviewed the final proposed terms and conditions of
the transaction in conjunction with Scient's management and financial and legal
advisors. In connection with this review, the board also received the oral
opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners (followed by its written opinion dated July
31, 2001) as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration
to be received by Scient's stockholders. After due consideration, including
advice concerning their legal duties from Davis Polk & Wardwell, the board
unanimously approved the transaction and authorized the submission of the
transaction and the merger agreement to a vote of Scient's stockholders.

     On July 31, 2001, the parties executed definitive agreements in connection
with the transaction and issued a press release announcing the transaction.
Additionally, certain stockholders of iXL entered into a voting agreement with
Scient pursuant to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock
of iXL in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive
plan, and certain stockholders of Scient entered into a voting agreement with
iXL pursuant to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock of
Scient in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive
plan.

IXL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; IXL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, iXL's board of
directors consulted with iXL's management, as well as with iXL's financial
advisors, independent accountants and legal advisors, including its General
Counsel and representatives of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, outside counsel to iXL,
and considered the following factors, among others:

     - the opportunity to create an entity more effectively positioned to
       succeed in the challenging market environment for information technology
       and web consultancy service companies by combining Scient's strengths in
       strategy consulting and architect design expertise with iXL's
       competitively priced development and implementation skills, which will
       allow Holdco to provide a broader and deeper range of solutions that
       address the needs of the market;

     - the opportunity to create more stable client relationships and expand
       revenue opportunities through the combined company's improved ability to
       win comprehensive engagements, as opposed to engagements involving only a
       subset of a solution needed by a client;

     - the improved depth of expertise that will result from the combination of
       iXL's and Scient's existing vertical industry groups;

     - the opportunity for Holdco to obtain the services of key members of
       Scient's management team, including Robert M. Howe as Chairman and
       Stephen A. Mucchetti as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
       Officer;

     - the enhanced ability of the combined company to better leverage through
       higher utilization the benefits of iXL's access to low-cost offshore
       resources through HPS, a strategic partner of iXL;

     - the opportunity to capitalize on Scient's favorable brand equity;

     - the substantial cost savings that could be achieved through consolidation
       of technology infrastructure and corporate overhead, including
       consolidation of office space;

     - the exchange ratios being used in the merger and the resulting continuing
       50% ownership interest in Holdco by iXL's stockholders and the history of
       the negotiations between iXL and Scient;

     - the presentations made by senior members of iXL's management regarding
       the long-term strategic advantages of combining with Scient, operational
       aspects of the transaction, and the results of management's operational
       and legal due diligence review;

     - historical information concerning iXL's and Scient's respective
       businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
       management, competitive position and stock performance;

     - iXL management's view as to the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of iXL and Scient before and after giving
       effect to the merger based on management's due diligence and publicly
       available consensus earnings estimates;

     - the opportunities and alternatives available to iXL if the merger were
       not to be undertaken, including remaining independent, pursuing an
       acquisition of or business combination or joint venture with entities
       other than Scient and the conclusion that a combination with Scient is
       expected to yield greater long-term benefits and is more feasible than
       the alternatives;

     - the opinion of First Union Securities, Inc. (and limitations set forth in
       the opinion) that the exchange ratio of Holdco common stock for iXL
       common stock was fair, to the common stockholders of iXL, from a
       financial point of view, and the analysis underlying the opinion of First
       Union Securities, Inc.;

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the voting agreements,
       and the affiliate registration rights agreement, including the fact that
       the exchange ratios are fixed, the limitations on and coordination of the
       interim business operations of each of iXL and Scient, the conditions to
       consummation of the merger, the right of the parties to the merger
       agreement, under certain circumstances, to respond to, evaluate and
       negotiate with respect to other business combination

proposals, the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be
terminated and the size and impact of termination fees associated with a
termination;

     - the corporate governance arrangements for Holdco, including the board
       composition, designation of key senior management and the establishment
       of a transition team, which are designed to promote the continuity of
       management from each company and smooth integration of the businesses;

     - the expected non-taxable nature of the merger for U.S. federal income tax
       purposes;

     - the accounting treatment of the transaction as a "purchase" transaction
       and deemed acquisition by iXL;

     - the interests of the officers and directors of iXL and Scient in the
       merger, including the matters described under "-- Interests of Certain
       iXL Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," and the impact of
       the merger on iXL's stockholders, customers and employees;

     - the challenges of combining the businesses, assets and workforces of two
       companies and the risks of not achieving the expected operating
       efficiencies or growth; and

     - the risk that management focus and resources will be diverted from other
       strategic opportunities and from operational matters while working to
       implement the merger.

     The discussion above sets forth the material information and factors
considered by iXL's board in its consideration of the merger agreement. Members
of iXL's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of their knowledge
of iXL's business, the industry in which Scient and iXL operate and their
business judgment. In view of the wide variety of factors considered, the iXL
board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make specific assessments of,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. The determination to approve the
merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In
addition, individual members of iXL's board may have given different weight to
different factors.

     IXL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER WITH SCIENT AND UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF IXL AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. THE IXL BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF IXL VOTE FOR THE MERGER AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

SCIENT'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; SCIENT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, Scient's board of
directors consulted with Scient's management, as well as with Scient's financial
advisors, independent accountants, real estate advisors and legal advisors, and
considered the following factors, among others:

     - the opportunity to blend both companies' engineering and user experience
       skills and to combine Scient's strategy capabilities, which are based on
       its industry expertise, and its business/technical architectural design
       skills with iXL's on- and off-shore capabilities and vendor alliance
       program, allowing the combined company to compete more effectively for
       engagements by delivering fully integrated business solutions;

     - the opportunity for the combined company to obtain the services of key
       members of iXL's management team, including U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. as Vice
       Chairman and Christopher M. Formant as President and Chief Executive
       Officer;

     - the synergies that the combined company could realize through reductions
       in infrastructure costs, including consolidation of offices, and the fact
       that the combination would not result in any material increase in real
       estate obligations for Scient;

     - the enhanced ability of the combined company to recruit and retain
       colleagues;

     - the significant challenges facing Scient as an independent company as a
       result of, among other things, the dramatic decline in the demand for
       Scient's services over the past twelve months and the inability to
       anticipate its future project pipeline;

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information about Scient common stock and iXL
       common stock;

     - the exchange ratio negotiated with iXL and the implied premium
       represented by the exchange ratio, based on recent and historical market
       prices of Scient's common stock as of the date of the merger agreement,
       and how this premium compared to price premiums in recent comparable
       transactions involving Internet professional services companies;

     - the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
       termination fee payable to Scient or to iXL under specified circumstances
       and the ability of Scient to negotiate other unsolicited strategic
       transaction proposals if the Scient board of directors believes in good
       faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
       financial advisors, that any such other proposal would be reasonably
       likely to lead to a proposal that is more favorable to the Scient
       stockholders than the transaction with iXL;

     - the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners, based on and subject to the
       assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion,
       that the consideration to be received by Scient's stockholders was fair,
       from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Scient, and the
       analysis underlying the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners;

     - information and presentations by Scient's management and legal, financial
       and real estate advisors concerning the business, technology, services,
       operations, financial condition, organizational structure and competitive
       positions of Scient and iXL on both a historical and prospective basis;

     - the fact that in February and March 2001 Thomas Weisel Partners contacted
       over 30 different entities regarding a potential strategic transaction
       with Scient, that this process identified only one potentially interested
       party, Party A, and that Scient was unable to reach agreement with Party
       A on the terms of a transaction;

     - the proposed corporate governance arrangements for the combined company,
       which will have a board of directors comprised of three current members
       of Scient's board, three current members of iXL's board and two
       independent directors;

     - the terms and conditions of the voting agreements entered into by certain
       stockholders of Scient and iXL;

     - the interests of certain directors and executive officers of Scient that
       are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Scient's
       stockholders generally as described under "-- Interests of Certain Scient
       Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger";

     - the qualification of the merger as a reorganization that is tax-free to
       Scient's stockholders; and

     - the fact that the merger is subject to approval by stockholders of Scient
       and by stockholders of iXL.

     The discussion above sets forth the material information and factors
considered by Scient's board in its consideration of the merger agreement.
Members of Scient's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of their
knowledge of Scient's business, the industry in which Scient and iXL operate and
their business judgment. In view of the wide variety of factors considered, the
Scient board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make specific
assessments of, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination. The determination to
approve the merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a
whole. In addition, individual members of Scient's board may have given
different weight to different factors.

     SCIENT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND THE MERGER WITH IXL AND UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SCIENT AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. THE SCIENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF SCIENT VOTE FOR THE MERGER AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF IXL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Under an engagement letter dated July 23, 2001, First Union Securities,
Inc. has acted as iXL's financial advisor in connection with the merger. iXL
selected First Union Securities based on First Union Securities' experience,
expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with iXL's business. First Union
Securities is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     In connection with First Union Securities' engagement, the iXL board of
directors requested that First Union Securities evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of iXL common stock, of the iXL exchange
ratio set forth in the merger agreement. On July 30, 2001, at a meeting of iXL's
board of directors held to evaluate the merger agreement, First Union Securities
rendered an oral opinion to the board of directors, which opinion was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated July 31, 2001, to the effect that, as of
July 30, 2001, with respect to the oral opinion, and July 31, 2001, with respect
to the written opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
and limitations described in the written opinion, the iXL exchange ratio of 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock for each share of iXL common stock was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of iXL common stock.

     The full text of First Union Securities' written opinion dated July 31,
2001 to iXL's board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. HOLDERS OF IXL COMMON STOCK ARE ENCOURAGED
TO, AND SHOULD, READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. The summary of
First Union Securities' opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion.

     First Union Securities' opinion is addressed to iXL's board of directors
only and except for inclusion of the opinion in its entirety (and related
references thereto) in this joint proxy statement-prospectus as sent by iXL to
holders of iXL common stock in connection with the merger or in any filing made
by iXL or Holdco with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
governmental agency in connection with the merger, may not be referred to,
disclosed to any third party or used for any other purpose, without First Union
Securities' prior written consent. The opinion relates only to the fairness of
the iXL exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of iXL
common stock, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related
transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any of iXL's
stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger
agreement, or whether or not such stockholder should seek to exercise any
dissenters' or appraisals rights that may be available, and should not be relied
upon by any stockholder as such. In rendering its opinion, First Union
Securities has assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms
described in the draft merger agreement that it reviewed, without any waiver of
any material terms or conditions. First Union Securities' written opinion
addresses only the fairness of the iXL exchange ratio from a financial point of
view and does not address iXL's underlying business decision to effect the
merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
or the merits of the proposed merger relative to any alternative transaction or
business strategy that may be available to iXL.

     In arriving at its opinion, First Union Securities has, among other things:

     - Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the draft merger agreement
       dated July 30, 2001 and the final merger agreement;

     - Reviewed certain business, financial and other information, including
       financial forecasts, regarding iXL and Scient that was publicly available
       or furnished to it by members of iXL's or Scient's management teams, and
       has discussed with such management teams their respective company's
       business and prospects;

     - Considered certain financial data related to iXL and Scient and (i)
       compared that data with similar data for publicly held companies in
       businesses similar to those of iXL and Scient and (ii) compared iXL's and
       Scient's data relative to one another;

     - Reviewed certain pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company
       that were jointly prepared and furnished to it by members of iXL's and
       Scient's management teams and has discussed with such management teams
       the business and prospects of the combined company;

     - Considered the financial terms of certain other business combinations and
       other transactions which have recently been effected; and

     - Considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations as well as financial and economic and market criteria that
       First Union Securities deemed relevant.

     In connection with its review, First Union Securities has relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the foregoing financial and other information, and
has not assumed any responsibility for any independent verification of such
information. With respect to iXL's and Scient's financial forecasts and the pro
forma financial forecasts of the combined company, First Union Securities has
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best current
estimates and judgments of iXL's and Scient's management teams as to the future
financial performance of their respective companies and the combined company.
First Union Securities has discussed iXL's and Scient's financial forecasts and
the pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company with the respective
management teams of iXL and Scient, but First Union Securities assumes no
responsibility for and expresses no view as to iXL's or Scient's financial
forecasts, the pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company, or the
assumptions upon which any of them are based. Furthermore, in arriving at its
opinion, First Union Securities has not conducted any physical inspections of
the properties or facilities of iXL or Scient, and has not made any independent
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of iXL or Scient. In
addition, in arriving at its opinion, First Union Securities has reviewed
certain summary information regarding iXL's venture investment portfolio and,
with the permission of iXL's board of directors, has relied solely upon guidance
from iXL's management as to its value.

     First Union Securities' opinion was necessarily based upon economic,
market, financial and other conditions as they existed and were subject to
evaluation by First Union Securities on the date of the opinion, and the
information made available to First Union Securities as of that date. Events
occurring after July 31, 2001 could materially affect the assumptions used in
preparing the opinion. First Union Securities has not undertaken to and is not
obligated to affirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment on any events
occurring after the date its opinion was given.

     In preparing its opinion to iXL's board of directors, First Union
Securities performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including
those described below. The summary of First Union Securities' analyses described
below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying First Union
Securities' opinion.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, First Union
Securities made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor that it considered. Accordingly, First Union Securities
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion. In its analyses, First Union Securities
considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
iXL and Scient. No company, transaction or business used in First Union
Securities' analyses as a comparison is identical to iXL or Scient or the
merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not

entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involved complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other facts
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions being analyzed. The estimates
contained in First Union Securities' analyses and the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition,
analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, First Union Securities' analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. First Union Securities' opinion
and related financial analyses was only one of many factors considered by iXL's
board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of iXL's board of directors or its management with
respect to the merger or the iXL exchange ratio.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
First Union Securities in connection with the preparation of its opinion and
reviewed with iXL's board of directors at their meeting held on July 30, 2001.
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular
format. To fully understand First Union Securities' financial analyses, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do
not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of First Union Securities' financial analyses.

  Common Stock Trading History

     First Union Securities examined the historical closing prices of iXL and
Scient common stock from July 27, 2000 to July 27, 2001. iXL common stock
reached a high of $17.75 per share and a low of $0.75 per share, and Scient
common stock reached a high of $54.94 per share and a low of $0.58 per share.

  Relative Contribution Analysis

     First Union Securities analyzed the pro forma financial contribution of iXL
and Scient to the combined company, assuming consummation of the merger, based
on historical financial results and projections provided by iXL and Scient
management. First Union Securities calculated the implied ownership and the
implied iXL exchange ratio of the combined company based on these financial
contributions. The analysis showed, among other things, the following:

                                                           ------   ----   --------------

Market capitalization at 7/27/01.........................  30.2%    69.8%      0.341x
Latest quarter annualized revenues.......................  25.7%    74.3%      0.363x
2001 projected revenues..................................  30.9%    69.1%      0.337x
Net tangible assets at 6/30/01...........................  57.9%    42.1%      0.205x
Projected unrestricted cash at 9/30/01...................  96.5%    3.5%       0.017x

Unrestricted cash is defined as cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, less cash collateralizing letters of credit relating to real estate
commitments. First Union Securities noted that the iXL exchange ratio of 0.250x
contemplated in the merger agreement was within the range of iXL exchange ratios
implied by the relative contribution analysis.

  iXL Financial Analysis

     Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis:  First Union Securities
analyzed the enterprise values and corresponding trading multiples of selected
publicly traded companies in the IT Services industry that First Union
Securities believed were reasonably comparable to iXL. These comparable
companies included:

     - Digitas Inc.

     - DiamondCluster International, Inc.

     - eLoyalty Corporation

     - Inforte Corp.

     - KPMG Consulting, Inc.

     - Modem Media, Inc.

     - Razorfish, Inc.

     - Sapient Corporation

     - Scient Corporation

     - Viant Corporation

     In examining these comparable companies, First Union Securities calculated
the enterprise value of each company as a multiple of its respective: (a) latest
reported quarter annualized revenues, (b) projected calendar year 2001 revenues
and (c) projected calendar year 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company
is equal to the value of its fully diluted common equity plus debt and the
liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus cash and cash
equivalents. All historical data were derived from publicly available sources
and all projected data were obtained from research analysts' estimates. Trading
prices and equity values used in calculating the following ranges are as of July
27, 2001. All other data used in calculating enterprise value are as of the most
recent publicly available financial statements of each company. First Union
Securities' analysis of the comparable companies yielded the following
enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                 RANGE         MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            ----------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenue...........................  (1.70x) to 1.42x   0.61x
CY 2001 projected revenues..................................  (2.10x) to 1.49x   0.68x
CY 2002 projected revenues..................................  (2.98x) to 1.61x   0.62x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable companies to the historical and projected results for comparable
periods of iXL to derive an implied enterprise value range for iXL of $96.4
million to $100.0 million. First Union Securities then added the value of iXL's
cash and cash equivalents less debt, plus the estimated value of iXL's venture
portfolio interest to iXL's implied enterprise value range to arrive at an
implied equity value range for iXL of $128.2 million to $131.7 million. This
equates to an implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.32 to
$1.36, with a median implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.33.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis:  Using publicly available information,
First Union Securities analyzed the purchase prices and implied enterprise value
multiples in the following selected merger and acquisition transactions in the
IT Services industry (acquiror/target):

     - CIBER, Inc./Aris Corporation

     - eXcelon Corporation/C-bridge Internet Solutions, Inc.

     - Motient Corporation/Rare Medium Group, Inc.

     - Dimension Data Holdings plc/Proxicom, Inc.

     - International Business Machines Corporation/Mainspring, Inc.

     - Novell, Inc./Cambridge Technology Partners (Massachusetts), Inc.

     - Red Hat, Inc./Planning Technologies, Inc.

     - CGI Group Inc./IMRglobal Corp.

     - ICICI Infotech Inc./Command Systems, Inc.

     In examining these comparable transactions, First Union Securities
calculated the enterprise value of each target company as a multiple of its
respective (a) latest quarter annualized revenues, (b) 2001 projected revenues
and (c) projected 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company is equal to
the amount offered by an acquiror for a target company's fully diluted common
equity plus the value of debt and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock, if any, minus cash and cash equivalents. All historical data were derived
from publicly available sources and all projected data were obtained from
research analysts' estimates. First Union Securities' analysis of the comparable
transactions yielded the following enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                RANGE       MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            -------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenues..........................   0.3x to 2.4x   0.74x
2001 projected revenues.....................................   0.3x to 2.6x   0.63x
2002 projected revenues.....................................   0.2x to 2.1x   0.35x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable transactions to the historical and projected results for
comparable periods of iXL to derive an implied enterprise value range for iXL of
$54.4 million to $120.6 million. First Union Securities then added the value of
iXL's cash and cash equivalents less debt, plus the estimated value of iXL's
venture portfolio interest to iXL's implied enterprise value range to arrive at
an implied equity value range for iXL of $86.1 million to $152.3 million. This
equates to an implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $0.89 to
$1.57, with a median implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.25.

     Liquidation Value Analysis:  First Union Securities performed a liquidation
value analysis for iXL based upon certain assumed values of its assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 2001. In the analysis, First Union Securities
analyzed two scenarios. In the first scenario, First Union Securities assumed
the value of iXL's tangible assets to be 100% of book value with the exception
of its Property Plant and Equipment, which was assumed to be 50% of book value,
and cash, which was reduced by cash collateralizing certain outstanding letters
of credit. In addition, iXL's venture portfolio interest was assumed to be 100%
of the value estimated by iXL management. All liabilities were assumed to be
paid in full in the event of liquidation. In the second scenario, First Union
Securities analyzed salvage values for non-cash tangible assets, other than
iXL's venture portfolio interest, at 50% of the value assumed in the first
scenario while all liabilities were again assumed to be paid in full. This
analysis resulted in an equity value range for iXL of $3.8 million to $37.7
million, or $0.04 to $0.39 per fully diluted iXL share, with a median value of
$0.21 per fully diluted iXL share.

  Scient Financial Analysis

     - Inforte Corp.

     - iXL Enterprises, Inc.

     - KPMG Consulting, Inc.

     - Modem Media, Inc.

     - Razorfish, Inc.

and (c) projected calendar year 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company
is equal to the value of its fully diluted common equity plus debt and the
liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus cash and cash

prices and equity values used in calculating the following ranges are as of July
27, 2001. All other data used in calculating enterprise value are as of the most
recent publicly available financial statements of each company. First Union
Securities' analysis of the comparable companies yielded the following
enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                 RANGE         MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            ----------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenue...........................  (1.70x) to 1.42x   0.61x

CY 2002 projected revenues..................................  (2.98x) to 1.61x   0.62x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable companies to the historical and projected results for comparable
periods of Scient to derive an implied enterprise value range for Scient of
$40.9 million to $66.5 million. First Union Securities then added the value of
Scient's cash and cash equivalents less debt to Scient's implied enterprise
value range to arrive at an implied equity value range for Scient of $150.6
million to $176.2 million. This equates to an implied equity value per fully
diluted Scient share of $2.02 to $2.37, with a median implied equity value per
fully diluted Scient share of $2.06.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis:  Using publicly available information,
First Union Securities analyzed the purchase prices and implied enterprise value
multiples in the following selected merger and acquisition transactions in the
IT Services industry (acquiror/target):

     - CIBER, Inc./Aris Corporation

     - eXcelon Corporation/C-bridge Internet Solutions, Inc.

     - Motient Corporation/Rare Medium Group, Inc.

     - Dimension Data Holdings plc/Proxicom, Inc.

     - Red Hat, Inc./Planning Technologies, Inc.

     - CGI Group Inc./IMRglobal Corp.

     - ICICI Infotech Inc./Command Systems, Inc.

     In examining these comparable transactions, First Union Securities
calculated the enterprise value of each target company as a multiple of its
respective (a) latest quarter annualized revenues, (b) 2001 projected revenues
and (c) projected 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company is equal to
the amount offered by an acquiror for a target company's fully diluted common
equity plus the value of debt and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock, if any, minus cash and cash equivalents. All historical data were derived

from publicly available sources and all projected data were obtained from
research analyst estimates. First Union Securities' analysis of the comparable
transactions yielded the following enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                RANGE       MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            -------------   ------

2002 projected revenues.....................................   0.2x to 2.1x   0.35x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable transactions to the historical and projected results for
comparable periods of Scient to derive an implied enterprise value range for
Scient of $23.0 million to $80.2 million. First Union Securities then added the
value of Scient's cash and cash equivalents less debt to Scient's implied
enterprise value range to arrive at an implied equity value range for Scient of
$132.7 million to $189.9 million. This equates to an implied equity value per
fully diluted Scient share of $1.78 to $2.55, with a median implied equity value
per fully diluted Scient share of $2.01.

     Liquidation Value Analysis:  First Union Securities performed a liquidation
value analysis for Scient based upon certain assumed values of its assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 2001. In the analysis, First Union Securities
analyzed two scenarios. In the first scenario, First Union Securities assumed
the value of Scient's tangible assets to be 100% of book value with the
exception of its Property Plant and Equipment which was assumed to be 50% of
book value, and cash, which was reduced by cash collateralizing certain
outstanding letters of credit. All liabilities were assumed to be paid in full
in the event of liquidation. In the second scenario, First Union Securities
analyzed salvage values for non-cash tangible assets at 50% of the value assumed
in the first scenario while all liabilities were again assumed to be paid in
full. This analysis resulted in an equity value range for Scient of $63.3
million to $75.4 million, or $0.85 to $1.01 per fully diluted Scient share, with
a median value of $0.93 per fully diluted Scient share.

  Exchange Ratio Analysis

     From the valuation methodologies employed in the analyses described above,
First Union Securities derived a range of implied values for Holdco, the company
to be formed by the combination of iXL and Scient in the merger, for the purpose
of evaluating the iXL exchange ratio. First Union Securities established an
implied equity value range for iXL and Scient based on the median equity values
from each of the preceding valuation analyses, as follows:

                                                             LOW VALUE
                                                             PER SHARE    LOW EQUITY VALUE
                                                             ----------   -----------------

iXL........................................................    $0.21        $20.7 million
Scient.....................................................    $0.93        $69.3 million

                                                             HIGH VALUE
                                                             PER SHARE    HIGH EQUITY VALUE
                                                             ----------   -----------------

iXL........................................................    $1.33       $128.4 million
Scient.....................................................    $2.06       $152.9 million

     By combining the low iXL equity value with the high Scient equity value and
the high iXL equity value with the low Scient equity value, First Union
Securities established an implied value range for Holdco of $173.7 million to
$197.7 million. Applying the iXL exchange ratio of 0.250x and the Scient
exchange ratio of 0.310x to the iXL and Scient fully diluted shares outstanding,
respectively, First Union Securities calculated the number of fully diluted
Holdco shares to be issued in the merger which was used to derive the implied
value range per share of Holdco of $3.67 to $4.18.

     First Union Securities next compared the low and high iXL value per share
above to the respective implied Holdco value per share range to derive an
implied iXL exchange ratio for evaluation against the iXL exchange ratio
contemplated in the merger agreement of 0.250x, as shown in the table below:

                                                               LOW      HIGH
                                                              ------   ------

Implied iXL value per share.................................  $ 0.21   $ 1.33
Implied Holdco value per share..............................  $ 3.67   $ 4.18
Implied iXL exchange ratio..................................   0.058x   0.317x

     Pursuant to the terms of First Union Securities' engagement letter with
iXL, iXL has agreed to pay First Union Securities the following fees for its
financial advisory services in connection with the merger: (i) $400,000 upon its
delivery of a fairness opinion and (ii) $600,000 upon the consummation of the
merger. iXL also has agreed to reimburse First Union Securities for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel
and any other advisor retained by First Union Securities, and to indemnify First
Union Securities and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

     First Union Securities is an investment banking firm and an affiliate of
First Union Corporation. First Union Securities makes a market in iXL's common
stock, provides research coverage on iXL's common stock and has in the past
provided investment banking services to iXL. First Union National Bank, an
affiliate of First Union Securities, is currently a lender to iXL. In the
ordinary course of its business, First Union Securities and its affiliates may
actively trade or hold the securities of iXL or Scient, for our own account or
for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities. In addition, First Union Securities and
its affiliates (including First Union Corporation and its affiliates) may
maintain relationships with iXL and Scient.

OPINION OF SCIENT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Thomas Weisel Partners has acted as financial advisor to Scient in
connection with the merger. On July 30, 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners delivered
to the board of directors of Scient its oral opinion that, as of that date, the
consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view. Thomas
Weisel Partners then delivered its written opinion, dated July 31, 2001,
confirming its oral opinion. Scient did not impose any limitations on Thomas
Weisel Partners with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed
in rendering its opinion.

     The full text of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion is attached as Annex F
to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Stockholders of Scient are urged to,
and should, read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. We have, however,
included the following summary of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion.

     Thomas Weisel Partners has directed its opinion to the board of directors
of Scient. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to you as to how you
should vote with respect to the transaction. The opinion addresses only the
fairness of the consideration to shareholders of Scient from a financial point
of view. It does not address the relative merits of the merger or any
alternatives to the merger. Further, it does not address Scient's underlying
decision to proceed with or effect the merger. In furnishing its opinion, Thomas
Weisel Partners did not admit that it is an expert within the meaning of the
term "expert" as used in the Securities Act of 1933, nor did it admit that its
opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933. The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion includes statements to this
effect.

     In connection with its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect
       to Scient and iXL, including the consolidated financial statements for
       recent years and interim periods to June 30, 2001 and certain other
       relevant financial and operating data relating to Scient and iXL made
       available to Thomas Weisel Partners from published sources and from the
       internal records of both companies;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
       the voting agreements;

     - reviewed certain publicly available information concerning the trading
       of, and the trading market for, Scient's and iXL's common stock;

     - compared Scient and iXL from a financial point of view with other
       companies in the Internet Professional Services industry that Thomas
       Weisel Partners deemed to be relevant;

     - considered the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       selected recent business combinations of companies in the Internet
       Professional Services industry that Thomas Weisel Partners deemed to be
       comparable, in whole or in part, to the merger;

     - reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of Scient
       and iXL certain information of a business and financial nature regarding
       Scient and iXL, furnished to Thomas Weisel Partners by them, including
       financial forecasts and related assumptions for Scient and iXL;

     - made inquiries regarding and discussed the merger and the merger
       agreement and other matters related thereto with Scient's counsel; and

     - performed such other analyses and examinations as Thomas Weisel Partners
       deemed appropriate.

     In preparing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume any
obligation to independently verify the information referred to above. Instead,
with Scient's consent, Thomas Weisel Partners relied on the information being
accurate and complete in all material respects. Thomas Weisel Partners also made
the following assumptions, in each case with Scient's consent:

     - with respect to the financial forecasts for Scient and iXL described
       above, Thomas Weisel Partners assumed for purposes of its opinion, upon
       the advice of management of Scient and iXL, that (a) these forecasts
       (including, without limitation, forecasts relating to cost savings and
       operating synergies) have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
       the best available estimates and judgments of management of Scient and
       iXL at the time of preparation as to the future financial performance of
       Scient and iXL, and (b) these forecasts provided a reasonable basis upon
       which Thomas Weisel Partners could form its opinion;

     - that there have been no material changes in Scient's or iXL's assets,
       financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since
       the respective dates of their last financial statements made available to
       Thomas Weisel Partners;

     - that the transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in all
       respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
       the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and all other applicable federal and
       state statutes, rules and regulations;

     - that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be
       treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the United States
       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

     - that the transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms
       described in the merger agreement, without any further amendment thereto,
       and without any waiver by Scient of any of the conditions to any party's
       obligations thereunder.

In addition, for purposes of its opinion:

     - Thomas Weisel Partners relied on advice of Scient's independent
       accountants as to all financial reporting matters with respect to Scient,
       and Scient's independent counsel with respect to legal matters relating
       to the merger and the merger agreement; and

     - Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume responsibility for making an
       independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or
       liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Scient or iXL, nor was Thomas
       Weisel Partners furnished with any such appraisals.

     The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion was based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Thomas Weisel Partners as of, the date of its opinion.

Accordingly, although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, Thomas
Weisel Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion.

     The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners in connection with providing its opinion to
the board of directors of Scient. Some of the summaries of financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners, you should read the tables together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners.

     In connection with providing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners used two
approaches in measuring the implied market value of the consideration to be
received by shareholders of Scient pursuant to the merger. The first valuation
approach used by Thomas Weisel Partners was to take the sum of the market values
of Scient and iXL as of the date of the fairness opinion and to allocate 49% of
that sum as the implied consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient
in the merger. The second valuation approach used by Thomas Weisel Partners was
to value the consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient in the
merger based on the market value of iXL as of the date of the fairness opinion
multiplied by the implied Scient exchange ratio. These two approaches used by
Thomas Weisel Partners constituted the outside limits of the ranges discussed in
the analyses set forth below.

     Comparable Company Valuation Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated aggregate value, which Thomas
Weisel Partners defined as equity value plus debt less cash, as a multiple of
estimated revenue for companies in the Internet Professional Services industry
for calendar years 2001 through 2002. Thomas Weisel Partners believes that the
following 12 companies have operations similar to some of the operations of
Scient, but noted that none of these companies has the same management,
composition, size or combination of businesses as Scient: AGENCY.COM Ltd.; Braun
Consulting Inc.; Cysive Inc.; Digitas Inc.; Inforte Corp.; Lante Corporation;
Modem Media Inc.; Organic Inc.; Razorfish Inc.; Sapient Corp.; Tanning
Technology Corp; and Viant Corp.

     The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis:

AGGREGATE VALUE TO                                         LOW     MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH
- ------------------                                        -----    ----   ------   ----

2001 Estimated Revenues.................................  (1.99)x  0.25x   0.57x   1.59x
2002 Estimated Revenues.................................  (1.63)x  0.31x   0.50x   1.89x

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the range of the aggregate values of the
consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient in connection with the
merger implied ratios of Scient's aggregate value to (1) calendar year 2001
estimated revenues ranging from 0.36x to 0.77x and (2) calendar year 2002
estimated revenues ranging from 0.34x to 0.74x.

     While the comparable company valuation analysis compared Scient to 12
companies in the Internet Professional Services industry, Thomas Weisel Partners
did not include every company that could be deemed to be a participant in this
same industry or in the specific sectors of this industry.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated aggregate value as a multiple of
revenue for the last twelve months, or LTM, and for the next twelve months, or
NTM, in seven particularly comparable acquisitions of Internet Professional
Services companies that have been announced since February 21, 2001:

ANNOUNCEMENT DATE                  NAME OF ACQUIROR             NAME OF TARGET
- -----------------                  ----------------             --------------

June 14, 2001..................  CIBER                   ARIS Corp.
May 23, 2001...................  Excelon                 C-Bridge Internet Solutions
May 15, 2001...................  Motient Corporation     Rare Medium
May 7, 2001....................  Dimension Data          Proxicom
April 19, 2001.................  IBM (Global Services)   Mainspring
March 12, 2001.................  Novell                  Cambridge Technology Partners
February 21, 2001..............  CGI Group (Canada)      IMRglobal

     The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis and
the range of multiples implied by the proposed merger:

AGGREGATE VALUE TO:                               LOW    MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH     MERGER
- -------------------                               ----   ----   ------   ----   ----------

LTM Revenue.....................................  0.27x  0.95x   0.90x   1.87x  0.10x-0.22x
NTM Revenue.....................................  0.28x  0.92x   0.53x   2.45x  0.41x-0.88x

     No company or transaction used in the comparable company or comparable
transactions analyses is identical to Scient, iXL or the merger. Accordingly, an
analysis of the results of the foregoing is not mathematical; rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that
could affect the public trading value of the companies to which Scient, iXL and
the transaction are being compared.

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the consideration
paid in comparable U.S. acquisitions in the technology industry (excluding the
healthcare technology and manufacturing industries), involving an aggregate
value of $50-$150 million, announced between January 1, 1999 and July 16, 2001.
Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the premiums paid in these transactions over
the share price of the acquired company as of one day, one week and one month
prior to the announcement of the acquisition offer.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the share price of the
acquired company with respect to these technology transactions:

                                                          LOW     MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH
                                                         -----    ----   ------   -----

Premium One Day Prior to Announcement..................  (19.2)%  41.7%   28.5%   190.3%
Premium One Week Prior to Announcement.................  (47.5)%  55.3%   40.9%   322.3%
Premium One Month Prior to Announcement................  (55.1)%  67.8%   58.8%   298.1%

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the share price premium implied by the
merger as of one day prior to the date of Thomas Weisel Partners' analyses
ranged from 61.5% to 120.2%; the implied premium as of one week prior to the
date of Thomas Weisel Partners' analyses ranged from 53.6% to 109.4%; and the
implied premium as of one month prior to the date of Thomas Weisel Partners'
analyses ranged from (13.2%) to 18.3%.

     Contribution Analysis.  Based on public and other available information,
Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the estimated contribution of Scient to
estimated revenue and gross profit for fiscal years 2001 through 2002 for the
combined company.

     The following table shows the percentage contributions indicated by this
analysis:

TOTAL REVENUES
  2001 Projected............................................  31.0%
  2002 Projected............................................  29.7%
GROSS PROFIT
  2001 Projected............................................   9.1%
  2002 Projected............................................  25.0%

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the forecasted share ownership of the
combined company to be held by the stockholders of Scient was 49%.

     Liquidation Analysis.  Scient's management estimated that the per-share
amount that would be distributed to shareholders of Scient in the event of a
liquidation of Scient would be between $0.43 and $0.64 per share. Thomas Weisel
Partners noted that the per-share value implied by the merger ranged from $0.94
to $1.28 per share.

     The foregoing description is only a summary of the analyses and
examinations that Thomas Weisel Partners deems material to its opinion. It is
not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually
conducted by Thomas Weisel Partners. The preparation of a fairness opinion
necessarily is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Thomas Weisel Partners believes that its analyses and the summary set forth
above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
would create an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth
in its presentation to the board of directors of Scient. In addition, Thomas
Weisel Partners may have given various analyses more or less weight than other
analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in
the summary above is not meant to indicate that this analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis. Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view
of Thomas Weisel Partners with respect to the actual value of Scient.

     In performing its analyses, Thomas Weisel Partners made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Scient and
iXL. The analyses performed by Thomas Weisel Partners are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. These analyses
were prepared solely as part of the analysis performed by Thomas Weisel Partners
with respect to the financial fairness of the consideration to be received by
Scient's shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement, and were provided to the
board of directors of Scient in connection with the delivery of the Thomas
Weisel Partners opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at
which any securities may trade at any time in the future.

     As described above, Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion and presentation were
among the many factors that the board of directors of Scient took into
consideration in making its determination to approve, and to recommend that its
stockholders approve, the merger agreement and the Scient merger.

     Scient has agreed to pay Thomas Weisel Partners the following fees with
respect to the merger: (i) $400,000 upon its delivery of a fairness opinion and
(ii) $600,000 upon the consummation of the merger. Scient was aware of this fee
structure and took it into account in considering the Thomas Weisel Partners
opinion and in approving the transaction. Further, Scient has agreed to
reimburse Thomas Weisel Partners for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
to indemnify Thomas Weisel Partners, its affiliates, and their respective
partners, directors, officers, agents, consultants, employees and controlling
persons against specific liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

     Scient selected Thomas Weisel Partners to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger based on Thomas Weisel Partners' experience,
expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with Scient's business. Thomas
Weisel Partners is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged

in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, Thomas Weisel Partners actively trades the equity securities of Scient
for its own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in these securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN IXL DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of iXL to vote
FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan, stockholders of iXL should be aware that members of the
iXL board of directors and members of iXL's management team have agreements or
arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that differ from and
are in addition to those of iXL stockholders. The iXL board of directors was
aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the
merits of the merger and in determining to recommend to the stockholders of iXL

     All of the unvested iXL options issued under the 1996 Stock Option Plan or
the 1998 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan will terminate and be forfeited
immediately prior to the closing of the merger to the extent not exercised

replaced with options to purchase Holdco Common Stock at the closing of the
merger. All of the iXL options issued under the 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan

completion of the merger, Holdco will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of iXL and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities:

     - to the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement
       of expenses as of July 31, 2001, which is the date of the merger

the merger, Holdco will cause to be maintained, for a period of six years after
completion of the merger, the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by iXL, or

shall include and caused to be maintained in its certificate of incorporation
and bylaws after the completion of the merger provisions regarding elimination

the merger.

     The merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the merger,
Holdco will cause to be maintained, for a period of six years after completion
of the merger, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Scient, or policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous

to the insured, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the completion of the merger, although Holdco will not be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Scient for directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or, to the extent legally permissible, waived,
including the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of iXL and
Scient. The merger will become effective upon the filing of certificates of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

     We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
expect to complete the merger during the fall of 2001.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF IXL AND SCIENT STOCK

     Structure.  To accomplish the combination of their businesses, iXL and
Scient jointly formed a new company, Holdco, with two subsidiaries, India Merger
Sub and Sierra Merger Sub. At the time the merger is completed:

     - iXL will be merged into India Merger Sub, and India Merger Sub will be
       the surviving corporation; and

     - Scient Merger Sub will be merged into Scient, and Scient will be the
       surviving corporation.

     As a result, iXL (through its successor corporation India Merger Sub) and
Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

     Conversion of iXL and Scient Stock.  When the merger is completed:

     - iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock
       for each share they own; and

     - Scient common stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common
       stock for each share they own.

     The number of shares of Holdco stock issuable in the merger will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar event
with respect to the iXL common stock or Scient common stock effected between the
date of the merger agreement and the date of completion of the merger.

EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR HOLDCO STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering your iXL or Scient stock
certificates in exchange for statements indicating book-entry ownership of
Holdco common stock or, if requested, stock certificates. When you deliver your
iXL or Scient stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly
executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your stock
certificates will be canceled and you will receive statements indicating
book-entry ownership of Holdco common stock or, if requested, stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of Holdco stock to which you are entitled
under the merger agreement. iXL and Scient stockholders will receive payment in
cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdco common stock
which would have been otherwise issuable to them as a result of the merger.

     You should not submit your iXL or Scient stock certificates for exchange
until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

     You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Holdco common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
iXL or Scient stock certificates in exchange for Holdco stock certificates.

     If there is any dividend or other distribution on Holdco stock with a
record date after the date on which the merger is completed and a payment date
prior to the date you surrender your iXL or Scient stock certificates in
exchange for Holdco stock certificates, you will receive the dividend or
distribution with respect to the whole shares of Holdco stock issued to you
promptly after they are issued. If there is any dividend or other distribution
on Holdco stock with a record date after the date on which the merger is
completed and a payment date after the date you surrender your iXL or Scient
stock certificates in exchange for Holdco stock certificates, you will receive
the dividend or distribution with respect to the whole shares of Holdco stock
issued to you promptly after the payment date.

     Holdco will only issue a Holdco stock certificate or a check in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered iXL or
Scient stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent with
all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership
and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

TREATMENT OF IXL AND SCIENT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY BASED AWARDS

     iXL.  When the merger is completed:

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's Tessera 1995 Stock
       Option Plan shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent not exercised,
       provided that all unvested options under this plan shall accelerate and
       vest prior to the effective time of the merger;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's 1996 Stock Option
       Plan and 1998 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan shall terminate and be
       forfeited to the extent not exercised;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's 1999 Employee
       Stock Option Plan and 1999B Employee Stock Option Plan, whether or not
       then vested or exercisable, will automatically be exchanged for options
       to purchase the number of shares of Holdco common stock that is equal to
       the product of 0.25 multiplied by the number of shares of iXL common
       stock that would have been subject to the option before the merger,
       rounded down to the nearest whole share; the exercise price per share
       will be equal to the exercise price per share of iXL common stock subject
       to the option before the merger divided by 0.25; and

     - current iXL employees holding options issued under iXL's Tessera 1995
       Stock Option Plan or iXL's 1996 Stock Option Plan who will continue as
       employees of Holdco will receive options to purchase the number of shares
       of Holdco common stock that is equal to the product of 0.25 multiplied by
       the number of shares of iXL common stock that would have been subject to
       the option before the merger, rounded down to the nearest whole share;
       the exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per
       share of iXL common stock subject to the option before the merger divided
       by 0.25; the vesting schedules shall be identical to that of the
       forfeited iXL options as they existed immediately prior to the
       effectiveness of the merger.

     Scient.  When the merger is completed:

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 1997 Stock Plan
       will be cancelled in accordance with the plan, provided, however, all
       unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the merger;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 1999 Equity
       Incentive Plan will expire in accordance with the plan, provided,
       however, all unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the
       merger; and

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 2000 Stock Plan
       will expire in accordance with the plan, provided, however, that all
       unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the merger.

     Holdco.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the
issuance of stock options to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the

merger. A large portion of these options will be granted immediately following
the merger in order to provide important retention incentives for employees.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following summary discusses certain material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of iXL and Scient stock.

     For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder means:

     - a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or
       organized under the laws of the United States or any political
       subdivision thereof;

     - a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
       administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the
       authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or

     - an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income
       regardless of its source.

     This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions
currently in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The discussion assumes that iXL stockholders hold their iXL
common stock and will hold their Holdco common stock, and that Scient
stockholders hold their Scient common stock and will hold their Holdco common
stock, as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in
light of his, her or its personal investment circumstances or to stockholders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,
but not limited to:

     - insurance companies;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currency;

     - banks or trusts;

     - persons that hold their iXL common stock or Scient common stock as part
       of a straddle, a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale or
       conversion transaction;

     - persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

     - investors in pass-through entities;

     - stockholders who acquired their iXL common stock or Scient common stock
       through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or through a
       tax-qualified retirement plan; or

     - holders of options granted under any iXL or Scient benefit plan.

     Furthermore, this discussion does not consider the potential effects of any
state, local or foreign tax laws.

     The mergers have been structured to qualify as tax-free transactions under
the Internal Revenue Code. The obligations of Scient to consummate the merger of
Sierra Merger Sub, Inc. into Scient is conditioned on the receipt by Scient of
an opinion from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to Scient, that the merger
relating to Scient will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The obligations of iXL to consummate the merger of iXL
into India Merger Sub, Inc. is conditioned on the receipt by iXL of an opinion
from Greenberg Traurig, LLP, counsel to iXL, that the merger relating to iXL
will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts, and the parties do not intend to request a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the mergers. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge such conclusion
or that a court will not sustain such challenge. Such

opinions shall be based on certain facts, assumptions and representations set
forth or referenced in such opinions. Assuming the mergers qualify as
reorganizations, the material tax consequences are as follows.

     Tax Consequences to Scient Shareholders.  U.S. Holders of Scient common
stock will not recognize gain, income, or loss upon the receipt of Holdco common
stock in exchange for their shares of Scient common stock, except with respect
to cash received by U.S. Holders of Scient common stock in lieu of fractional
shares of Holdco common stock. The tax basis of the shares of Holdco common
stock will be equal to the tax basis of the U.S. Holder's Scient common stock
exchanged for that Holdco common stock, reduced by any amount allocable to the
fractional share interests in Holdco common stock for which cash is received.
The holding period of the shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger
by a U.S. Holder of Scient common stock will include the holding period of the
U.S. Holder's Scient common stock surrendered therefor.

     Tax Consequences to iXL Shareholders.  U.S. Holders of iXL common stock
will not recognize gain, income, or loss upon the receipt of Holdco common stock
in exchange for their shares of iXL common stock, except with respect to cash
received by U.S. Holders of iXL common stock in lieu of fractional shares of
Holdco common stock. The tax basis of the shares of Holdco common stock will be
equal to the tax basis of the U.S. Holder's iXL common stock exchanged for that
Holdco common stock, reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share
interests in Holdco common stock for which cash is received. The holding period
of the shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger by a U.S. Holder of
iXL common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. Holder's iXL common
stock surrendered therefor.

     Tax Consequences to Scient and iXL.  No gain, income, or loss will be
recognized by Scient or iXL pursuant to the mergers.

     Copies of these opinions are attached as exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the
registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part.
Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or
failure of any factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and
complete in all material respects, could affect the continuing validity of the
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, tax opinion and the Davis Polk & Wardwell tax opinion.

     Cash Instead of Fractional Shares.  The receipt of cash instead of a
fractional share of Holdco common stock by a U.S. Holder of iXL or Scient common
stock will result in taxable gain or loss to such U.S. Holder for U.S. federal
income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash
received by such U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the
fractional share as set forth above. The gain or loss will constitute capital
gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder's holding period is greater than 12 months as of the date of the merger.
For non-corporate U.S. Holders, this long-term capital gain generally will be
taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

     Backup Withholding.  Certain non-corporate iXL and Scient stockholders may
be subject to backup withholding on cash payments received instead of fractional
shares of Holdco capital stock. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to
an iXL or Scient stockholder who:

     - furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he,
       she or it is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9
       or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered
       to iXL and Scient stockholders following the date of completion of the
       merger;

     - provides a certification of foreign status on Form W-8 or successor form;
       or

     - is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

     The amount of backup withholding from a payment of cash instead of
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock will be allowed as a credit against
such U.S. Holder's federal tax liability and may entitle you to a refund,
provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

     Reporting Requirements.  A U.S. Holder of iXL common stock or Scient common
stock receiving Holdco common stock as a result of the merger may be required to
retain records related to such U.S.

Holder's iXL common stock and Scient common stock, as the case may be, and file
with its federal income tax return, a statement setting forth facts relating to
the merger.

     This summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are
contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, the summary does not address
any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the
merger. The summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction
other than the merger. Accordingly, each iXL and Scient stockholder is strongly
urged to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state,
local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to the holder.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     We intend to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations. iXL will be deemed the purchaser of Scient's business
for accounting purposes. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements."

REGULATORY MATTERS

     iXL and Scient are not aware of any governmental approvals or actions that
are required to complete the merger. iXL and Scient conduct operations in a
number of foreign countries, some of which have voluntary and/or post-merger
notification systems. Should any approval or action be required, iXL and Scient
currently plan to seek such approval or take such action. Failure to obtain such
approval or take such action is not anticipated to have a material effect on the
merger or on Holdco.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF IXL AND SCIENT

     The offer and sale of shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Holdco common stock
issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either iXL or Scient
at the time of the special meetings. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
the common control of either iXL or Scient and may include our executive
officers and directors, as well as our significant stockholders. Affiliates may
not sell their shares of Holdco common stock acquired in connection with the
merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     Holdco's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement-prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Holdco
common stock to be received by our affiliates in the merger; however, Holdco has
agreed to register the shares of stock received by affiliates in the merger
pursuant to a registration rights agreement. See "-- Registration Rights
Agreement."

NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LISTING OF HOLDCO COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     The merger agreement requires Holdco to use its best efforts to cause the
shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official notice of issuance,
before the completion of the merger. Each of iXL's and Scient's obligation to
complete the merger is subject to the condition that this approval is obtained.
See "-- The Merger Agreement."

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, iXL stockholders and Scient stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger because the common stock of each
of iXL and Scient is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the shares of common
stock of

Holdco which the stockholders of iXL and Scient will receive in the merger will
be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF IXL AND SCIENT COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, iXL common stock and Scient common stock will
each be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and will be deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

         and

     "Material Adverse Effect," when used in reference to any entity, means any
material adverse effect on:

     - the business, assets (including cash), financial performance, condition
       (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of such entity and its
       subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any event, change,
       circumstance or effect relating:

      -- to the economy or financial markets in general;

      -- in general to the industries in which such entity operates and not
         specifically relating to (or having the effect of specifically relating
         to or having a materially disproportionate effect (relative to most
         other industry participants) on) such entity; or

      -- to the actions taken by the transition and succession team to the
         extent and in the manner specified in the merger agreement; or

     - the ability of such entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by
       the merger agreement.

     No Other Transactions Involving iXL or Scient.  The merger agreement
contains detailed provisions prohibiting iXL and Scient from seeking an
alternative transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions, each of iXL
and Scient has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, officers or
directors, will not, and that it will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
its and its subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives, (including
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors) do
not, directly or indirectly:

     - initiate, solicit, induce, encourage or knowingly facilitate the making
       or receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, as described below; or

     - have any discussion with, or provide (by any medium) any material
       non-public information or data to, any person relating to an Acquisition
       Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition
       Proposal, or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
       Acquisition Proposal.

     "Acquisition Proposal" means, with respect to iXL or Scient, other than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer or proposal for, or
any indication of interest, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term
sheet or inquiry relating to:

     - a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
       combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
       transaction involving it or any of its significant subsidiaries;

     - any transfer, lease, assignment, exchange, purchase or sale of 15% or
       more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its subsidiaries) of
       such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

     - any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, any equity or
       voting debt securities of such party, which if consummated, would result
       in any person beneficially owning any securities representing 15% or more
       of the outstanding voting power of such party (or of the surviving,
       resulting or ultimate parent entity in such transaction) or any of its
       significant subsidiaries.

     However, the merger agreement does not prevent each of iXL and Scient or
their respective board of directors from engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with, or providing(by any medium) material, non-public data or
information to, any person in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal by that person, but if and only to the extent that:

     - its stockholders have not voted to adopt the merger agreement;

     - its Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with
       independent outside counsel and independent financial advisors that such
       Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
       Proposal (as described below);

     - prior to providing any information or data to any person in connection
       with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, its Board of Directors
       receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement having
       provisions that are customary in such agreements relative to proposed
       transactions such as the Acquisition Proposal, as advised by outside
       counsel, provided that if such confidentiality agreement contains
       provisions that are less restrictive than the comparable provision, or
       omits restrictive provisions, contained in the confidentiality agreement
       between iXL and Scient, then the confidentiality agreement between iXL
       and Scient will be deemed to be amended to contain the less restrictive
       provisions or to omit the restrictive provisions (as the case may be);
       and

     - prior to providing any material, non-public data or information or data
       to any person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
       person, such party notifies the other party promptly (and, in any case,
       within 24 hours) of inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
       information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
       sought to be initiated or continued with, such person or any of its
       representatives, indicating the name of the person and the material terms
       and conditions of any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals, term
       sheets or offers.

     "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made to iXL or
Scient, as the case may be,

     - regarding a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
       business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
       iXL or Scient as a result of which the person making the proposal or its
       stockholders would own a majority of the combined voting power of the
       entity surviving or resulting from the transaction, or its ultimate
       parent entity;

     - which is on terms which the board of directors of iXL or Scient, as the
       case may be, in good faith concludes, following receipt of the advice of
       its financial advisors and outside counsel, taking into account, among
       other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
       proposal and the person making the proposal would, if completed, result
       in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of iXL or
       Scient, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the
       merger; and

     - which provides that any requisite external financing is either then
       committed or otherwise funded and not subject to any material
       contingency.

     In addition, if either iXL or Scient makes a Change in Board
Recommendation, as defined below, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
then it will

     - provide immediate written notice to the other party of the Change in
       Board Recommendation specifying the identity of the person making the
       Acquisition Proposal, as well as the material terms of the Acquisition
       Proposal; and

     - postpone or delay its stockholders meeting to be held for the purpose of
       voting on the merger agreement for not less than five days after such
       written notice is provided to the other party.

     "Change in Board Recommendation" means, with respect to any party to the
merger agreement:

     - withdrawing, modifying or qualifying, or proposing to withdraw, modify or
       qualify, in any manner adverse to the other party to the merger
       agreement, the recommendation of that party's board of directors that its
       stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - taking any action or making any statement in connection with the special
       meeting of the stockholders of that party that is inconsistent with the
       recommendation of that party's board of directors.

     Each of iXL and Scient has agreed under the provisions of the merger
agreement that:

     - it will promptly keep the other party informed of the status and terms of
       any proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations covered by the "no
       solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement;

     - it will, and its officers, directors and representatives will,
       immediately cease and terminate any activities, discussions or
       negotiations existing as of July 31, 2001, the date of the merger
       agreement, with any parties conducted before that date with respect to
       any Acquisition Proposal;

     - it will promptly inform its directors, officers, key employees, agents
       and representatives of the obligations of the "no solicitation"
       provisions of the merger agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to
       obtain their express acknowledgment of the terms of the "no solicitation"
       provisions; and

     - it will not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition
       Proposal other than the merger between iXL and Scient.

     Nothing contained in the "no solicitation" provisions of the merger
agreement will:

     - permit iXL or Scient to terminate the merger agreement, except as
       specifically provided in the merger agreement; or

     - affect any other obligation of iXL or Scient under the merger agreement.

     Termination.  iXL and Scient can terminate the merger agreement by mutual
written consent at any time. Either company may also terminate the merger
agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed on or before December 31, 2001; however, this
       date may be extended to no earlier than March 31, 2002 if the
       registration statement of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus is
       a part has not yet been declared effective by the SEC, and neither
       company may terminate pursuant to this provision if its willful failure
       to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause
       of or resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed by such date;

     - any governmental entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
       taken any action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
       merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
       final and nonappealable, except that this right to terminate the merger
       agreement shall not be available to any party who has been the cause of
       such action;

     - either company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement
       at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders;

     - the board of directors of the other party fails to recommend that the
       stockholders of that party vote for the adoption of the merger agreement
       or effects a Change in Board Recommendation, whether or not permitted by
       the terms of the merger agreement;

     - the other party fails to notice and convene a special meeting of its
       stockholders to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - the other party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
       warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger
       agreement in such a way as to render the conditions to the completion of
       the merger relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties and
       the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants contained
       in the merger agreement incapable of being satisfied on or before
       December 31, 2001 or such later date agreed to by the parties as
       described above.

     Termination Fee.  The merger agreement entitles each of iXL and Scient to a
$7,500,000 termination fee from the other party if it terminates the merger
agreement because:

     - the board of directors of the other party shall have failed to recommend
       that its stockholders approve the merger, effected a Change in Board
       Recommendation, or failed to notice and convene a special meeting of its
       stockholders to vote on adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - the approval of the merger by the other party's stockholders is not
       obtained, if prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with
       respect to the other party has been publicly announced or otherwise
       communicated publicly to the senior management, representatives, board of
       directors or stockholders of the other party.

  Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.

     Transition Team.  The merger agreement requires iXL and Scient to
reasonably cooperate in the formation of a transition and succession team
comprised of an equal number of representatives of each of iXL and Scient for
the purpose of establishing goals and programs, and implementing same, in
furtherance of the long-term strategic prospects, goals and objectives of
Holdco. To be effective, any action undertaken by such transition and succession
team shall require the affirmative approval of at least one representative of
each of iXL and Scient.

     Restrictions on Conduct of Business.  Under the merger agreement, each of
iXL and Scient has agreed that, during the period before completion of the
merger, it will carry on its respective business in the usual, regular and
ordinary course in all material respects, in substantially the same manner as
previously conducted, and will use its reasonable best efforts to preserve
intact its present line of business, maintain its rights and franchises and
preserve its relationships with third parties to the end that its ongoing
business shall not be impaired in any material respect at the completion of the
merger. Each of iXL and Scient has also agreed that it will not, and it will not
permit any of its subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions, enter into any
new material line of business or incur or commit to any capital expenditures or
any obligations or liabilities in connection with such capital expenditures,
other than as previously disclosed to the other party or in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice.

     In addition to these agreements regarding the conduct of business
generally, each of iXL and Scient has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to
some specific restrictions relating to, among other things, the following:

     - the declaration or payment of dividends;

     - the alteration of share capital, including, among other things, stock
       splits, combinations or reclassifications;

     - the taking of actions that would prevent or impede the merger from
       qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
       Code;

     - compensation of directors, executive officers and key employees;

     - accounting policies and procedures;

     - entrance into agreements that limit or restrict, or after completion of
       the merger, could limit or restrict iXL, Scient or any of their
       subsidiaries or affiliates, including Holdco, from engaging or competing
       in any line of business or in any geographic area; and

     - actions that would result, or would reasonably be expected to result, in
       any of the conditions to the merger not being satisfied, or a material
       delay in the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the merger.

     Additional Agreements.  Each of iXL and Scient has agreed to cooperate with
each other and to use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all
things necessary, proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable
laws to complete the merger as soon as practicable after July 31, 2001, which is
the date of the merger agreement. Accordingly, each has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to:

     - as promptly as practicable, prepare and file all applications, notices,
       petitions, filings and other documents, and to obtain all consents,
       waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings,
       authorizations and clearances from any third party or any domestic or
       foreign governmental entity necessary to complete the merger; and

     - take all reasonable steps to obtain all necessary consents and required
       approvals, including those required under applicable antitrust laws.

     The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to, among other
things, the cooperation between iXL and Scient in the preparation of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus and additional agreements between them relating to
access to information, mutual notice of specified matters and public
announcements.

     Amendment, Extension and Waiver.  The merger agreement may be amended by
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the merger by the
stockholders of iXL and Scient has been obtained. After the stockholder
approvals have been obtained, however, no amendment may be made which by law or
in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market requires further
approval by the stockholders of iXL or Scient, as the case may be, without such
further approval. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing and
signed by each party.

     At any time before the completion of the merger, the parties may, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, to the extent
legally allowed:

     - extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
       acts of the other parties;

     - waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
       the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger
       agreement; and

     All extensions and waivers must be in writing and signed by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

     Expenses.  Whether or not the merger is completed, all expenses and fees
incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger will be paid by
the party incurring the expenses or fees, except:

     - if the merger is completed, Holdco shall pay, or cause to be paid, any
       and all expenses incurred by iXL and Scient; and

     - irrespective of whether the merger is consummated, iXL and Scient shall
       share equally:

registration under the Securities Act of the offer and sale of the common stock
held by such affiliates; provided, however, upon the existence of certain
circumstances, Holdco may delay a demand for registration for a specified
period. Each demand for registration must be made by affiliates holding at least
10% of the common stock held by all such affiliates. Additionally, if Holdco is
at any time eligible to register the common stock held by the affiliates on Form
S-3, then the affiliates shall be entitled to request that Holdco register their

certain limitations on the sale of their common stock in conjunction with a

SCIENT, INC. 2001 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

     The following summary of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the equity
incentive plan, which is incorporated by reference and attached as

Annex I to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. We urge you to read the full
text of such equity incentive plan.

     General.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to comply
with the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Holdco's board of directors believes that in order for Holdco to attract, retain
and reward valuable personnel it is important for Holdco to adopt a flexible,
long-term incentive plan.

     Purpose.  The purpose of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is to
promote the long-term success of Holdco and the creation of stockholder value by
encouraging employees, directors and consultants to focus on critical long-range
objectives, encouraging the attraction and retention of employees, directors and
consultants with exceptional qualifications and linking such individuals
directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership.

     Shares Available for Grants.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan
will reserve for issuance of stock incentives to employees, directors and
consultants of Holdco a number of shares equal to 25% of the number of Holdco
common stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger. In
addition, as of January 1 of each year, commencing with the year 2002, the
aggregate number of shares underlying awards which may be granted under the plan
will automatically increase by a number equal to the lesser of 8% of the total
number of Holdco common stock then outstanding or (b) 10 million; provided that
the number of shares of Holdco common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to
the plan does not exceed 25% of the number of Holdco common stock outstanding as
of such January 1.

     No participant may receive stock options and/or stock appreciation rights
in any calendar year that relate to more than [______] shares, except that a
newly hired employee may receive options and/or stock appreciation rights
covering up to [______] shares. If awards granted under the plan are forfeited
or otherwise terminated, then the shares subject to those awards will again
become available for issuance under the plan. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
aggregate number of shares of Holdco common stock that may be issued under the
plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options will be [______] and may not
be increased when shares of restricted stock or other awards are forfeited.

     Substitute awards granted in assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding awards previously granted by a company which Holdco or an affiliate
acquires or with which Holdco or an affiliate combines, will not reduce the
number of shares available for issuance the plan.

     Administration.  The Holdco compensation committee will administer the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. The committee will have complete
discretion to make all decisions relating to the interpretation and operation of
the plan. Specifically, the committee will have the discretion to select the
employees and consultants who are to receive options under the plan, determine
the type, number, vesting requirements and other features and conditions of such
options, interpret the plan and make all other decisions relating to the
operation of the plan. The committee will also be permitted to reprice
outstanding options and modify outstanding options in other ways. In addition,
the committee will have the authority within the plan limits to establish
sub-plans if required to be in compliance with non-U.S. laws.

     Eligibility.  All employees, directors and consultants of Holdco and its
affiliates will be eligible to participate in the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan; provided that incentive stock options will be limited to common
law employees of Holdco, a parent or a subsidiary.

     Types of Awards.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan provides for
the following types of awards: incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units.

     Terms of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.  An optionee who exercises
an incentive stock option may qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code. On the other hand, nonstatutory stock options
do not qualify for such favorable tax treatment. The exercise price for all
incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the plan
will be at least 100% of the fair market

value of Holdco common stock on the option grant date. The exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options may be as low as the par value of the underlying
shares of Holdco common stock.

     Optionees will be permitted to pay the exercise price by using cash; shares
of Holdco common stock that the optionee already owns; a full-recourse
promissory note, except that the par value of newly issued shares must be paid
in cash; an immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by
us; or a loan from a broker designated by us, secured by the option shares.

     Options and stock appreciation rights will vest at the time or times
determined by the compensation committee. In most cases, the options will vest
over the four-year period following the date of grant.

     Options will generally expire 10 years after they are granted, except that
they will generally expire earlier if the optionee's service terminates earlier.

     Restricted Shares and Stock Units.  Restricted shares may be awarded under
the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan in return for cash; a full-recourse
promissory note, except that the par value of newly issued shares must be paid
in cash; services already provided to Holdco; and in the case of treasury shares
only, services to be provided to Holdco in the future.

     Restricted shares and stock units vest at the time or times determined by
the Holdco compensation committee.

     Change in Control.  If a change in control of Holdco occurs, an option or
other award granted under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will
generally become fully vested, unless the surviving company assumes the option
or other award or replaces it with a comparable award. In addition, an option or
other award will ordinarily become vested in full -- even if it was assumed or
replaced -- if the participant is discharged within 12 months after the change
in control other than for cause. For this purpose, a participant is also treated
as having been discharged other than for cause if the participant resigns after
being asked to relocate, after suffering a reduction in compensation or after
being demoted.

     A change in control includes a merger of Holdco after which Holdco's
stockholders own 50% or less of the surviving company; a sale of all or
substantially all of Holdco's assets; a proxy contest that results in the
replacement of more than one-half of Holdco's directors over a 24-month period;
or an acquisition of 30% or more of Holdco's outstanding stock by any person or
group, other than a person related to Holdco, such as a holding company owned by
Holdco's stockholders.

     Automatic Grants to Non-Employee Directors.  The non-employee members of
Holdco's board of directors are eligible for automatic option grants under the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Each non-employee director will receive
options for 5,000 shares of Holdco common stock each calendar quarter. These
options will be exercisable immediately after the grant, and the option shares
will be fully vested from the outset. The exercise price of each non-employee
director's option will be equal to the fair market value of Holdco common stock
on the option grant date. A director will be able to pay the exercise price by
using cash, shares of common stock that the director already owns or an
immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by Holdco. The
non-employee directors' options will have a 10-year term, except that they will
expire one year after a director leaves the Holdco board, if earlier.

     Adjustment.  All share amounts under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan, including shares reserved for issuance and the maximum number of shares
covered by options or stock appreciation rights granted to any participant in a
calendar year, are subject to proportionate adjustment upon stock splits, stock
dividends and the like; provided, however, that the quarterly options for
non-employee directors of 5,000 shares are not subject to adjustment.

     Amendment or Termination.  The Holdco board of directors may amend or
terminate the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan at any time. If the board
amends the plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the
amendment unless applicable law requires it. The plan will continue in effect
for 10 years after the completion of the merger, unless the board decides to
terminate the plan earlier.

     New Plan Benefits.  Awards under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan are discretionary. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the
allocation of all of the benefits that will be received in the future by
participants in the plan. It is anticipated that following the completion of the
merger, the following options to purchase Holdco common stock will be granted
under the plan to the directors and officers of Holdco:

     Summary of Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of
Awards.  The following is the current, general U.S. federal income tax
consequences of awards that may be granted under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan. It is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all
possible tax consequences related to awards under the plan.

     Neither the participant nor Holdco will incur any federal tax consequences
as a result of the grant of an option or a stock appreciation right. The
participant will have no taxable income upon exercising an incentive stock
option (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply), and Holdco will
receive no deduction when an incentive stock option is exercised. Upon
exercising a nonstatutory stock option or a stock appreciation right, the
participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the "spread"
between the exercise price and the fair market value of Holdco common stock on
the date of exercise; Holdco will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction for the
same amount.

     The tax treatment of a disposition of shares acquired upon exercise of an
option depends on how long the shares have been held and on whether the shares
were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option or by exercising a
nonstatutory stock option. Holdco will not be entitled to a deduction in
connection with a disposition of option shares, except in the case of a
disposition of shares acquired under an incentive stock option before the
applicable holding periods have been satisfied.

     In the case of awards other than options and stock appreciation rights, the
participant will generally be taxed as ordinary income equal to the fair market
of the shares, cash or other property received. This tax will accrue at the time
of grant, except in the case of an award that is non-transferable and subject to
a risk of forfeiture. In that case, the tax may not accrue until lapse of at
least one of these restrictions, although the participant may elect to be taxed
at the time of grant. Subject to an exception discussed below under
"-- Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code," Holdco will be
entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income taxed to
the participant.

     Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Holdco
compensation committee intends that some awards under the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan should qualify as performance-based, as defined in Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) imposes a cap of $1 million
on the amount of tax deductions that an employer may take for compensation to
any particular

executive in a single year, but qualifying performance-based compensation
remains fully deductible regardless of its amount. Under the plan, options and
stock appreciation rights are intended to qualify as performance-based
compensation.

     By approving the plan, stockholders will also be approving the eligibility
of executive officers and others to participate in the plan and the per-person
limitations for performance-based awards. The plan imposes per-person
limitations so that a participant may not receive awards intended to qualify as
performance-based in excess of his or her annual limit. The annual limit has
been set above the committee's present anticipated award levels because Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code permits only downward discretionary
adjustments.

     A number of other requirements must be met in order for a particular
compensation to qualify as performance-based under Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code. There can be no assurances that compensation resulting
from awards granted under the plan intended to qualify as performance-based
will, in fact, be fully deductible under all circumstances. In addition, the
plan authorizes types of awards that will not qualify as performance-based.
Compensation paid as a result of these awards may be subject to the limitation
on deductibility under Section 162(m) if it and other non-performance-based
compensation paid to any named executive officer exceed $1 million in a given
year. The committee's policy will be to preserve corporate tax deductions
attributable to the compensation of executives while maintaining the flexibility
to approve, when appropriate, compensation arrangements which it deems to be in
the best interests of Holdco and its stockholders, but which may not always
qualify for full tax deductibility under Section 162(m).

     Stockholder approval of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is
being sought in order to qualify for certain regulatory and tax benefits under
Nasdaq Stock Market rules, Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Sections 162(m)
and 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. If stockholders do not approve the plan,
it will not be adopted.

     The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by iXL
stockholders and the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by
Scient stockholders are required to adopt the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are presented to illustrate the effects of the merger on the historical
financial position and operating results of iXL and Scient. iXL and Scient have
different fiscal years. iXL has a December 31 year-end while Scient has a March
31 year-end. It is anticipated that Holdco will have a December 31 year-end. The
twelve-month unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are
presented using iXL's results for the year ended December 31, 2000 and Scient's
results for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001. The interim period unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are presented using both
iXL's and Scient's results for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Therefore,
Scient's results for the three months ended March 31, 2001 are included in both
the twelve-month and interim unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements
of operations. Revenue and net loss for Scient for the three months ended March
31, 2001 were $27.1 million and $90.2 million, respectively.

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June
30, 2001 gives effect to the merger as if it occurred as of that date. The
following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give
effect to the merger as if it occurred as of January 1, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are
presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have actually occurred if
the merger had been in effect on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of Holdco. The pro
forma adjustments are based on the information and assumptions available at the
time of the printing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Although
estimates are preliminary, management does not believe the actual results will
differ significantly.

THE MERGER

     The merger will be structured as a stock-for-stock exchange and is
described under "The Merger -- Structure of the Merger and Conversion of iXL and
Scient Stock."

     As a result of the merger, it is anticipated that the former stockholders
of iXL will have an approximate 50% interest in Holdco and that the former
stockholders of Scient will have an approximate 50% interest in Holdco. The
merger is expected to be accounted for as an acquisition by iXL of Scient under
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, as covered by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations."

     Management expects that the strategic benefits of the merger will result in
cost saving opportunities for the combined company. Those opportunities include,
but are not limited to, the ability to reduce real estate lease costs and
administrative costs. However, such incremental cost savings have not been
reflected in the accompanying pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations of Holdco.

                   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1. The purchase price of the merger was based on the number of common
shares outstanding of Scient that would be converted into Holdco shares based
upon the agreed ratio as of July 31, 2001. Scient has options outstanding that
will vest and be available to exercise upon consummation of the merger. All
options not exercised by closing will be cancelled. A significant portion of the
Scient options outstanding are out of the money. While it is likely that those
options in the money at the time of the closing will be exercised, there is no
way to estimate the ultimate number of Holdco shares that will be issued in
conjunction with any exercised options. Because the number of options that will
ultimately be exercised cannot be determined at this time, no adjustment for the
possible increase in the purchase price of Scient due to increased number of
shares outstanding is included in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet
as of June 30, 2001. Management does not believe the effects resulting from any
differences in the final allocation of the purchase price will differ
significantly from the estimates used herein.

     The purchase price and allocation used in preparation of these pro forma
statements were computed as follows:

PURCHASE PRICE (IN THOUSANDS):
Cost of acquired entity.....................................  $62,513(a)
Acquisition expenses (estimated)............................    7,356(b)
                                                              -------
Total purchase price........................................  $69,869
                                                              =======
PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE (IN THOUSANDS):
Fair value of Scient net assets at June 30, 2001............  $73,543
Excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost of
  acquired entity...........................................   (3,674)(c)
                                                              -------
Total purchase price........................................  $69,869
                                                              =======

- ---------------

a. The cost of the acquired entity is based on the outstanding shares of Scient
   as of July 31, 2001. The number of shares has been converted to an equivalent
   number of iXL shares and valued based on the average closing stock price for
   the period two days prior and two days after the July 31, 2001 merger
   announcement.
b. Total transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the merger are
   estimated to be approximately $7.4 million. These costs are presented as an
   adjustment to accrued liabilities in the unaudited pro forma condensed
   combined balance sheet. These costs are related to legal, printing,
   accounting, financial advisory services and other expenses. Other expenses
   include approximately $1.2 million of exit costs to be incurred in connection
   with the merger, such as a reduction in workforce.
c. The $3.7 million amount represents the excess of fair value of net assets
   acquired over cost and has been reallocated to property and equipment through
   a pro forma adjustment, resulting in a decrease in the property and equipment
   balance in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and a decrease in
   depreciation expense in the pro forma condensed combined income statements.

     2. Pro forma adjustments to record the merger as of June 30, 2001 represent
an increase in common stock resulting from the issuance of Holdco shares offset
by the elimination of Scient's existing common stock and a corresponding
decrease in additional paid in capital and unearned compensation resulting from
the elimination of Scient's existing additional paid in capital and unearned
compensation, offset by the cost of the acquired entity in excess of the par
value of the common stock.

     3. The pro forma combined weighted average common shares outstanding amount
for all periods presented is based on the estimated number of shares outstanding
after iXL stockholders and Scient stockholders have received their respective
0.25 and 0.31 shares in Holdco. Scient has options outstanding that will vest
and be available to exercise upon consummation of the merger. Because the number
of options that will ultimately be exercised cannot be determined at this time,
no adjustment to weighted shares outstanding has been made.

     4. Certain financial statement balances of Scient have been reclassified to
conform with iXL's financial statement presentation.

                                  IXL BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     iXL is a leading business and technology consultancy that helps companies
utilize emerging technologies and business strategy designed to build stronger,
more profitable relationships with their customers and business partners. iXL
has 7 principal offices in the United States and Europe. iXL began operations in
May 1996, and since that time iXL has acquired a total of 38 companies.

     iXL's goal is to be the leader in providing unique e-business solutions for
Global 1000 companies and other corporate users of information technology. To
achieve its goal, iXL seeks to utilize a focused set of vertical market
capabilities and cost-effective development and implementation resources. iXL
intends to leverage and expand its industry expertise, capture and disseminate
knowledge and best practices, recruit, train and retain experienced
professionals, expand client relationships and leverage strategic alliances with
key technology companies.

     iXL derives its revenue from fees for services for the design and delivery
of e-business solutions. These solutions typically include Web-based
applications, many of which integrate with a client's existing computer systems.
These solutions can incorporate multiple capabilities, including business
strategy consulting; creative design; information architecture; software
engineering; project management; and audio, video and animation production. iXL
offers its services on a time and materials and fixed-price basis.

     iXL typically staffs engagements with a multi-disciplined team of
professionals including, for example, project managers, strategic consultants,
creative designers, information architects, industry experts and software
engineers. By assembling these multi-disciplined teams of professionals, iXL
provides comprehensive e-business solutions to its clients. iXL utilizes a
proprietary engagement methodology called iD5, which defines and delineates
business procedures and processes to take full advantage of best practices
developed throughout iXL. iD5 governs and directs all phases of project
management from initial engagement definition to final solutions delivery. The
goal of iD5 is to provide consistent procedures for all engagement phases by
encouraging the use of best practices, while providing clients with greater
clarity of expectations, regular progress reports and a higher degree of project
organization. iXL believes iD5 helps it achieve on-time and on-budget solutions,
capture best practices and leverage its industry expertise.

     iXL uses its extensive engineering capabilities to deliver complex
e-business solutions by employing proven technologies such as Java, XML, Perl,
CGI, C and C++. iXL has also entered into an agreement with HPS America, Inc.
Under this agreement, HPS will complement and supplement iXL's existing core
engineering capabilities with its expertise in e-commerce, Web technology, rapid
application development, re-engineering and migration, legacy system maintenance
and enterprise integration.

     iXL's growth and its ability to provide e-business services depend in large
part on iXL's ability to recruit, train and retain experienced professionals.
iXL's strategy is to expand its existing expertise by recruiting senior
professionals from major consulting firms, creative design firms, information
technology services firms and other e-business services companies. iXL maintains
an informal, team-driven and results-oriented culture that is attractive to
energetic, talented professionals and provides incentives for iXL employees
through a competitive compensation plan, equity ownership and our stock option
plans.

on new engagements, improving efficiency of implementation and reducing project
delivery times.

SERVICE LINES

     iXL has organized its solution delivery around six service lines: Business
to Employee, E-Commerce/ Core Engineering, Strategy, Enterprise Relationship
Management, E-Value Chain and User Experience.

  Strategy

     iXL offers its clients, leading national and multinational businesses, a
single source for the comprehensive range of solutions required to identify,
design, develop and deploy e-business solutions that complement or expand
conventional business processes. iXL's strategy services combine innovative
strategic thinking, creative design capabilities, change management and
technological expertise to identify and develop innovative solutions.

  Business to Employee

     iXL's B2E group currently has three primary offerings: Knowledge
Management, eLearning and eHR and Employee Portals. The focus for these
solutions is to increase employee productivity and effectiveness. Together,
these solutions provide the basis for a powerful differentiator for iXL in
developing and winning eValue and ERM opportunities, as well as large enterprise
client engagements.

     iXL's B2E group has been named the strategic services partner for Cisco's
E-Learning Eco-system. Through this partnership, iXL will work with Cisco to
provide reference architecture and set solutions built on Cisco technologies.
Together iXL and Cisco will offer a number of knowledge management and learning
tools for large-scale enterprise solutions, including:

     - a means for employees to update their skill sets and job knowledge;

     - an efficient channel for sharing and disseminating information;

     - content creation and reuse;

     - increased employee productivity and reduced operational costs; and

     - delivery technologies including interactive multimedia, content on
       demand, virtual classroom, learning management and streaming media.

  E-Commerce/Core Engineering

     iXL designs, develops and deploys sophisticated e-commerce applications for
bringing buyers and sellers together via the Internet. iXL has created a broad
range of e-commerce applications for its clients, ranging from online retail
sites to electronic procurement systems. iXL's strength in e-commerce lies in
its ability to integrate third-party software with a client's existing computing
and network infrastructure to create a robust e-commerce environment for the
client's customers and prospects. iXL's technology group utilizes a set of core
e-commerce enabling technologies from companies, including:

     - Microsoft and BEA, for e-commerce server;

     - Oracle, for database platform development; and

     - Compaq and Sun Microsystems, for computing platforms and networking
       products and services.

     iXL has created its own e-commerce applications for specific client needs.
iXL also works with many third-party software companies that have developed more
general applications for conducting different aspects of e-commerce, ranging
from security to online transaction payments processing. iXL's E-Commerce/Core
Engineering service line also features specialized skills in E-Globalization.
E-Globalization is the process that enables a company to deliver products and
services to customers internationally. iXL works with clients to prepare
Internet-related business strategies and processes to handle international
inquiries, orders and customer support. Technology internationalization is the
creation or modification of software code, or HTML, to support information
processing in multiple locales, languages, currencies, calendars and other
differing data types. iXL assists clients in assessing the readiness of their
technology systems for globalization and localization. Technology localization
is the adaptation of a product or service to the legal, cultural, linguistic and
technical requirements of a particular market.

  Enterprise Relationship Management

     iXL designs and develops sophisticated computer-based business information
management systems. These include database-driven web sites that help clients
manage their customer, supplier and vendor relationships more effectively and
provide secure database access. Some of these web sites also have the capacity
to recognize and profile the types of information a user is typically interested
in, and to provide that information automatically to the user during future
visits to the site. As part of its ERM capability, iXL develops intranets and
extranets, which enable iXL's clients to communicate with employees, customers,
suppliers and vendors, as well as to track and store critical business data and
other information.

  E-Value Chain

     iXL's e-Value Chain group designs, builds and manages integrated trading
partner communities. iXL works with clients to develop solutions that provide
the ability to create, manage, maintain and optimize relationships with their
partners and suppliers across the entire Value Chain. iXL's e-Value Chain
practice provides strategic analysis and solutions to clients including
strategy, demand planning and order management,

procurement, technology, marketplaces for trading communities and supply chain
transformation and optimization.

  User Experience

     iXL's User Experience group builds a customized bridge between every client
and its customers. iXL's User Experience team is composed of experts in creative
strategy, branding strategy, content strategy and management, design,
information architecture, site authoring and usability engineering. Excellence
in quality and innovation in delivery are iXL's dominant drivers, allowing each
customer a unique and compelling experience.

SALES AND MARKETING

     iXL's marketing department has overall responsibility for communications,
advertising, public relations and iXL's World Wide Web site. iXL's sales &
marketing activities are aligned with iXL's vertical industry groups.

     Industry-aligned sales and marketing professionals are responsible for
developing new business within each industry, targeting new clients and
supporting the growth of existing client relationships. iXL's sales approach is
consultative and involves industry and solution experts who understand the
client's specific business and technology issues. Senior client executives are
assigned to strategic accounts to support and expand follow-on business.

     iXL's sales and marketing strategy is to leverage its industry expertise,
engineering, and technology skills to attract new clients and expand the scope
of existing client relationships into broader engagements, and to create and
sustain preference and loyalty for the iXL brand as a leading provider of
e-business solutions and services.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND AFFILIATIONS

     iXL has entered into, and intends to continue entering into, strategic
alliances and affiliations with a select group of technology service providers.
The primary goals of iXL's strategic alliances and affiliations are:

     - to train and retain iXL's engineers, architects, creative talent and
       strategists;

     - to create or identify new revenue opportunities through referrals and the
       creation of new service offerings; and

     - to increase iXL's credibility and visibility in the marketplace by
       operating an industry-leading alliances program as well as collaborating
       with alliance partners in joint marketing efforts.

     iXL has established strategic affiliations with, among others, Cisco,
Compaq, EMC, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Sun Microsystems. These strategic
affiliations provide iXL early access to training, product support, tools, best
practices and technology for these core elements of IT infrastructure. iXL has
also established strategic alliances with companies offering technologies that
serve specific roles in the deployment or delivery of iXL services. These
alliances are arranged by portfolios that focus on a particular solution set or
service line. Some of the portfolios and representative alliance partner
companies include Art Technology Group, BEA, Blue Martini, BroadVision,
Documentum, Interwoven, Vignette, Epicentric, Epiphany, Kana, Siebel and Ariba.
The contracts governing the strategic affiliations and alliances generally do
not have long durations or minimum requirements. In addition, they are generally
terminable by iXL or the other party at will.

     iXL has also entered into an agreement with HPS America, Inc. This
agreement is intended to enable HPS to complement and supplement iXL's existing
core engineering capabilities with its expertise in e-commerce, web technology,
rapid application development re-engineering and migration, legacy system
maintenance and enterprise integration. HPS is a joint venture between HCL
Technologies Limited, India's largest information technology company, and Perot
Systems, the world's third largest IT outsourcing company. HPS will provide iXL
with preferred pricing, priority scheduling and customized capabilities via
SEI-CMM Level 5 iXL-dedicated facilities in Noida and Bangalore, India. HPS was
assessed enterprise-wide at Level 5 of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
developed by the Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University,
Pittsburgh, USA.

     The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a federally funded research and
development center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and operated by
Carnegie Mellon University. Only 20 of over 1,000 worldwide assessments have
been assessed at this level. The CMM for Software describes the principles and
practices underlying software process maturity and is intended to help software
organizations improve the maturity of their software processes in terms of an
evolutionary path from ad hoc, chaotic processes to mature, and disciplined
software processes. The CMM is organized into five maturity levels with Level 5
being the highest: (1) Initial; (2) Repeatable; (3) Defined; (4) Managed; and
(5) Optimizing. Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's
software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these
five levels. The key process areas at Level 5 cover the issues that both the
organization and the projects must address in order to implement continual,
measurable software process improvement.

TRADEMARKS

     iXL(TM), the iXL logo, Interactive Excellence(TM), Internet Excellence(TM),
iD5(TM) and the names of products and services offered by iXL are trademarks,
registered trademarks, service marks or registered service marks of iXL.

COMPETITION

     The market for iXL's solutions and services is highly competitive and
characterized by a growing number of companies that have introduced or developed
similar offerings. iXL's target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to
continuous technological changes. In addition, there are relatively low barriers
of entry into iXL's business. iXL currently has limited patented or other
proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering
the Internet consulting market. As a result, iXL's competitors may be better
positioned to address these developments and may react more favorably to these
changes, which could have a material adverse effect on iXL's business, results
of operations and financial condition. Existing and future competitors may
develop or offer solutions and services that provide significant technological,
creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services offered by
iXL.

     iXL classifies its competitors into several groups:

     - e-business solution providers;

     - strategic consulting firms;

     - large information technology consulting services providers; and

     - computer hardware and service vendors.

     iXL's primary competitors today are Sapient Corporation, Proxicom, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Dimension Data), Viant Corp. and smaller professional services
firms. In addition, the "Big Five" consulting firms as well as other large and
small services firms are now offering Internet consulting services. iXL also
competes with professional services groups of computer equipment companies such
as IBM, Computer Sciences Corporation and Electronic Data Systems. These larger
firms may be better positioned than iXL to secure attractive client engagements,
and may also be better positioned to withstand any fluctuations in demand. Many
of iXL's current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and
relationships with clients; larger installed customer bases; and significantly
greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than iXL.
Competitors that have established relationships with large companies but limited
expertise in providing e-business solutions may successfully use their client
relationships to enter iXL's target market or prevent iXL's penetration into
their client accounts. iXL believe that due to the relatively low cost of
entering iXL's markets, competition will intensify and increase in the future.
Many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     This intense competition may limit iXL's ability to become profitable or
result in the loss of market share. As a result, iXL's competitors may be better
positioned to address developments in the industry or may react more effectively
to industry changes, which could adversely affect iXL's business. Additionally,
because

competition for Global 1000 client accounts is significant, some clients are
demanding discounts and/or other preferred terms in their contracts. iXL's
unwillingness or inability to grant discounts in an effort to protect profit
margins may impact iXL's ability to attract or maintain these clients.

EMPLOYEES

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL had approximately 1,000 employees, including
approximately 795 professional services employees, 205 general and
administrative employees, and 75 sales and marketing employees. None of iXL's
employees is represented by a labor union. iXL has experienced no work stoppages
and believes its relationship with its employees is good.

PROPERTIES

     iXL's executive offices are located in Atlanta. Additionally, iXL leases
office space for its principal offices in the following metropolitan areas: New
York, NY; Chicago, IL; Boston, MA; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, VA; and London,
England. iXL has obligations under leases for several of iXL's recently closed
offices. iXL has sublet certain of this space and is currently working to sublet
or enter into lease termination agreements for the remaining space. Even if iXL
is able to sublet these offices, iXL will continue to be responsible for the
tenant obligations in the event of a default by iXL's subtenant.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On or about September 8, 2000, the first in a series of shareholder class
action complaints was filed against iXL and certain of its present and former
directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. Those cases were consolidated by Order dated January 23,
2001, and a consolidated amended class action complaint (Case No.
1:00-CV-2347-CC) was filed on March 27, 2001, naming only iXL as a defendant, on
behalf of a putative class of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired
securities of iXL between November 30, 1999 and September 1, 2000. The amended
complaint seeks damages based on general allegations of false and misleading
press releases and SEC filings concerning our business prospects and financial
statements. The amended complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Another complaint related to the
volatility in the market price of iXL's common stock was filed in Redwing Ltd.
v. iXL Enterprises, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:00-CV-29790HTW, United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against iXL and certain of
its present and former directors and officers. The Redwing complaint alleges
causes of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Sections 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, the Georgia Blue
Sky laws, as well as common law claims for breach of contract and negligent
misrepresentation. A second related complaint was filed in Next Century
Communications Corp. v. U. Bertram Ellis, Case No. 1:01-CF-0755-TWT, United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Next Century
complaint alleges fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary
duty. We have filed motions to dismiss the Redwing complaint. We have moved to
dismiss the class action amended complaint and the Next Century complaint. We
believe we have meritorious defenses to the allegations and intend to defend
these cases vigorously. In light of the nature of the litigation process, there
can be no assurance that iXL will not be constrained to consider reasonable
settlement opportunities or suffer an adverse result, either of which could have
a material adverse impact on iXL.

                  IXL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements relating to iXL's future financial performance, business strategy,
financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks.
iXL's actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by
these forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors,
including, but not limited to, iXL's current liquidity position and need for
additional financing, actions that iXL's lenders could take under the amended
credit facility, the success of iXL's restructuring efforts and other factors
contained in the risk factor disclosure set forth in "Risk Factors," above. The
forward-looking statements contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus
are made only as of the date hereof, and iXL undertakes no obligation to update
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
developments or otherwise.

OVERVIEW

     iXL is a leading business and technology consultancy that helps companies
utilize emerging technologies and business strategy designed to build stronger,
more profitable relationships with their customers and business partners. iXL
has 7 principal offices in the United States and Europe. iXL began operations in
May 1996, and since that time iXL has acquired a total of 38 companies.

     iXL's goal is to be the leader in providing unique e-business solutions for
Global 1000 companies and other corporate users of information technology. To
achieve its goal, iXL seeks to utilize a focused set of vertical market
capabilities and cost-effective development and implementation resources. iXL
intends to leverage and expand its industry expertise, capture and disseminate
knowledge and best practices, recruit, train and retain experienced
professionals, expand client relationships and leverage strategic alliances with
key technology companies.

     iXL derives its revenue from fees for services for the design and delivery
of e-business solutions. These solutions typically include Web-based
applications, many of which integrate with a client's existing computer systems.
These solutions can incorporate multiple capabilities, including business
strategy consulting; creative design; information architecture; software
engineering; project management; and audio, video and animation production. iXL
offers its services on a time and materials and fixed-price basis.

     iXL has incurred substantial losses since its inception. As of June 30,
2001, iXL had an accumulated deficit of approximately $570.2 million. There has
been a significant decline in revenue over the last year of the operations. The
demand for Internet consulting services is changing rapidly. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2000, Internet consultants, including iXL, experienced a
significant reduction in demand. This overall slowdown affected iXL in that many
of the Company's Global 1000 clients rethought or delayed implementing their
Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as to our Global 1000 clients
resulted in part from diminished competitive pressures from dot.com companies,
which were struggling or failing. In addition, many larger traditional companies
have chosen to utilize in-house resources for the implementation of their
Internet initiative in lieu of those offered by iXL and its competitors. As a
result, the average amount of time invested by iXL to attempt to secure any
given project has increased. It is likely that demand for Internet consulting
services, including those offered by iXL, will remain lower than prior levels
for the foreseeable future.

     This reduction in demand has adversely affected iXL's revenue. In response
to these factors, iXL initiated an extensive restructuring plan designed to
reduce iXL's workforce and lower general and administrative expenses. This is
further discussed in Note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements
contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. As a result of the
restructuring and employee terminations, iXL may have difficulty retaining its
most qualified employees. Likewise, iXL may have difficulty attracting new
qualified employees. The failure to attract and retain qualified creative,
technical, consulting and sales personnel could materially and adversely affect
iXL's financial condition and results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Comparison of Three Months Ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000

     Revenue.  Revenue decreased $85.7 million, or 73%, to $32.7 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2001 from $118.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the significant reduction
of demand experienced by Internet consultants, including iXL. This overall
slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients reevaluated or
delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as
to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished competitive
pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing. In addition,
many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses decreased
$29.5 million, or 54%, to $25.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2001
from $55.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services headcount over the
same period last year as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts. As a
percentage of revenue, professional services expenses increased from 47% for the
three months ended June 30, 2000 to 78% for the three months ended June 30,
2001. The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue was due to
the substantial decrease in revenue over the same period as described above.
Also, see the discussion of the industry trend in the "Overview" section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.8
million, or 51%, to $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from
$11.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was
primarily attributable to decreased advertising, promotional material, and
public relations expenditures.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
decreased $28.7 million, or 68%, to $13.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 from $42.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. This
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other Expenses.  Stock-based compensation and
other expense decreased to $405,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2001
from $756,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2000. The $351,000 decrease in
stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in the number of
employees with such stock options as a result of the restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense decreased $222,000, or 5% to $4.7
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $4.9 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL made additional investments in physical
infrastructure and expansion in prior periods in anticipation of continued
growth in 2000. However, this increase in capital assets was offset by the
significant write-offs of property and equipment related to office closures that
iXL has recorded, thus resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense decreased $7.1 million or 63% to $4.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $11.2 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the
write-off of impaired intangible assets that iXL recorded during the three
months ended December 31, 2000 and again during the three months ended June 30,
2001.

     Other Income.  Other income increased $8.0 million to $7.9 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2001 from $(84,000) for the three months ended June
30, 2000. The increase is primarily due to the fact that iXL recorded
approximately $7.0 million in other income related to the adjustment in the
value of certain call rights on warrants associated with iXL's note payable to
ProAct.

     Interest Income.  Interest income decreased $1.3 million or 76% to $350,000
for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $1.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cash and
marketable securities balances at June 30, 2001 versus June 30, 2000.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.1 million or 502% to $1.3
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $219,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to interest expense
and amortization on the note payable to ProAct and an increase in credit
facility fees.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $21.9 million loss as a
result of its equity investment in affiliates during the three months ended June
30, 2000. This loss was related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations. No such charge was recorded for the three months ended June 30,
2001, as all equity investments have a zero basis.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense of benefit in the
three months ended June 30, 2001. This expense was recorded for state income
taxes related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the Tessera
acquisition.

  Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000

     Revenue.  Revenue decreased $146.3 million, or 67%, to $73.4 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $219.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the significant reduction
of demand experienced by Internet consultants, including iXL. This overall
slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients reevaluated or
delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as
to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished competitive
pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing. In addition,
many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses decreased
$42.2 million, or 41%, to $60.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001
from $103.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services headcount over the
same period last year as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts. As a
percentage of revenue, professional services expenses increased from 47% for the
six months ended June 30, 2000 to 83% for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue was due to the
substantial decrease in revenue over the same period as described above. Also,
see the discussion of the industry trend in the "Overview" section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $10.1
million, or 48%, to $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$21.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was
primarily attributable to decreased advertising, promotional material, and
public relations expenditures.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
decreased $46.0 million, or 58%, to $33.5 million for the six months ended June
30, 2001 from $79.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other Expenses.  Stock-based compensation and
other expense decreased to $606,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$3.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The $3.3 million decrease
in stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in the number of
employees with such stock options as a result of the restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $606,000, or 7% to $9.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $9.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily related to additional
investments in physical infrastructure and expansion in prior periods in
anticipation of continued growth, which was partially offset by the significant
write-offs of property and equipment related to office closures that iXL has
recorded.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense decreased $13.6 million or 62% to $8.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $22.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a

result of the write-off of impaired intangible assets that iXL recorded during
the three months ended December 31, 2000 and again during the three months ended
June 30, 2000.

     Other Income.  Other income increased $8.0 million to $7.8 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 from $(266,000) for the six months ended June 30,
2000. The increase is primarily due to the fact that iXL recorded approximately
$7.0 million in other income related to the adjustment in the value of certain
call rights on warrants associated with iXL's note payable to ProAct.

     Interest Income.  Interest income decreased $2.4 million or 73% to $937,000
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $3.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cash and
marketable securities balances at June 30, 2001 versus June 30, 2000.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.6 million or 232% to $2.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $(690,000) for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to interest expense
and amortization on the note payable to ProAct and an increase in credit
facility fees.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $32.1 million loss as a
result of its equity investment in affiliates during the six months ended June
30, 2000. This loss was related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations. No such charge was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
as all equity investments have a zero basis.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense of benefit in the
six months ended June 30, 2001. This expense was recorded for state income taxes
related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the Tessera
acquisition.

  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999

     In June 2000, iXL's ownership of ProAct was reduced to approximately 49% of
the voting interest and 85% of ProAct's outstanding common stock. Accordingly,
iXL's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 do
not include the consolidated financial statements of ProAct as a consolidated
subsidiary. iXL instead has accounted for its ownership using the equity method
of accounting. As a result, iXL believes it is difficult to compare the
operating results for the year ended December 31, 2000 to the operating results
for the year ended December 31, 1999.

     Revenue.  Revenue increased $141.0 million, or 64.6%, to $359.3 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $218.3 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was attributable to an increase in
the number and size of client engagements. Revenue for the six months ended
December 31, 2000 was $139.6 million as compared to $219.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. Beginning in the third quarter of 2000, Internet
consultants, including iXL, experienced a significant reduction in demand. This
overall slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients
rethought or delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market
dynamics as to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished
competitive pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing.
In addition, many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house
resources for the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those
offered by iXL and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses increased
$103.5 million, or 93.8%, to $213.8 million for the twelve months ended December
31, 2000 from $110.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional services
headcount over the same period last year. As a percentage of professional
services revenue, professional services expenses increased from 50.5% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999 to 59.5% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000. The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue
was due to an increased number of professional services personnel hired in
anticipation of higher demand for Internet consulting services. The demand for
iXL's services did not reach the level iXL anticipated. See the discussion of
the industry trend in the Overview section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $9.7
million, or 19.8%, to $39.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
2000 from $49.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. As
discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, the sales and marketing expenses for
ProAct were included in the consolidated sales and marketing expenses contained
in the financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 but
were excluded from the consolidated sales and marketing expenses contained in
the financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000. An
increase in salaries and other payroll related costs, travel expenses and use of
outside services in 2000 over 1999 was offset by the inclusion of ProAct's sales
and marketing expenses in 1999. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing
expenses decreased to 10.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from
22.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
increased $80.2 million, or 83.9%, to $175.8 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 from $95.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt
expense, an increase in rent and increases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses related to the increase in the number of general and
administrative personnel necessary to support iXL's anticipated growth. As
discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, the general and administrative
expenses for ProAct were included in the consolidated general and administrative
expenses contained in the financial statements for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 but were excluded from the consolidated general and
administrative expenses contained in the financial statements for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses increased to 48.9% for the twelve months ended December
31, 2000 from 43.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other.  Stock-based compensation and other
expense decreased $0.7 million to $4.2 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 from $4.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in
the number of employees with such stock options as a result of the
restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $7.6 million to $20.5 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $12.9 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily related to increases
in leasehold improvements and equipment.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense increased $25.8 million to $44.0
million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $18.2 million for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily a result of
the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce recorded in connection with
the acquisition of Tessera Enterprises Systems, Inc.

     Impairment Charge on Intangible Assets.  iXL recorded a $97.4 million
impairment charge on intangible assets during the twelve months ended December
31, 2000. No such charge was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. The charge is the result of a write-down of certain intangible assets
resulting from a sustained drop in the market capitalization of iXL and the
changes in the dynamics of the demand for Internet consulting services. See Note
5 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus.

     Restructuring Charges.  iXL recorded a $76.6 million restructuring charge
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2000. No such charge was recorded
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. The restructuring charge includes
charges for rent and sublease expenses and severance costs. See Note 4 of the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Other Expenses.  Other expenses increased $1.6 million to $1.8 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $0.2 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily the result of the
write off of property and equipment not affiliated with the restructuring
charge.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased $1.8 million to $5.4 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.6 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to increased
cash and marketable securities balances in 2000 versus 1999.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.1 million to $2.1 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $1.0 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to borrowings
under iXL's credit facility.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $41.1 million loss on
equity investments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 as compared
to a $65,000 loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This loss
was primarily related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations under the equity method of accounting. See Note 3 of the consolidated
financial statements contained elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense or benefit in
the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This expense was recorded for state
income taxes related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the
Tessera acquisition.

  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998

     The following discussion relates to iXL's actual operating results for the
periods noted. These operating results include the operations of the companies
acquired by iXL during the periods referenced from the date of acquisition only.
iXL completed 24 acquisitions during 1998 and one during 1999. As a result, iXL
believes the operating results for the year ended December 31, 1999 are not
comparable to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998.

     Revenue.  Revenue increased $153.5 million, or 236.9%, to $218.3 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $64.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to a
series of acquisitions throughout 1998 and to an aggressive hiring initiative
throughout 1999 and 1998 which expanded iXL's client base and headcount. The
growth was also due to an increase in the number and size of client engagements
and the development and growth of industry practice groups and other Internet
based business solutions.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses increased
$74.5 million, or 208.1%, to $110.3 million for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999 from $35.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. This
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to the
integration of the companies acquired by iXL, organic growth in billable
headcount, as well as to the development of ProAct. As a percentage of revenue,
professional services expenses decreased to 50.5% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999, down from 55.2% for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in billing rates and
improvements in revenue per billable employee.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $33.0
million, or 206.3%, to $49.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999 from $16.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The
increase was primarily attributable to the increase in headcount due to the
development of iXL's sales and marketing infrastructure and staff. As a
percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 22.4% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999, down from 24.7% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 1998.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
increased $53.0 million, or 124.4%, to $95.6 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 from $42.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in headcount due
to the integration of the companies acquired by iXL since January 1, 1998, as
well as the expansion of management and physical infrastructure to support the
growth in iXL's operations. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 43.8% for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999, from 65.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other.  Stock-based compensation and other
expense increased $3.3 million to $4.9 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 from $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to an increase in
the number of employees with such stock options.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $7.7 million, or 146%, to
$12.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $5.2 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The increase primarily related to
the depreciation of assets of the companies acquired by iXL since January 1,
1998 and an increase in property and equipment at these companies after
acquisition.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense increased $7.6 million, or 72%, to
$18.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $10.6 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The increase was a result of the
amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce recorded in connection with the
acquisitions that took place during 1998.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased $2.8 million to $3.6 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $0.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily due to increased
cash and marketable securities balances in 1999 versus 1998.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $0.2 million to $1.0 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $0.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily due to borrowings
under iXL's credit facility.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  Loss on equity investments decreased
to $65,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $1.6 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The decrease was a result of a
reduction in equity investments on which to record losses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     iXL has funded its operations primarily with cash generated from
operations, sales of securities and bank borrowings. On January 7, 2000, iXL
entered into a senior secured revolving syndicated credit facility with several
institutions providing for borrowings of up to $50.0 million. The credit
facility expires on January 7, 2002. The credit facility bears interest payable
at least quarterly at a rate of either (i) 2.75% plus an adjusted LIBOR rate or
(ii) 1.75% plus the greater of Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate or .5% plus the
federal funds rate. The credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all
of the assets of iXL's domestic operating subsidiaries. These obligations are
also secured by all of the capital stock of iXL's domestic operating
subsidiaries, iXL's stock holdings in ProAct, the general and limited
partnership interests in iXL Ventures LP, and 65% of the capital stock of iXL's
foreign subsidiaries, including the pledge of the capital stock of the same
subsidiary companies. The credit facility provides for borrowings based upon a
borrowing base formula of qualified billed and unbilled accounts receivable. A
commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the credit facility.

     On December 7, 2000, iXL executed an amendment to the credit facility to
waive a violation of a financial covenant. The credit facility was further
amended to do the following: restrict the borrowing base to qualified billed
accounts receivable from domestic operations; permit the sale by iXL of equity
interests forming part of the collateral securing iXL's obligations associated
with the credit facility; reduce the amount of permitted capital expenditures;
reduce the minimum required consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and require iXL to maintain an
minimum level of liquidity.

     On March 30, 2001, iXL executed an amendment to its senior secured
revolving syndicated credit facility which reduced the commitment under the
credit facility in stages from $50,000,000 to $20,000,000 pursuant to certain
events, expanded the borrowing base to include foreign receivables and certain
assets of iXL Ventures and eliminated and amended certain financial covenants.
The amended credit facility established certain EBITDA (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenants for the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2001. This amendment to the credit facility became
effective on April 2, 2001. At June 30, 2001, iXL was in violation of a
financial covenant under the credit facility. Effective August

10, 2001, the lenders waived any event of default resulting from this covenant
violation until the earlier of the completion of the pending merger or November
30, 2001 and the commitment under the credit facility was reduced to $8,050,000.

     At June 30, 2001, iXL had $3,700,000 in borrowings outstanding under the
credit facility and had utilized approximately $8,048,000 of the credit facility
for letters of credit issued primarily as security for office leases. iXL repaid
the borrowings outstanding in July 2001.

     On March 30, 2001, pursuant to an agreement in principle reached March 26,
2001, iXL sold 15,875,000 shares of restricted common stock to unaffiliated
third parties and to parties related to iXL through its principal stockholder,
including two directors, for total proceeds of approximately $15,875,000 before
expenses. This stock sale was subject to certain conditions, including the
effectiveness of the amendment to the credit facility as discussed above.

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL had $23.2 million of working capital, including
$25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $202,000 of marketable
securities, as compared to $38.5 million of working capital, including $45.3
million in cash and cash equivalents and $239,000 in marketable securities as of
March 31, 2001 and $40.5 million of working capital, including $48.6 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $4.0 million in marketable securities as of
December 31, 2000.

     Cash used in operating activities was $42.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2001, as compared to cash used in operating activities of $10.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Cash used in operating
activities for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was largely due to a decrease
in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and the restructuring reserve.
iXL calculates average days' sales outstanding (DSO) based on billed and
unbilled receivables less deferred revenue. The DSO for the quarter ended June
30, 2001 was 65 as compared to 77 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Cash
used in investing activities was $651,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2001, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $78.4 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2000. Cash used by investing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 was due to purchases of property and equipment. This
was partially offset by the sale of certain assets that were non-strategic to
the scope of our principal business. Cash provided by financing activities was
$21.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 as compared to cash
provided by financing activities of $24.5 million for the six months ended June
30, 2000. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June
30, 2001 primarily resulted from the sale of restricted common stock.

     iXL has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception. iXL's future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many
factors. iXL's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased to
$52.6 million at December 31, 2000 from $155.7 million at December 31, 1999, of
which $15.2 million related to ProAct. iXL's cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities decreased to $25.8 million at June 30, 2001. At the time
of filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, iXL believed that its existing cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with funds available
under the credit facility, and proceeds from recent stock sales in March 2001
would be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for working capital and
capital expenditures for the remainder of 2001.

     Subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K, iXL has experienced additional
declines in revenue resulting in continued operating losses and iXL violated an
amended debt covenant as of June 30, 2001. On July 31, 2001, iXL and Scient
entered into a definitive agreement to merge. Stockholders of approximately 34%
of the outstanding common stock of iXL and stockholders of approximately 34% of
the outstanding common stock of Scient have agreed to vote their shares in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement. However, there can be no assurance that
the merger will be successfully completed as it is subject to stockholder
approval by the stockholders of each of iXL and Scient respectively.

     iXL believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities and cash from operations, together with funds that may be available
under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for
working capital and capital expenditures until the earlier of the consummation
of the pending merger or November 30, 2001. In the event the merger does not
close by November 30, 2001, iXL would be in violation of certain debt covenants
or be required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit

under the credit facility with cash and, among other things, would not have
access to funds under the credit facility. As a result, iXL would require
additional funds or liquidity to fund its operations or further reduce its
workforce, or both. iXL is also continuing its efforts to raise additional funds
through the sale of certain minority equity interests in developing businesses
held by iXL Ventures. There can be no assurance any such assets can be sold on
acceptable terms or for cash. If iXL raises additional funds through the
issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities, such equity securities
may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of common stock.
Furthermore, because of the low trading price of iXL's common stock, the number
of shares of the new equity or equity-related securities that may be required to
be issued may cause stockholders to experience significant additional dilution.
In addition, the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or
perceived risk of iXL. iXL cannot, however, be certain that additional
financing, or funds from asset sales, will be available on acceptable terms if
required. If this additional financing becomes necessary and is not available or
we are unable to raise funds from the sale of assets or the pending merger with
Scient does not close in the time period anticipated, iXL may need to
dramatically change its business plan or face bankruptcy or liquidation. The
matters discussed above raise substantial doubt about iXL's ability to continue
as a going concern if the merger is not completed. The audited financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

         IXL QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     On December 19, 2000 iXL consummated a transaction with ProAct in which iXL
Ventures PHC, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of iXL, issued a 5.75%
secured convertible note to ProAct in exchange for a cash payment of $20.0
million. The note is secured by and exchangeable for, upon satisfaction of
certain conditions, ten million shares of common stock of ProAct held by iXL
Ventures PHC, Inc. iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. has no other properties or assets
other than its interest in the ProAct common stock. The note is non-recourse to
iXL Enterprises, Inc.

     The note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis
commencing March 31, 2001. The entire amount of unpaid principal and accrued and
unpaid interest is due and payable on January 7, 2004. iXL may at any time
prepay all or a portion of the principal amount. iXL may repay the principal
amount of the note by payment in cash or under certain circumstances by transfer
of the pledged collateral. Also, ProAct, at its option, may at any time (1)
exchange the note for the pledged collateral or (2) purchase the pledged
collateral for $20.0 million. iXL is required to make adjustments to the
carrying value of the note for changes in the fair value of ProAct's common
stock because the terms of the note enable ProAct to exchange the note for the
pledged collateral. iXL will record any resulting adjustment as interest income
or interest expense.

     Additionally, in conjunction with the issuance of the secured convertible
note, iXL issued to ProAct call rights to purchase up to ten million shares of
its common stock owned by iXL Ventures, LP, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of iXL, at a purchase price of $3.00 per share. ProAct may exercise the call
rights at any time for all or a portion of the call shares provided that the
minimum amount of call shares purchased at any time is 500,000. The call rights
expire on January 7, 2004.

     iXL is required to make adjustments to the carrying value of the note for
changes in the fair value of ProAct's common stock because the terms of the note
enable ProAct to exchange the note for the pledged collateral. iXL will record
any resulting adjustment as interest income or interest expense. iXL is also
required to carry the call rights at their fair value during their term with any
resulting changes in the fair value being recorded as other income or expense.
iXL uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of
the call rights. During the three months ended June 30, 2001, iXL adjusted the
value of the call rights by approximately $7.0 million and recorded this amount
as other income.

    accurately illustrates the potential value of a stock option.

REPORT OF THE IXL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     The following Report on Executive Compensation and the performance graph
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus do not constitute
soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference
into any other iXL filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent iXL specifically incorporates this
Report or the performance graph by reference therein.

     The Compensation Committee of iXL's Board of Directors is responsible for
the following matters with respect to the compensation of iXL's Chief Executive
Officer and other executive officers as well as those of iXL's subsidiaries:

     - reviews, recommends and approves the base salaries of iXL's and its
       subsidiaries' executive officers;

     - reviews, recommends and approves iXL's annual incentive compensation
       programs;

     - administers iXL's equity-based compensation programs, including approval
       of stock option grants;

     - reviews, recommends and approves changes to iXL's benefits programs;

     - reviews and recommends all employment related agreements and amendments
       thereof; and

     - reviews, approves and authorizes the process and design elements of all
       other aspects of compensation.

     The Compensation Committee through its designees continually monitors
market practices and trends, and makes revisions as necessary to ensure that
iXL's programs are adequate to attract and retain the best possible executive
talent. The Compensation Committee is comprised of three non-employee directors,
namely Messrs. Wall, Bynum, and Walker.

What is iXL's philosophy regarding executive officer compensation?

     iXL's executive compensation programs for 2000, which consisted of a
combination of base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity-based
awards, serve the following principal purposes:

     - to attract and retain the best possible executive talent;

     - to provide additional incentive to these executives to achieve the goals
       inherent in iXL's business strategy;

     - to link executive and shareholder interests through equity-based plans;
       and

     - to provide a compensation package that recognizes individual
       contributions as well as overall business results.

     The Committee believes that this performance and results-based compensation
philosophy will attract and retain the type of executive talent necessary to
achieve iXL's business objectives. iXL's compensation plans have been developed
and communicated in a manner designed to encourage a culture where executives
understand expectations, choose to remain with iXL and seek to improve results.

What are the components of executive compensation?

     In determining compensation levels for 2000, the Compensation Committee
primarily relied upon publicly available compensation information and informal
survey information obtained by management with respect to cash compensation and
stock option grants to similarly situated officers of comparable companies.
Additionally, the Compensation Committee based its review of stock option grants
on various factors, including without limitation the executive's
responsibilities, the executive's past, present and expected future
contributions to iXL and the executive's current stock and option holdings.

     Annual Salary.  The Compensation Committee reviews each executive officer's
salary annually. In determining the appropriate salary levels, the Compensation
Committee considers, among other factors, the executive's scope of
responsibility, prior experience, past accomplishments and data on prevailing
compensa-

tion levels in relevant markets for executive talent. There is no set annual
salary grading structure for iXL's senior executive team, as each salary is
based on an analysis of executive and position-specific information. None of
these factors is weighted or subject to a formula.

     The Compensation Committee believes that the base salary levels of the
executive officers are competitive considering the factors above, and its focus
on at-risk compensation that emphasizes incentive pay.

     Annual Incentive Compensation.  Annual incentives for iXL's executive
officers, excluding its Chief Executive Officer, were determined based on iXL's
and the executive's, as the case may be, achievement of specified goals. The key
measurement areas included, among other factors, client satisfaction, market
awareness, financial performance, organizational goals and personal goals. The
weighting of the key measurements varied for each executive, depending on his or
her role with iXL. Also depending on a participant's role in iXL, the
achievement of certain goals was measured on a company-wide or individual office
basis.

     The Compensation Committee reviewed iXL's and each executive officer's
performance, as well as recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer, in
determining the annual incentive payments to executive officers.

     Long-Term Incentive Compensation.  iXL maintains certain equity-based
compensation plans that allow the Compensation Committee to award the
individuals it selects with stock options. These plans are as follows: (a) the
iXL Enterprises, Inc. 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan, and (b) the iXL
Enterprises, Inc. 1999B Employee Stock Option Plan. Awards under iXL's
stock-based compensation plans directly link potential participant rewards to
increases in shareholder value.

     iXL historically has provided all equity-based compensation in the form of
stock options. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or
greater than the market price of iXL's common stock on the date of the grant and
each generally vest over a four year period in four equal installments of 25% on
each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.
This approach is designed to encourage the creation of shareholder value and the
retention of the executives over the long term, as this element of the
compensation package has value only to the extent that stock price appreciation
occurs.

     In determining stock option awards to iXL's executive officers in 2000, the
Compensation Committee also considered each executive's responsibilities, the
executive's past, present and expected future contributions to iXL and the
executive's current stock and option holdings.

     iXL Leaders Fund, L.P.  During 1999, iXL organized the iXL Leaders Fund,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Fund"). The purpose of the Fund is to
enable iXL to recruit and retain officers and other key employees of outstanding
ability and to motivate these employees to exert their best efforts on iXL's
behalf. The Fund enabled certain qualified iXL employees to participate in
investment opportunities identified by iXL Leaders Fund GP I, L.L.C., the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner") in a variety of private
equity investments.

     Certain iXL employees, who were "accredited investors" (as defined under
the federal securities laws) and who were approved for participation by the
General Partner, were eligible to invest in the Fund as limited partners on a
one-time basis in April 2000. Each participating employee was required to make a
capital commitment of at least $25,000, but no more than $250,000, to the Fund.
iXL matched each participating employee's capital contribution on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, which in the aggregate totaled approximately $2.43
million. No further contributions will be made to the Fund.

     Each participating employee shall be fully vested with respect to returns
on his or her capital contributions and related profits (except upon a default
by such employee), but will vest in certain distributions of other profits
related to iXL's matching contributions with respect to such participating
employee at the rate of 25% per year on December 31 of 2000 through 2003.
Participating employees are not entitled to receive distributions other than
distributions necessary to satisfy his or her tax liabilities in respect of such
investments until iXL has recouped its matching contributions and expenses plus
a 12% return.

How is iXL's chief executive officer compensated?

     The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the compensation
of iXL's Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee believes that in
the highly competitive, emerging markets in which iXL operates, equity-based
compensation provides the greatest incentive for outstanding executive
performance and the greatest alignment of management and shareholder long-term
interests. Mr. Ellis served as Chief Executive Officer during 2000. He did not
receive a cash bonus during 2000, but was granted stock options totaling
510,577. See "-- iXL Stock Option Information -- Option Grants in Last Fiscal
Year" and the footnotes thereto for details concerning grants to Mr. Ellis. In
February 2001, Mr. Formant joined iXL as President and Chief Executive Officer.

How is iXL addressing Internal Revenue Code limits on deductibility of
compensation?

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally
disallows a federal income tax deduction to public companies for certain
compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a corporation's chief executive
officer or any of its four other most highly compensated executive officers.
Qualifying performance-based compensation will not be subject to the deduction
limit if certain requirements are met. iXL has structured its equity-based
compensation plans (i.e., obtained shareholder approval of plans) to qualify the
compensation income deemed to be received upon the exercise of stock options
granted under the plans as performance-based compensation. The Compensation
Committee intends to review the potential effects of Section 162(m) periodically
and in the future may decide to structure additional portions of iXL's
compensation programs in a manner designed to permit unlimited deductibility for
federal income tax purposes. iXL is not currently subject to the limitations of
Section 162(m) because none of its executive officers received cash payments
from iXL during 2000 in excess of $1 million. To the extent that iXL is subject
to the Code 162(m) limitation in the future, the effect of this limitation may
be mitigated by net operating losses, although the amount of any deduction
disallowed under Section 162(m) could increase the alternative minimum tax by up
to 2% of such disallowed amount. For information relating to iXL's net operating
losses, see Note 17 to iXL's Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

IXL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS

     No member of iXL's Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or
employee of iXL or serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation
committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a

IXL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     iXL entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Formant beginning
February 1, 2001 continuing until December 31, 2003. Mr. Formant's initial base
salary is $500,000, subject to adjustments annually at the Compensation
Committee's discretion. In addition to Mr. Formant's base salary, he is eligible
to receive a bonus, based upon a formula, in an amount not less than $250,000,
paid in quarterly installments throughout the calendar year. Mr. Formant also
received a option to purchase 1 million shares of iXL's common stock and
purchased 1.5 million shares of common stock (see "iXL Transactions with Related
Parties"). In the event Mr. Formant's employment is terminated for reasons other
than cause, he will be entitled to received twelve months of his then current
base salary together with continued benefits. He will also be entitled to
receive any accrued, but unpaid, bonus amount. The severance payable can be
reduced in the event Mr. Formant finds other suitable employment during the
severance period. In addition, if Mr. Formant is terminated for reasons

other than cause, the greater of (i) one-half of any unvested options or (ii)
vested options resulting from a one-year forward vesting, will immediately vest.
In the event of a change of control, Mr. Formant shall be eligible to receive
any rights, benefits and entitlements made generally available to other members
of executive management. The employment agreement will continue in full force
and effect. Concurrent with any change of control, the greater of (i) one-half
of any unvested options or (ii) vested options resulting from a one-year forward
vesting, will immediately vest. If Mr. Formant is terminated without cause
within one year of a change of control or his duties and responsibilities are
materially diminished, he is entitled to a lump sum payment in an amount equal
to not less than two times his then current base salary plus any accrued, but
unpaid, bonus amount; in addition, the remaining unpaid balance of the four-year
stock purchase loan described in "iXL Transactions with Related Parties" shall
be forgiven and all outstanding stock options be accelerated and fully vested.
Mr. Formant agrees to keep iXL's secrets and confidential information and will
not disclose any such information obtained during his employment. For a period
of twelve months following the end of his employment, or three months if he is
terminated without cause or for good reason, Mr. Formant cannot become
associated with competitive companies listed in the agreement, nor will he
solicit any of iXL's employees and customers or representatives of those
customers. In the event that iXL becomes bankrupt or insolvent within one year
after the date of Mr. Formant's employment agreement, any unpaid amounts due
under the four-year stock purchase loan shall be forgiven.

     In connection with the merger, Mr. Formant and iXL have executed an
Agreement of Amendment and Assignment with respect to his employment agreement.
In the Agreement of Amendment and Assignment, among other things:

     - Mr. Formant consents to the assignment of his employment contract to
       Holdco;

     - Mr. Formant's bonus entitlement is amended to provide for any such bonus
       as determined by the Holdco board of directors;

     - Mr. Formant's severance benefit is amended to eliminate entitlement to
       accrued but unpaid bonuses;

     - Mr. Formant agrees that the transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement will not be deemed to constitute a change of control or good
       reason for resignation;

     - the noncompetition and nonsolicitation of customers provisions applicable
       to Mr. Formant are deleted; and

     - Mr. Formant consents to the treatment of his options in the manner
       applicable to all options as specified in the merger agreement.

This Agreement of Amendment and Assignment will become effective upon completion
of the merger.

                             IXL PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following graph compares, for the period from June 3, 1999 (the date
that iXL's common stock was first publicly traded) to December 31, 2000, the
cumulative total stockholder return on the common stock of iXL with:

     - the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S.) Index; and

     - the J.P. Morgan H&Q Internet Index (formerly known as the Chase H&Q
       Internet Index)

     The graph assumes that $100 was invested on June 3, 1999 in iXL's common
stock and on May 31, 1999 in the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S.) Index and the J.P.
Morgan H&Q Internet Index, and further assumes no payment or reinvestment of
dividends. The stock price performance on the following graph is historical and
not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Christopher M. Formant.................   January 9, 2001           1,500,000           $1,500,000
Frank K. Bynum, Jr.....................    March 30, 2001             275,000              275,000

     In contemplation of his employment, Mr. Formant purchased 1.5 million
shares of iXL common stock in a private placement. The purchase price of $1.00
was the closing market price on the date of purchase. The purchase price of the
shares was paid by two loans from iXL: a four-year promissory note in the amount
of $1 million and a bridge note in the amount of $500,000, each bearing interest
at 9% per annum, payable at maturity. The bridge note was due and payable
promptly upon Mr. Formant's receipt of payment of his capital account (or other
funds such as his 401K) from his previous employer. Mr. Formant repaid the
bridge note in March 2001. The four-year promissory note is due and payable on
January 9, 2005. Mr. Formant has agreed to prepay the loan with the net after
tax proceeds of any annual bonus he receives in excess of $500,000, plus the net
after tax proceeds from the sale of any shares acquired from the stock purchased
or from the sale of exercised stock options. The shares purchased are subject to
the terms and conditions of a Pledge and Security Agreement.

     On March 30, 2001, iXL completed a private placement of common stock to
various investors. iXL director Mr. Bynum participated in this private
placement.

SHAREHOLDER BOARD DESIGNEES

     Under a shareholders agreement, iXL is required to include as board
nominees at every annual stockholders' meeting (or at any special stockholders'
meeting for the election directors) two individuals designated by the Kelso
Funds and one individual designated by J.P. Morgan Partners (23A SBIC), LLC
(formerly CB Investors, L.P.) so long as each of these stockholders own at least
5% of iXL outstanding common stock.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     On March 22, 2000, iXL's former subsidiary ProAct Technologies Corp.
(formerly known as Consumer Financial Network, Inc.) ("ProAct") issued and sold
an aggregate of 32,896,000 shares of its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock
for a purchase price of $4.00 per share. Purchasers of these shares included the
Kelso Funds (of which iXL director Mr. Bynum is a Managing Director) (an
aggregate of 1,250,000 shares), U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. (62,500 shares) and Urchie
B. Ellis, the father of U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. (5,000 shares). In connection with
this equity financing a Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement and a
Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement were executed. The
business purpose of this transaction was to raise working capital. This issuance
was valued based on a negotiated estimate of the fair market value of ProAct.
iXL believes this issuance was negotiated at arms' length and was made on terms
no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     Mr. Ellis is a limited partner in the partnership that owns the building in
which iXL began leasing space in May 1997. The lease expires December 31, 2008.
In 2000, iXL paid approximately $1.1 million in rental payments. iXL believes
this lease is at fair market value and was negotiated on an arm's-length basis.
iXL's effective lease rate is $15.50 per square foot, compared to a range of
$12.50 to $16.50 per square foot for comparable space.

     In March 2000, iXL contributed assets to AppGeneSys, Inc. in exchange for
10 million shares of AppGeneSys' Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 10
million shares of AppGeneSys' Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (constituting
in the aggregate approximately 27% of the voting power of AppGeneSys).
Contemporaneously with such asset contribution, AppGeneSys issued and sold an
aggregate of 50 million shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for a
purchase price of $1.00 per share. Purchasers of these shares included Kelso
Funds (of which iXL director Mr. Bynum is a Managing Director) (an aggregate of
7,300,000 shares, constituting approximately 10% of the voting power), NeoCarta
Ventures, L.P. and NeoCarta Scout Fund, LLC (in which the iXL Leaders Fund,
L.P., Mr. Ellis, and certain of the Kelso investment professionals, including
iXL director Mr. Bynum, hold an interest) (an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares,
constituting approximately 4% of the voting power), the iXL Leaders Fund, L.P.
(500 shares, constituting less than 1% of the voting power), and U. Bertram
Ellis, Jr. (225,000 shares, constituting less than 1% of the voting power). Mr.
Ellis serves as a director of AppGeneSys. In connection with this equity
financing a Stockholders Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement were
executed. The business purpose of this transaction was to raise working capital
for AppGeneSys. This issuance was valued based on a negotiated estimate of the
fair market value of AppGeneSys. The asset contribution was approved by the
Spin-Off Committee of the Board of Directors. iXL believes this issuance was
negotiated at arms' length and was made on terms no less favorable to iXL than
could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Contemporaneously with
these transactions, iXL executed (a) a Master Services Agreement with AppGeneSys
regarding the delivery of services in the ordinary course of business to
AppGeneSys, and (b) a Strategic Alliance Agreement pursuant to which AppGeneSys
will participate in the iXL Ventures Program and iXL became AppGeneSys'
preferred provider of core services, and likewise AppGeneSys has become iXL's
preferred provider of AppGeneSys' core services.

     iXL believes that all of the transactions set forth above were negotiated
at arm's length and were made on terms no less favorable to us than could have
been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

                                SCIENT BUSINESS

     Scient is a leading provider of a category of professional services called
systems innovation. Scient provides integrated eBusiness strategy and technology
implementation services on a global basis to enterprise clients who want to
fully leverage eBusiness technologies as part of their overall business
strategy. Scient's service offering includes strategy consulting, systems
architecture and design, application and technology infrastructure development,
and eBusiness management. Scient's services are designed to improve a client's
competitive position and increase efficiency through the development of
innovative business strategies enabled by the integration of emerging and
existing technologies.

SERVICES

     Scient uses eBusiness as a catalyst to help its clients unlock the value
hidden in their enterprises. Scient's process leverages Scient's expertise in
strategy, customer experience and technology to help clients create new sources
of revenue and eliminate cost. Scient also works with clients to increase their
organization's abilities to anticipate and capitalize on changes in their
business environment. Scient's service offering includes strategy consulting,
architecture and design services, application and technology infrastructure
development, and eBusiness management. The following descriptions highlight the
primary services that Scient offers.

     Strategy Consulting.  Scient works with clients to tailor a business
strategy designed to provide them with measurable results. Scient's goal is to
leverage the industry and eBusiness experience and knowledge base of Scient's
professionals along with the experiences of Scient's clients' senior executives
to formulate innovative, executable and flexible eBusiness strategies.

     Architecture and Design.  In addition to strategy, Scient offers
architecture and design capabilities to its clients. Using a variety of
technologies, Scient architects eBusiness applications and technology
infrastructure for clients. Recognizing that the technical infrastructure
becomes the foundation for any future application development, Scient's
technology infrastructure design services focus on enabling eBusiness
applications to be reliable, robust, secure, scalable and extensible.
Additionally, Scient offers customer experience design to its clients. Because
Scient considers the user interface to be more than just visual design, Scient
incorporates its abilities in information architecture, user interface
engineering, editorial services, and usability research to develop systems with
innovative customer experience.

     Application and Technology Infrastructure Development.  Scient builds and
implements innovative eBusiness applications and technology infrastructure that
take into account the current and future business needs of Scient's clients.
This can be accomplished through Scient's Engineer Acceleration Center (EAC),
with teams located either on the client's site or in Scient's dedicated
facilities in Dallas, Texas. Scient's EAC was established to provide deeply
skilled teams, an integrated customer experience and technology process, along
with dedicated technology to provide the most efficient, effective and highest
quality solutions to Scient's clients. The EAC offers a pre-configured
development environment to Scient's clients that is intended to establish
processes, project management structures, and standards that reduce overall
project risks. All of this results in a reduced cost of development and a
potential accelerated return on investment for Scient's clients. Scient
recognizes that new types of communications devices are proliferating, network
usage is expanding, and the future of eBusiness will be dependent upon the
development and integration of a variety of technologies. Scient builds
applications and technology infrastructure intended to accommodate these changes
in the eBusiness environment. Scient's applications and technology
infrastructure development services utilize Scient's capabilities in application
software, networks, systems, security and infrastructure architecture. Scient
develops applications and technology infrastructure to be robust and to serve as
the foundation for eBusiness innovations that can link to existing systems and
technologies.

     eBusiness Management.  Upon completion of engagements, Scient offers its
clients eBusiness management to help them operate and extend their eBusinesses.
These services include remote systems management, application management,
performance management, content management, and system security management and
are provided on a monthly subscription basis with established service level
agreements. Scient's extended capabilities leverage the iterative nature of the
Scient Approach methodology to provide the framework and business structure for
continuous re-innovation of an eBusiness.

THE SCIENT APPROACH(TM) METHODOLOGY

     The Scient Approach methodology is a well-defined process that helps Scient
efficiently and successfully deliver Scient's services. This methodology
provides a framework that facilitates the distribution of knowledge within an
engagement and across all parts of Scient's firm. The Scient Approach
methodology is designed to allow Scient to provide consistent quality across
engagements and to deliver high value to clients in all aspects of Scient's
services.

     The key to the Scient Approach methodology is the iterative improvement of
the eBusiness innovations that Scient delivers. Because the needs of Scient's
clients are dynamic, Scient has designed the Scient Approach methodology with
built-in feedback and iteration processes in order to improve the services
delivered to clients and to enhance the approach itself. These processes serve
as a critical feedback tool that assists Scient in designing and extending
eBusinesses for its clients.

     The Scient Approach methodology has four general stages: Conceive,
Architect, Engineer and Operate. Each of these stages includes the critical
decisions Scient's clients must make in order to build an eBusiness. The
methodology also includes two foundational elements: Launch and Innovate, which
are interwoven throughout the approach.

     Conceive.  During the Conceive stage of the approach, Scient works closely
with the client to define the overall business strategy for the eBusiness,
including market positioning and value offering. The five components of the
Conceive stage include Assessing, Visioning, Conceptualizing, Prototyping, and
Defining. Upon completion of the Conceive stage, Scient should have the
information necessary to define key business success factors and to prioritize
the client's eBusiness initiatives based on a common understanding of the
client's eBusiness objectives.

     Architect.  In the Architect stage, Scient defines the scope of the
eBusiness to be developed and designs applications to enable clients to meet
their objectives. Scient also scopes and designs the underlying infrastructure
to integrate the software, network and hardware components necessary to support
the applications. This stage includes the evaluation of any third party
software. The architect stage occurs in two phases, Architect-Scope and
Architect-Design.

     - Architect-Scope.  The goal of this phase is to collect application and
       process requirements to develop a baseline for the Architect-Design
       phase.

     - Architect-Design.  During this phase, Scient defines the processes,
       components and timeline necessary to realize the application goals. The
       goal of this phase is to create a complete plan that allows the
       applications to be constructed, tested and implemented on time and within
       budget.

     After the Architect stage, the client has a "blueprint" for its eBusiness
development. This blueprint identifies in detail the tasks necessary to meet the
objectives and overall strategy goals as defined in the Conceive stage.

     Engineer.  In this stage, Scient iteratively builds and delivers the
eBusiness, which may include the incorporation or integration of third party
software or devices. Within this stage are three phases that are focused on
successfully implementing the applications defined during the Architect stage.
Scient has established the Engineer Acceleration Center (EAC) in Dallas, Texas
to provide world class software engineering. The EAC provides deeply skilled
teams, integrated customer experience and technology processes, and dedicated
technology to achieve the most efficient, effective, and highest quality
solutions for Scient's clients.

     - Transition to the EAC.  In this phase, the Scient project team and EAC
       transition team work to transition the project into the EAC by
       understanding the major project components, identify gaps and risks,
       develop solutions and risk mitigation plans, and establish project
       responsibilities to ensure the successful delivery of the project.

     - Engineer-Detailed Design.  In this phase, Scient works with the client to
       finalize specific details of the requirements, including all customer
       interaction interfaces and detailed technical designs.

     - Engineer-Construct.  In this phase, the modules of the application are
       built, refined and unit tested. This phase is aimed at producing the
       tangible results for the client that were identified in the earlier
       stages of the Scient Approach methodology. Development and QA
       environments are constructed, software development is completed, code
       reviews are performed, and unit testing takes place.

     - Engineer-Test.  In this phase, applications are tested to ensure they
       meet functional, technical and user requirements. This phase intends to
       ensure that the engineered applications perform in accordance with the
       requirements defined in the Architect stage. The EAC offers a full suite
       of functional, integration, and system testing to ensure the overall
       quality and robustness of the delivered system.

     - Engineer-Deploy.  In this phase, the system is deployed into a production
       environment, providing the necessary support and rapid issue resolution.

     The Engineer-Deploy phase will deliver the eBusiness system in its
production environment typically employing performance, security, user
acceptance, and limited volume beta test, followed by a full-scale introduction
to the complete target user population.

     Upon completion of the Engineer stage, Scient delivers the system to the
client. During the transition to operate phase, the Scient team completes all
final deliverables, produces the final distribution media, and conducts formal
transition meetings with the appropriate client operations team.

     Operate.  In the Operate stage, Scient transfers knowledge and techniques
for the eBusiness technical operations and provides a framework for ongoing
re-innovation of the client's eBusiness. By leveraging Scient's knowledge about
the ongoing management and innovation of its eBusiness systems, the client can
effectively perform these services in-house or via an outside service provider.
The Operate stage centers around two separate but related sets of activities.

     - eSolution Management.  This area focuses on transferring knowledge and
       techniques for the day-to-day operations of the eBusiness, allowing
       Scient's client to manage and measure the technical operations of the
       eSolution in-house or through a third-party provider. The eSolution
       Management has two steps:

      - Implement.  In this step, the client's operational requirements and
        architecture are assessed. Scient assists the client to implement a high
        availability management solution within the client's infrastructure or
        through a third-party provider.

      - Manage.  In this step, Scient will assist with the client's ongoing
        eBusiness systems management including application management,
        performance management, content management and system security
        management.

     - eBusiness Management.  This area focuses on the strategic planning of an
       eBusiness solution and extending it into new versions with improved
       capabilities. This involves continued re-innovation and improvement in
       the eBusiness solution, implemented via a series of new releases with
       enhanced capabilities.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Through Scient's global direct sales force and marketing organization,
Scient markets and sells Scient's services to clients who are creating
eBusinesses or are rethinking or expanding their existing businesses to
integrate eBusiness capabilities. Scient's sales professionals are aligned
within global business units. Scient currently targets three principal markets:

     - Financial Services Markets, including financial products and services
       providers such as investment and commercial banks, securities firms,
       insurance companies, credit card companies, and online brokerages and
       lending institutions;

     - Enterprise Markets, which includes Global 1000 companies facing the
       challenges of adapting their businesses' traditional procurement and
       distribution networks to take advantage of eBusiness capabili-

       ties including industrial products, consumer packaged goods,
       manufacturing, energy, transportation and logistics, media and
       entertainment, telecommunications and utilities; and

     - Health and Wellness Markets, which includes pharmaceuticals,
       biotechnology, genomes, medical products and technology and consumer
       wellness, and diagnostics.

     Scient employs a team selling approach, whereby Scient's sales people
collaborate with Scient's business unit professionals and management to identify
prospects, conduct sales and manage client relationships. Due to the strategic
nature of Scient's engagements, Scient typically negotiates with the senior
business and technical management personnel of Scient's current and potential
clients.

     Scient's marketing efforts are focused on creating awareness of the systems
innovation category, establishing Scient as the leader in this category and
building the Scient brand on a global basis. Scient uses a broad mix of programs
to accomplish these goals, including market research, brochures, information
pieces published for industry forums, public relations activities, marketing
programs, seminars and speaking engagements and website marketing.

CLIENTS

     Scient has performed professional services for a variety of clients in many
industries around the world. Scient is currently focused on serving companies in
the Financial Services, Enterprise, and Health and Wellness markets. From
inception through March 31, 2001, Scient has served over 165 clients and has
helped its clients launch approximately 50 eBusinesses. For the three months
ended June 30, 2001, Scient's five largest clients accounted for approximately
49% of Scient's revenues.

     Scient generally enters into contracts with its clients on a time and
materials basis, though Scient sometimes works on a fixed-fee basis or caps the
amounts Scient may invoice. In the future, Scient anticipates an increasing
percentage of its client engagements will be under arrangements with fixed-fee
components. If Scient miscalculates the resources or time needed to complete
engagements with capped or fixed fees, Scient's operating results could be
seriously harmed. Because of the strategic and competitively sensitive nature of
the engagements Scient performs for some of its clients, Scient sometimes agrees
not to perform services for Scient's clients' competitors or in a particular
field for limited periods of time. These non-compete agreements reduce the
number of Scient's prospective clients and reinforce the importance of Scient's
client selection.

DELIVERY SERVICES

     Scient's professional services colleagues are organized into areas of
expertise and core competencies called Delivery Services Groups. These Delivery
Services Groups are designed to address the full range of expertise and
competencies needed in order to address the eBusiness needs of clients in
Scient's targeted markets. When Scient delivers services to its clients, Scient
typically builds an integrated team of professionals from several or all of
Scient's Delivery Services Groups. In addition, the Delivery Services Groups
promote the development of specialized knowledge, techniques and experience, and
foster the training, mentoring and professional development of its members. Each
of Scient's professional service colleagues is in one of the following Delivery
Services Groups:

     - Strategic Services -- Provides consulting services to define and
       implement the strategic business, organization, market and brand
       direction for an eBusiness. Includes strategy consultants and industry
       experienced managers, each of whom is focused on one of Scient's targeted
       markets. Includes service offerings in CRM, Knowledge Management and
       Content Management, eIntegration, Collaborative Commerce and the Scient
       Studio.

     - Architecture and Design services -- Integrates the disciplines of
       technical, experience and business architecture, and all elements of
       design.

     - Build Services -- Delivers the skills and expertise necessary to manage
       and engineer the applications and infrastructure of eBusinesses.

     - Asset Services -- Defines and manages the eBusiness assets Scient
       delivers to clients on a subscription, annuity or service bureau basis.
       The Asset Services works with other Delivery Services Groups, global
       business units, operations, finance and management to package and
       subsequently manage those aspects of Scient's assets that can be offered
       on subscription, annuity or service bureau basis.

     - Project Management Services -- Provides the necessary production, project
       and program management skills and experience necessary to manage client
       engagements.

NEIGHBORHOODS

     Scient has established neighborhoods, or organized communities of interest,
that pursue and develop ideas, focus on quality and efficiency improvements, and
establish points of view to improve colleague and client satisfaction. Scient's
neighborhoods span across its global business units, innovation centers and core
services units to minimize redundancies and maximize colleague team-building,
participation and innovation. As of June 30, 2001, Scient had over 20
neighborhoods, spanning areas of interest such as emerging technologies,
eOrganizational issues and customer relationship management.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

     Scient's knowledge management processes and systems, which Scient refers to
as Knowledge Management, enable the development and re-use of Scient's
intellectual capital. Scient has found that while there are unique features to
each client engagement, there is often a degree of commonality. Scient's focus
on particular industries, business processes and technologies creates
intellectual capital that can be adapted for use in different industries and
applications provided that it is not proprietary to a client. Through the Scient
Approach methodology and its iterative process, Scient expects to capture this
common intellectual capital and develop common frameworks, processes, and
technology to use in the delivery of Scient's services. Knowledge Management is
designed to enable each engagement team to bring the experiences of Scient's
entire company to bear on each client engagement.

     Knowledge Management facilitates access to the Scient Approach methodology
and helps Scient's colleagues determine what services to deliver to clients and
when to perform the services during the different steps of the approach.
Resources available through Knowledge Management include tutorial materials,
templates, expert contacts and sample outputs for the different process steps.

     Scient has invested significantly in Knowledge Management with the intent
that such expenditures will allow Scient to use its intellectual capital in
order to accelerate the delivery of its services, reduce its costs and leverage
its industry experience. However, Scient cannot guarantee that Knowledge
Management will help it achieve these goals or will be adequate to support
Scient's future operations.

COMPETITION

     Competition in the eBusiness services market is intense. Scient competes
against companies selling electronic commerce software and services, including
those offering such products and services on a hosted basis, and the in-house
development efforts of companies seeking to engage in electronic commerce.
Scient's current competitors include the following:

     - Systems integrators that primarily engage in fixed-time/fixed-fee
       contracts, such as Sapient, Cambridge Technology Partners, and Viant;

     - Large systems integrators, such as Accenture and the consulting arms of
       the "Big Five" accounting firms;

     - The professional services groups of computer equipment companies, such as
       IBM;

     - Outsourcing firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation and Electronic
       Data Systems;

     - Web consulting firms and online agencies, such as Agency.com, and
       Proxicom (a subsidiary of Dimension Data);

     - General management consulting firms, such as Bain & Company, Booz Allen &
       Hamilton, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company; and

     - Internal IT departments of current and potential clients.

     Because relatively low barriers to entry characterize Scient's market,
Scient also expects other companies to enter Scient's market.

     Scient believes that the principal competitive factors in Scient's industry
are:

     - Value of services provided compared to the price of services;

     - The quality of services and deliverables, technical and strategic
       expertise, project management capabilities, reputation and experience of
       professionals delivering the service; and

     - The effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition, and
       the size of the firm.

     Scient believes that it presently competes favorably with respect to most
of these factors. In particular, Scient believes that it offers an integrated
set of strategic consulting and customer experience skills and technological
expertise that many existing service providers are not well suited to provide.
However, the market for eBusiness services is highly competitive and Scient
cannot be certain that Scient will compete successfully in the future. Scient
expects that competition will continue to intensify in the future, particularly
as large IT consulting firms focus more resources on eBusiness opportunities.
Because Scient contracts with its clients on an engagement-by-engagement basis,
Scient competes for engagements at each stage of its methodology. There is no
guarantee that Scient will be retained by its existing or future clients on
later stages of work. See "Risk Factors -- We operate in a highly competitive
market with relatively low barriers to entry."

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Scient has developed detailed tools, processes and methodologies underlying
the Scient Approach methodology and software code, scripts, libraries, data
models, applications, business processes, frameworks, and other technology used
internally and in client engagements. Scient currently seeks to protect its
proprietary rights and other intellectual property through a combination of
copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, as well as through
contractual protections such as proprietary information agreements and
nondisclosure agreements. Scient cannot guarantee that the steps it has taken to
protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of
Scient's intellectual property, and Scient may not be able to detect
unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce Scient's intellectual
property rights. See "Risk Factors -- Holdco's ability to protect its
intellectual property is important to its business."

COLLEAGUES AND CORPORATE CULTURE

     Colleagues.  Scient generally uses the term "colleagues" instead of
"employees" to reinforce its one-firm concept and collegial culture. As of June
30, 2001, Scient had a total of 510 colleagues. Of these, 399 were in
professional services and 111 were in core services, including Knowledge
Management, Technology, People, Finance and Administration. Scient has offices
in San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Dallas, TX, Chicago, IL, Boston, MA, London,
England and affiliate offices in Paris, France and Tokyo, Japan. Subsequently,
Scient has undertaken restructuring efforts to reduce its workforce and offices;
these activities are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Scient
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" below. Scient's future success will depend in part on its ability to
attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management
personnel, for whom competition is intense. None of Scient's colleagues is
represented by any collective bargaining unit, and Scient has never experienced
a work stoppage. Scient believes its relations with its colleagues are good.

     Corporate Culture.  Scient believes that developing a rich environment and
a one-firm concept with a shared culture is critical to Scient becoming an
employer of choice for management, strategic, technical, design, sales,
marketing and support professionals of all levels. Scient actively fosters a set
of core values that were developed jointly by management and Scient's
colleagues. These values include a dedication to

maintaining an innovative and empowering environment where Scient works as a
team to achieve total client satisfaction and provide its colleagues with
personal and professional growth opportunities. In addition, Scient believes
that by linking employee compensation to the success of Scient through its
incentive compensation program, Scient encourages an owner attitude, which
Scient believes results in decisions that benefit its clients, colleagues and
the company. Scient believes that its ability to attract and retain high-caliber
colleagues will be in large part dependent on Scient's adherence to a one-firm
culture supported by the following values:

     - Spirit -- Growth

     - Community -- Innovation

     - Excellence -- Urgency

PROPERTIES

     As of March 31, 2001, Scient's headquarters and principal administrative,
finance, sales and marketing operations were located in approximately 83,000
square feet of leased office space in San Francisco, California. In April, 2001,
Scient announced the move of its headquarters to 39,000 square feet of leased
office space in New York, New York. This transition was substantially completed
by July 31, 2001. As of August 15, 2001, Scient also leased additional offices
in New York, NY, as well as offices in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, Boston,
MA, Dallas, TX, Sunnyvale, CA, Paris, France, Tokyo, Japan and London, England.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Scient is not party to any claims or actions that Scient believes could
have a material effect on its result of operations or financial position.

                 SCIENT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements relating to Scient's future financial performance, business strategy,
financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks.
Scient's actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by
these forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors,
including, but not limited to, those contained in the risk factor disclosure set
forth in "Risk Factors," above. The forward-looking statements contained in this
joint proxy statement-prospectus are made only as of the date hereof, and Scient
undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.

OVERVIEW

     Scient's net revenue is derived primarily from providing professional
services to clients who are expanding or reevaluating their existing businesses
to integrate eBusiness capabilities. Although until the quarter ended September
30, 2000, Scient experienced growth in its net revenues, in each quarter since
then Scient has experienced a sequential decline in net revenues quarter to
quarter. Scient believes that the decline in net revenues was primarily due to a
broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients have decreased technology
budgets, increased competitive pressure from traditional management consulting,
information technology services and eBusiness service competitors, and a lack of
urgency by Global 2000 companies to immediately fund large eBusiness projects.

     Scient expects that its net revenues will be driven primarily by the number
and scope of its client engagements, its professional services headcount, and
its ability to appropriately staff those engagements and price its services.
Scient has experienced significant customer concentration and expects such
concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Also, net revenues from
any given client will vary from period to period and often do so significantly.
To the extent that any significant client uses less of Scient's services or
terminates its relationship with Scient, Scient's net revenues could decline
substantially. For example, Scient's net revenues declined in the quarter ended
June 30, 2001 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2001. The loss of any
significant client could seriously harm Scient's business and results of
operations.

     Scient generally provides its services on a time and materials basis. For
the quarter ended June 30, 2001, approximately 91% of net revenue was derived
from time and materials contracts, including completed capped fee engagements
that were billed and recognized on a time and materials basis. Net revenues
pursuant to time and materials contracts are generally recognized as services
are provided. Net revenues pursuant to fixed-fee contracts are generally
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting (based on the
ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs). Net revenue excludes
reimbursable expenses charged to clients.

     Professional services expenses consist primarily of compensation and
benefits for Scient's colleagues involved with the delivery of professional
services. Professional services margins reflect net revenues for services less
professional services expenses. Scient expects that its per capita professional
services expenses will increase over time due to wage increases and inflation.
Scient's professional services margins are affected by the number of work days
in a period and level of billability, defined as the percentage of professional
services employees' time that is billed to clients, and such margins will vary
in the future. Billability for the three months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 was
11% and 75%, respectively. This decline was primarily due to overcapacity of
professional services personnel in light of decreasing market demand for
Scient's services. Any significant decline in fees billed to clients, the loss
of one or more significant clients, or the failure to match the level of client
demand for Scient's services with its professional services capacity without a
corresponding decline in professional services expenses, would have a material
adverse effect on Scient's professional services margins. In addition, as a
matter of business development and client relationship management, Scient has
provided and expects to continue to provide, limited services to certain clients
without compensation for Scient's professional services fees. Any increase in
this activity in a particular quarter would have a material

adverse effect on professional service margins. Client engagements currently
average three to six months' duration. At the end of any engagement, Scient must
re-deploy professional services personnel. Any resulting unbillable time from
such re-deployments will adversely affect professional services margins.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries,
commissions, and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales and marketing;
salaries and related expenses for recruiting, human resources, knowledge
management, information technology, finance, legal and administrative personnel;
office facilities and information technology expenditures; professional fees;
trade shows; promotional expenses; and other general corporate expenses.

     Net Revenues

     Net revenues decreased 88% in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 compared to
the quarter ended June 30, 2000. This decrease resulted primarily from a
broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients have significantly
tightened technology budgets, increased competitive pressure from traditional
management consulting, information technology services and eBusiness service
competitors and a lack of urgency by Global 2000 companies to immediately fund
large eBusiness projects. As a result of the decline in demand for its services,
Scient saw a significant decrease in the number of clients and the scope of
engagements. For the three months ended June 30, 2001, Scient's five largest
clients accounted for approximately 49% of Scient's net revenues, compared to
30% of net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2000. During the three
months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, one client accounted for 13% and 6% of net
revenues, respectively. Scient's net revenues for the quarter ended June 30,
2001 declined 58% compared to Scient's net revenues for the quarter ended March
31, 2001. Scient believes that the decline in net revenues was primarily due to
the factors cited above.

     Operating Expenses

     Professional Services.  Scient's professional service expenses decreased
65% in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 compared to the quarter ended June 30,
2000. This decrease was primarily a result of Scient's restructuring activities
in December 2000 and April 2001, which resulted in a significant decrease in
professional services colleagues in response to the declines in the number of
Scient's clients and the scope of Scient's engagements during that time frame.
Professional services expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 118%
for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from 42% for the three months ended
June 30, 2000, due primarily to lower utilization of professional services
colleagues and significantly lower net revenue.

     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased 70% in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 compared to the
quarter ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was also primarily due to Scient's
restructuring activities in December 2000 and April 2001, which resulted in a
significant decrease in Scient's core service colleagues and general
administrative expenses incurred by Scient's core service departments. Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to
127% for the three months ended June 30, 2001, as compared to 52% for the three
months ended June 30, 2000, due to net revenue for the quarter ended June 30,
2001 being lower than was expected at the outset of the quarter.

     Restructuring and Other Related Charges.  In April 2001, Scient recorded a
restructuring and other related charges of $50 million, consisting of $34
million for headcount reductions, $4 million for consolidation of facilities and
related fixed assets, and $12 million of other related restructuring charges.
These restructuring and other related charges were taken to align Scient's cost
structure with changing market conditions and decreased demand for Scient's
services and to create a more flexible and efficient organization. The plan
resulted in headcount reduction of approximately 850 colleagues, which was made
up of 78% professional services staff, and 22% core services staff. The April
2001 restructuring included plans to significantly downsize and modify Scient's
geographic footprint and move its corporate headquarters to New York from San
Francisco. In addition, Scient closed its Los Angeles and New Jersey offices,
divested approximately 80% of its interests in each of its French and Japanese
subsidiaries and plans to reduce its San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago
locations to smaller sales offices.

     Total cash outlays for the December 2000 and April 2001 restructuring and
other related activities will be approximately $112 million. The remaining $43
million of restructuring and other related costs consists of non-cash charges
primarily for asset write-offs. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal
2002, $67 million of cash has been used for restructuring and other related
costs. An additional $19 million cash outlay is expected in the second quarter
of fiscal 2002, and the remaining cash outlay of approximately $26 million,
primarily related to real estate rental obligations, is expected to occur over
the next 10 years.

     Stock Compensation.  Scient has recorded stock compensation for the
difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the
deemed fair value of Scient's common stock at the time of such grants. Scient is
amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options,
resulting in amortization expense of $1.2 million and $2.9 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 respectively.

     Interest and Other Income, Net

     Interest and other income, net, decreased 49% in the quarter ended June 30,
2001 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was due
primarily to lower average balances of investment funds and interest bearing
funds in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 compared to the quarter ended June 30,
2000. These lower balances resulted primarily from Scient's restructuring
activities and declining business environment, which required significant
expenditures of cash since the quarter ended June 30, 2000.

     Provision for Income Taxes

     Scient has incurred losses from inception through quarter ended June 30,
2001. As of June 30, 2001, Scient had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards to offset future taxable income which expire in

varying amounts beginning in 2020 and 2008, respectively. Management believes
that, based on the history of such losses and other factors, it is more likely
than not that Scient will not be able to realize its deferred tax assets and
thus a full valuation reserve has been recorded. The effective income tax rate
differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the
inability to recognize the benefit of net operating losses.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Scient has primarily funded its operations from cash flow generated from
operations and the proceeds from its public stock offerings. Cash used in
operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 was $40.9
million and $30.2 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2001 Scient had $115.1
million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments
compared to $161.1 million at March 31, 2001.

     Cash provided in investing activities was $25.2 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2001. This was due primarily to capital expenditures of
approximately $5.4 million offset by sale of assets of $1.5 million and maturity
or sale of short-term investments, net of $29.2 million. Cash used in investing
activities was $6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000 consisting
of the purchase of investments of $1.6 million and capital expenditures of
approximately $4.7 million. Scient invests predominantly in instruments that are
highly liquid, investment grade securities and have maturity of less than one
year. These expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvement and furniture
and fixtures.

     Cash used by financing activities was $9.3 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2001 and primarily consisted of capital lease payments of $1.1
million and an increase in restricted cash balance of $8.1 million. Cash
provided by financing activities was $2.9 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2000 and was primarily derived from proceeds from the exercise of
common stock options of $5.8 million, offset by repayment of Scient's
outstanding loan balance of $2.2 million.

     Scient has a revolving line of credit of $50.0 million. Borrowings under
this line of credit bear interest at either the LIBOR rate plus a range of 2.25%
to 2.75% or the bank's prime rate plus up to 0.5% depending on the outstanding
balance and the type of draws. As of June 30, 2001, there were no outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit. Fifteen standby letters of credit totaling
$39.6 million have been issued against this line of credit.

     Scient calculates average days' sales outstanding ("DSO") based on average
account receivables for the period divided by average daily sales for that
equivalent period. Scient's DSO has increased significantly from the prior
annual period primarily as a result of lower average daily sales and longer
payment time of Scient's customers.

     Scient believes that its current cash balance and cash generated from
operations will be sufficient to fund its current anticipated cash needs through
the next 12 months. To the extent Scient is unable to fund its operations from
cash flows, Scient may need to obtain financing in the form of either additional
equity or indebtedness. There can be no assurance that additional financing will
be available on terms acceptable to Scient, if at all.

  Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2000

     Revenues

     In fiscal year 2001, Scient reported revenues of $300.2 million, a 93%
increase compared to $155.7 million in fiscal year ended March 31, 2000. This
increase resulted primarily from growth during the first half of fiscal year
2001 in Scient's client base, broader engagement scopes, and billing rate
increases. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, Scient's five largest
clients accounted for approximately 36% of its revenues, compared to 27% of
revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000. During the year ended March
31, 2001, one client accounted for 11% of revenues. For the year ended March 31,
2000, no client accounted for more than 10% of revenues.

     Cost of Professional Services

     Professional services costs consist primarily of compensation and benefits
for Scient's colleagues involved with the delivery of professional services. For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, professional services expenses totaled
$149.3 million, a 113% increase compared to $70.2 million in fiscal 2000. This
increase was primarily a result of Scient's hiring of professional services
colleagues in response to greater demand for services earlier in the fiscal
year. Billable colleagues grew from 828 at March 31, 2000 to 1,324 at September
30, 2000. Scient ended fiscal year 2001 with 964 billable colleagues, reflecting
the restructuring actions taken in December 2000. For the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001, professional services costs as a percentage of revenue increased
to 50% compared to 45% for fiscal year 2000. Professional services costs
increased at a faster rate than revenue in fiscal 2001, resulting in a reduction
in gross margin to 50% compared to 55% for the twelve months ended March 31,
2000.

     Operating Expenses

     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses more than doubled in the year ended March 31, 2001 to $182.6 million
compared to $90.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000. These
increases were primarily due to expenses related to the addition of sales,
marketing, recruiting, knowledge management, information technology, finance,
legal and administration personnel, bad debt expense, and costs of leasing
additional office space to support the growth that Scient experienced in the
first half of the fiscal year. Expenses related to bad debt increased
significantly for the year ended March 31, 2001. This increase was primarily due
to the increased financial problems and lack of funding experienced by Scient's
venture-backed clients. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue increased to 61% from 58% for the year ended March 31,
2001.

     Restructuring and Other Related Charges.  On December 6, 2000, Scient
announced a restructuring initiative designed to reduce capacity and align its
business to the rapidly changing market environment. Under this plan, Scient
eliminated approximately 460 positions and closed offices in Austin, Texas,
Sunnyvale, California and Germany. Subsequently, on April 11, 2001, Scient
announced an additional restructuring initiative that included a planned
reduction in force of up to approximately 850 people. The April restructuring
included plans to significantly downsize and modify Scient's geographic
footprint and move its corporate headquarters to New York from San Francisco. In
addition, Scient closed its Los Angeles and New Jersey offices, divested 80% of
its interests in each of its French and Japanese subsidiaries and plans to
reduce its San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago locations to smaller sales
offices. Scient is in the process of reviewing several other offices to
determine appropriate actions, including possible closing or downsizing as
market conditions warrant. For the year ended March 31, 2001, Scient recorded
restructuring and other related charges of $105 million. Of the total
restructuring charge of $105 million, $14 million was related to headcount
reductions, $81 million was for consolidation and abandonment of facilities and
related fixed assets, and $10 million was associated with other restructuring
related charges. These restructuring and other related charges were taken to
align Scient's cost structure with changing market conditions and decreased
demand for Scient's services as well as to create a more flexible and efficient
organization.

     Total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities will
be approximately $71 million. The remaining $34 million of restructuring and
other related costs consists of non-cash charges primarily for asset write-offs.
As of the end of the year of fiscal 2001, $25 million of cash was used for
restructuring and other related costs. Approximately $11 million cash outlay is
expected in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, and the remaining cash outlay of
approximately $35 million, primarily related to real estate rental obligations,
is expected to occur over the next 10 years.

     Amortization of Intangibles.  Amortization of intangible assets consists of
amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of AXIDIA, a French
eBusiness services firm, in August 2000. Amortization of these costs for the
year ended March 31, 2001 was $4.7 million. There was no amortization cost
related to intangible assets for year ended March 31, 2000. Intangible assets
related to the AXIDIA acquisition are amortized on a straight line basis over
two years. Amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue was 2%
for the year ended March 31, 2001, with no amortization in the comparable period
of the prior year.

     Stock Compensation.  Scient has recorded stock compensation for the
difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the
deemed fair value of Scient's common stock at the time of such grants. Scient is
amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options,
resulting in amortization expense of $9.4 million and $15.6 million for the year
ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The actual amounts that Scient
recognizes will be reduced to the extent that the affected options are cancelled
before they become fully vested. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Interest and Other Income, Net

     Interest and other income, net, increased 116% in the year ended March 31,
2001 compared to the year ended March 31, 2000. This increase was due primarily
to larger investment funds and higher interest bearing funds resulting from
Scient's investing activities during the quarter ended December 31, 2000. In
addition, the average balance of Scient's investment is higher due to proceeds
from its public offerings in the prior fiscal year.

     Provision for Income Taxes

     From March 31, 2000 through March 31, 2001, Scient incurred net losses for
federal and state tax purposes and has not recognized any tax provision or
benefit. As of March 31, 2000 and 2001, Scient had approximately $18 million and
$44 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available and $23
million and $50 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to
offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2020
and 2008, respectively. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in
certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amount of net
operating losses that Scient may utilize in any one year include, but are not
limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over a
three year period.

     Scient has incurred losses from inception through March 31, 1998 and for
the year ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Management believes that, based on
the history of such losses and other factors, the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that Scient will not be able to
realize its deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation reserve has been
recorded at March 31, 2000 and 2001. The effective income tax rate differs from
the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the inability to
recognize the benefit of net operating losses.

  Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2000 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 1999

     Revenues

     The increase in revenues in the year ended March 31, 2000 compared to March
31, 1999 reflected the increase in the number of clients and wider scope of
engagements during the year ended March 31, 2000 as a result of Scient's
increased capacity due to increased investment in its sales and professional
services organizations.

     Operating Expenses

     Professional Services.  Scient's professional services expenses increased
in absolute dollars in the year ended March 31, 2000 compared to March 31, 1999
primarily as a result of increases in the number of professional services
personnel.

     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased in absolute dollars in the year ended March 31, 2000 compared
to March 31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to the
addition of sales, marketing, recruiting, knowledge management, technology,
finance and administration personnel, and the cost of leasing additional office
space to support Scient's global growth.

     Stock Compensation.  For the year ended March 31, 1999 and March 31, 2000,
Scient recorded aggregate unearned stock compensation of $35.0 million and $40.2
million, respectively, in connection with

stock option grants. Stock compensation expense is being recognized over the
vesting period of the related options (generally four years). For the year ended
March 31, 1999 and March 31, 2000, Scient recognized stock compensation of $7.7
million and $15.6 million, respectively. This increase was primarily a result of
increases in the number of options granted due to increased hiring of employees
and the comparison of a full year period to a partial year period. The actual
amounts that Scient recognizes will be reduced to the extent that the affected
options are cancelled before they become fully vested. See Note 11 of Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Interest Income and Other, Net

     Interest income increased in the year ended March 31, 2000 compared to the
year ended March 31, 1999. This increase was due primarily to higher interest
bearing funds resulting from Scient's public financing activities during fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000.

     Provision for Income Taxes

     From March 31, 1999 through March 31, 2000, Scient incurred net losses for
federal and state tax purposes and has not recognized any tax provision or
benefit. As of March 31, 2000, Scient had approximately $40.5 million of federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income which
expire in varying amounts beginning in 2019 and 2007, respectively. Under the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss
carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which
cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that Scient may utilize
in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change
of more than 50%, as defined, over a three year period.

     Scient has incurred losses from inception through March 31, 1998 and for
the year ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Management believes that, based on
the history of such losses and other factors, the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that Scient will not be able to
realize its deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation reserve has been
recorded at March 31, 1999 and 2000. The effective income tax rate differs from
the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the inability to
recognize the benefit of net operating losses.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following table sets forth unaudited consolidated quarterly financial
data from the periods indicated. Scient derived this from consolidated financial
statements, and, in the opinion of Scient's management, they include all
adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
present fairly the financial results for the periods. Results of operations for
any previous fiscal quarter do not necessarily indicate what results may be for
any future period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Scient has primarily funded its operations from cash flow generated from
operations and the proceeds from its public stock offerings. Scient raised $62.7
million in May 1999 from an initial public offering of 6.9 million shares of its
common stock, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and issuance costs.
Scient then raised an additional $154.3 million in January 2000 from a follow-on
public offering of 1.85 million shares of its common stock, net of underwriting
discounts, commissions and issuance costs. Cash used in operating activities for
the year ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $66.3 million, $6.6 million,
and $4.6 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2001 Scient had $161.1 million
in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments
compared to $229.1 million at March 31, 2000.

     Cash provided by/(used in) investing activities for the year ended March
31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $64.5 million, ($118.4) million, and ($19.2)
million, respectively. The results for fiscal year 2001 include the net write
down of property and equipment for $3.3 million and the sale or maturing of
short-term investments, which generated $69.0 million in cash. This was offset
by the cash portion of the AXIDIA acquisition of $7.7 million. Scient invests
predominantly in instruments that are highly liquid, investment grade securities
and have maturities of less than one year. Capital expenditures for the year
ended March 31, 2000 and 1999 were approximately $11.1 million and $2.4 million,
respectively. These expenditures were primarily for computer equipment,
software, and furniture and fixtures.

     Cash provided by/(used in) financing activities for the year ended March
31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was ($13.7) million, $221.8 million, and $31.7 million,
respectively. Fiscal year 2001 cash used in financing activities primarily
consisted of restricted cash outflow of $18.6 million used as a collateral for
Scient's existing line of credit offset by cash received for the exercise of
options to acquire common stock of $13.5 million. Cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999 was primarily
derived from proceeds for the sale of common stock through Scient's public
offerings of $217.0 million.

     Scient has a revolving line of credit of $50.0 million. Borrowings under
this line of credit bear interest at either the LIBOR rate plus a range of 2.25%
to 2.75% or the bank's prime rate plus up to 0.5% depending on the outstanding
balance and the type of draws. As of June 30, 2001, there were no outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit. Fifteen standby letters of credit totaling
$39.6 million have been issued against this line of credit.

     Scient calculates average days' sales outstanding ("DSO") based on average
account receivables for the period divided by average daily sales for that
equivalent period. Scient's DSO declined to 53 days in fiscal year 2001 from 67
days in fiscal year 2000. The decrease was due to lower average daily sales in
fiscal year 2000. However, DSO increased significantly on a quarter to quarter
basis throughout fiscal year 2001 due to increased payment cycle of larger
enterprise clients. Scient anticipates that this trend towards an increase in
DSO will continue in the near future as Scient's average daily sales remain flat
or decline further.

     Scient's believes that current cash balance and cash generated from
operations will be sufficient to fund its current anticipated cash needs through
at least the next 12 months. To the extent Scient is unable to fund its
operations from cash flows, Scient may need to obtain financing in the form of
either additional equity or indebtedness. There can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to Scient, if at all.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 141, "Business Combinations." This Statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for business combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 38,
"Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises." All
business combinations in the scope of this Statement are to be accounted for
using one method, the purchase method. The provisions of this Statement apply to
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and all business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method for which the date of
acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. Scient has engaged in significant
acquisition activity in the past, including business combinations, and future
business

combinations are likely. The provisions of this Statement would require all
future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method.

     In June 2001, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets." This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for (i) intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets
(but not those acquired in a business combination)at acquisition and (ii)
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This
Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. Under the provisions
of this Statement, if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite
useful life, it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be
no longer indefinite. An intangible asset that is not subject to amortization
shall be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill shall not
be amortized. Goodwill shall be tested for impairment on an annual basis and
between annual tests in certain circumstances at a level of reporting referred
to as a reporting unit. This Statement is required to be applied starting with
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001 will be subject immediately to the nonamortization
and amortization provisions of this Statement. Scient is evaluating the impact
of adopting these pronouncements on the financial statements.

       SCIENT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Scient cash equivalents and short-term investments are exposed to financial
market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest
income and the fair market value of our investments. Scient manages its exposure
to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of its investment
portfolio and investing in short-term investment-grade securities. These
securities are highly liquid and generally mature within 12 months from Scient's
purchase date. Due to the short maturities of Scient's investments, the carrying
value approximates the fair value. In addition, Scient does not use its
investments for trading or other speculative purposes.

     Scient has performed an analysis to assess the potential effect of
reasonably possible near-term changes in interest and foreign currency exchange
rates. The effect of such rate changes is not expected to be material to
Scient's results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

     As of June 30, 2001, Scient's cash included money market securities. Due to
the short duration of Scient's investment portfolio, an immediate 10% change in
interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of
Scient's portfolio. Therefore, Scient would not expect its operating results or
cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden
change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio.

SCIENT STOCK OPTION INFORMATION

     The following table sets forth for each of the Scient named executive
officers who will serve as a director or executive officer of Holdco the options
we granted under our 1999 Equity Incentive Plan during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001. Generally, these options are exercisable in installments, and
the optionee vests in 25% of the option shares upon completion of 12 months of
service from the vesting start date and vests in the balance in a series of
equal monthly installments over the next three years of service. However, the
options granted to Mr. Mucchetti with an expiration date of December 19, 2010
vested in 25% of the option shares on January 23, 2001 and vest in the balance
in a series of equal monthly installments over the next three years of service.
Each of the options has a 10-year term, subject to earlier termination upon the
optionee's cessation of service. The percentages in the column entitled "% of
Total Options Granted to Employees in Fiscal Year" are based on an aggregate of
20,615,621 shares under options that Scient granted to its employees under the
1999 Equity Incentive Plan and 2000 Stock Plan during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001.

     The amounts listed in the following table under the heading "Exercise or
Base Price Per Share" were equal to the fair market value of Scient's common
stock as determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grant. "Fair market
value" means the market price of Scient's stock, determined in good faith on an
appropriate basis. Whenever possible, the determination of fair market value is
based on the prices reported in The Wall Street Journal. The optionee may pay
the exercise price by using cash, shares of common stock that the optionee
already owns, an immediate sale of the option shares through a broker approved
by Scient, or a pledge of the option shares, through a broker approved by
Scient, as security for a loan.

     Scient calculated the amounts listed in the following table under the
heading "Potential Realizable Value at Assumed Annual Rates of Stock Price
Appreciation for Option Term" based on the 10-year term of the option at the
time of grant. For purposes of these columns, Scient assumed stock price
appreciation of 5% and 10% pursuant to rules promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. These rates of appreciation do not represent Scient's
prediction of its stock price performance. Scient calculated the potential
realizable values at 5% and 10% appreciation by assuming that the estimated fair
market value on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated rate for the
entire term of the option and that the option is exercised at the exercise price
and sold on the last day of its term at the appreciated price. Information on
how Scient determined the fair market value of its common stock is disclosed in
the preceding paragraph. There can be no assurance provided to any executive
officer or any other holder of Scient's securities that the actual stock price
appreciation over the 10-year option term will be at the assumed 5% and 10%
levels or at any other defined level. Unless the market price of the common
stock appreciates over the option term, no value will be realized from the
option grants made to the executive officers.

REPORT OF THE SCIENT COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     The Compensation Committee of Scient's Board of Directors (the "Committee")
is responsible for establishing the level of base salary payable and for
approving the individual incentive program to be in effect for Scient's Chief
Executive Officer. In addition, the Committee is responsible for the design and
administration of Scient's 1997 Stock Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, 2000
Stock Plan, and 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Chief Executive Officer
has the authority to establish the level of base salary payable and for
approving the incentive programs to be in effect each fiscal year for all other
colleagues of Scient, including all members of senior management, subject to the
approval of the Committee.

     The compensation philosophy of Scient is the same for all levels of
colleagues. To determine senior management compensation levels, Scient works
with an independent compensation-consulting firm that provides executive
compensation data drawn from the proxy statements of companies doing similar
work and with an emphasis on companies in the eBusiness industry. A significant
number of these companies are listed in the Chase H&Q Technology Index, which is
included in the Scient Performance Graph for this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. In addition, data from nationally recognized compensation
surveys is used.

     General Compensation Policy.  Scient's fundamental pay philosophy is to
offer Scient's senior management competitive compensation opportunities based
upon overall Scient performance, and personal performance. All colleagues,
including senior management, are measured on contributions to clients,
colleagues and Scient. It is Scient's objective to have a substantial portion of
each manager's compensation contingent upon Scient's performance, as well as
upon his or her own level of performance. Accordingly, each senior manager's
compensation package consists of (i) base salary, (ii) cash incentive awards,
and (iii) long-term stock-based incentive awards.

     In preparing the performance graph for this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, Scient selected the NASDAQ Stock Market-U.S. Index and the
Chase H&Q Technology Index. The companies included in Scient's surveys are not
necessarily those included in these indices, because Scient believes that some
of the latter do not compete with Scient for the management talent or because
compensation information was not available to Scient.

     Base Salary.  The base salary for each senior manager is set on the basis
of personal performance and the salary level in effect for comparable position
at companies that compete with Scient for management talent on the basis of
surveys conducted by Scient. In general, Scient seeks to set base salaries at
the 50th percentile of its identified market.

     Annual Cash Incentives.  Each senior manager has an established bonus
target each fiscal year. The actual payment of incentive awards for senior
management is determined on the basis of Scient's achievement of the performance
targets established at the start of the fiscal year and based on personal
performance. Specifically, goals are established at the beginning of the fiscal
year using an agreed-upon business plan that reflects Scient revenue, profit,
client and colleague satisfaction and the manager's individual objectives. Each
fiscal year, the annual incentive plan is reevaluated with a new achievement
threshold and new goals. Actual incentive awards paid reflect an individual's
accomplishment of both corporate and functional objectives, with greater weight
being given to achievement of corporate rather than functional objectives.
Actual bonuses are listed in the Summary Compensation Table for the Named
Executive Officers.

     Long-Term Incentive Compensation.  During fiscal year 2001, the Committee
made no option grants to Mr. Howe, Scient's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. Grants were made to Mr. Mucchetti, Scient's President and Chief
Operating Officer. These grants were in keeping with grants made to all
colleagues in good standing as part of the long-term incentive to align
colleagues' interest with stockholder interest and enable them to share in the
growth of the business. The details of the grants are reflected in the Option
Grant Table. Generally, a significant grant is made in the year that a colleague
commences employment. Smaller grants may be made in subsequent years or no
options may be granted. Generally, the size of each grant is set at a level that
the Committee deems appropriate to create a meaningful opportunity for stock
ownership, based upon the individual's position with Scient, the individual's
potential for future responsibility, and the individual's performance in the
recent period. The total number of option shares granted to each individual is

considered as well. The relative weight given to each of these factors will vary
from individual to individual at the Committee's discretion.

     Chief Executive Officer Compensation.  The annual base salary for Mr. Howe
was established by the Committee on February 9, 1998. The Committee's decision
was made primarily on the basis of Mr. Howe's extensive background and
experience. During the last fiscal year, the Committee granted Mr. Howe a merit
increase based on the excellent record of Scient in Mr. Howe's first two years
with Scient. However, when it became clear that Scient was being impacted by the
decline in its marketplace, Mr. Howe asked the Committee to cancel his merit
increase, and the Committee agreed. Other members of the senior management team
also took a voluntary pay reduction.

     The remaining components of the Chief Executive Officer's fiscal 2001
incentive compensation were entirely dependent upon Scient's performance and
provided no dollar guarantees. In light of the results achieved, it was
determined that no bonuses would be paid to anyone for the fiscal year 2001.

     Tax Limitation.  As a result of Federal tax legislation enacted in 1993, a
publicly held company such as Scient is not allowed a Federal income tax
deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers to the extent that
compensation exceeds $1 million per officer in any year. This limitation is in
effect for all fiscal years of Scient ending after Scient's initial public
offering. The stockholders approved Scient's stock plans available to executive
officers, which include a provision that limits the maximum number of options
that any one participant may be granted per calendar year. Accordingly, any
compensation deemed paid to an executive officer when he or she exercises an
option with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the option
shares on the grant date generally will qualify as performance-based
compensation that will not be subject to the $1 million limitation.

     Since it is not expected that the cash compensation to be paid to Scient's
executive officers for the 2002 fiscal year will exceed the $1 million limit per
officer, the Committee will defer any decision on whether to limit the dollar
amount of the cash compensation payable to Scient's executive officers to the $1
million cap.

SCIENT COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS

     The Compensation Committee of Scient's Board was formed in February 1998
and is currently comprised of Messrs. Gluck and Leone. None of these individuals
was at any time during fiscal 2001, or at any other time, an officer or employee
of Scient. No member of the Compensation Committee of Scient serves as a member
of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one
or more executive officers serving as a member of the Scient's Board of
Directors or Compensation Committee.

SCIENT EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     Scient has entered into an employment agreement, dated February 9, 1998,
with Robert M. Howe, Scient's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which
provides for an annual base salary of at least $250,000, an annual bonus at the
discretion of the board of directors and participation in Scient's employee
benefit plans. The employment agreement also provides that Scient will pay Mr.
Howe a lump sum equal to 100% of the greater of (1) his then current annual base
compensation or (2) his actual base compensation plus bonus for the most
recently completed fiscal year if Scient terminates Mr. Howe without his consent
for any reason other than for cause or permanent disability. In addition, Scient
granted Mr. Howe an immediately exercisable option to purchase 4,800,000 shares
of Scient common stock upon commencement of his employment, subject to Scient's
right of repurchase which lapses pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule.
Scient's repurchase right will lapse upon completion of the merger. All Scient
stock options will become fully exercisable immediately prior to the merger and
will terminate upon completion of the merger to the extent not exercised.

     Scient has entered into an employment agreement, dated September 14, 1998,
with Stephen A. Mucchetti, Scient's President and Chief Operating Officer, which
provides for an annual base salary of at least $250,000, an annual bonus of
$50,000 for his first two years at Scient and participation in Scient's employee
benefit plans. In addition, Scient granted Mr. Mucchetti an option to purchase
1,000,000 shares of Scient common stock upon commencement of his employment, of
which 20% was immediately vested and the remainder is subject to Scient's right
of repurchase, which will lapse upon completion of the merger. All Scient stock
options will become fully exercisable immediately prior to the merger and will
terminate upon completion of the merger to the extent not exercised. The
employment agreement provides that if Scient terminates Mr. Mucchetti, Scient
will pay him a lump sum equal to one year's salary, and he will vest in 12
months of stock options.

                            SCIENT PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The graph set forth below compares the cumulative total stockholder return
on Scient's common stock between May 14, 1999 (the date Scient's common stock
commenced public trading) and March 31, 2001 with the cumulative total return of
(1) the CRSP Total Return Index for the Nasdaq Stock Market (US Companies) (the
"Nasdaq Stock Market-U.S. Index") and (2) the JP Morgan H & Q Technology Index,
over the same period. This graph assumes the investment of $100.00 on May 14,
1999 in Scient's common stock, the Nasdaq Stock Market-U.S. Index and the JP
Morgan H & Q Technology Index, and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if
any.

     The comparisons shown in the graph below are based upon historical data.
Scient cautions that the stock price performance shown in the graph below is not
indicative of, nor intended to forecast, the potential future performance of
Scient's common stock. Information used in the graph was obtained from Research
Data Group, a source believed to be reliable, but Scient is not responsible for
any errors or omissions in such information.

     Scient effected its initial public offering of common stock on May 14, 1999
at a price of $10 per share (as adjusted to reflect its December 1999
two-for-one forward stock split).

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of Scient's
previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that might incorporate this joint
proxy statement-prospectus or future filings made by Scient under those
statutes, Scient's Compensation Committee Report and Scient Performance Graph

 (1) Beneficial ownership includes shares of common stock over which the named
     person has either sole or shared investment or voting power and is based on
     information contained in documents publicly filed by the named person with
     the SEC, publicly available information or information available to us.

     purchased by the holder by exercise of options granted under Scient's stock

     In computing the percentage ownership of a person, shares of common stock

                    SCIENT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

     Since April 1, 2000 there has not been, nor is there currently proposed,
any transaction or series of similar transactions to which Scient or any of its
subsidiaries was or is to be a party in which the amount involved exceeded or
will exceed $60,000 and in which any director, executive officer, holder of more
than 5% of the common stock of Scient or any member of the immediate family of
any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material
interest other than (1) compensation agreements and other arrangements, which
are described elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus in the section
entitled "Scient Management -- Scient Employment Agreements," and (2) the
transactions described below.

     Scient's certificate of incorporation limits the liability of its directors
for monetary damages arising from a breach of their fiduciary duty as directors,
except to the extent otherwise required by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Such limitation of liability does not affect the availability of equitable
remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.

     Scient's bylaws provide that Scient shall indemnify its directors and
officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, including in
circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under Delaware
law. Scient has also entered into indemnification agreements with its officers
and directors containing provisions that may require Scient to, among other
things, indemnify such officers and directors against certain liabilities that
may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers and to
advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to
which they could be indemnified.

     In August 2000, Scient made an investment in Twelve Entrepreneuring, Inc.
in the amount of $2,000,007. Mr. Greenberg, one of Scient's directors, was then
the co-Chairman and co-CEO of Twelve Entrepreneuring and is currently its
Chairman Emeritus.

     Mr. Howe, Scient's Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer, is also a
director of two of Scient's clients. Mr. Howe is a member of the boards of
directors of the Development Bank of Singapore and S.C. Johnson Commercial
Markets. Scient recognized $8,665,000 in revenue for the year ended March 31,
2001 from transactions with the Development Bank of Singapore. Scient recognized
$5,472,000 in revenue for the year ended March 31, 2001 from transactions with
S.C. Johnson Commercial Markets. The terms and conditions of such transactions
were normal and customary. Balances due from the Development Bank of Singapore
as of March 31, 2001 were $3,352,000. Balances due from S.C. Johnson Commercial
Markets as of March 31, 2001 were $2,853,000.

     Scient believes that all of the transactions set forth above were made on
terms no less favorable to Scient than Scient could have obtained from
unaffiliated third parties.

                      DESCRIPTION OF HOLDCO CAPITAL STOCK

     This section of the joint proxy statement-prospectus describes the material
terms of the capital stock of Holdco under the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws that will be in effect immediately after the merger is completed. This
section also summarizes relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, which we refer to as "Delaware law." The terms of the Holdco certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, as well as the terms of Delaware law, are more
detailed than the general information provided below. Therefore, you should
carefully consider the actual provisions of these documents. The Holdco
certificate of incorporation is attached as Annex G to this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, and the Holdco bylaws are attached as Annex H to this
joint proxy statement-prospectus.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     Total Shares.  Holdco initially will have authority to issue a total of
510,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of:

     - 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share;

     - 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per
       share.

     Common Stock.  Following completion of the merger, we anticipate that
approximately 47,274,313 shares of Holdco common stock will be outstanding.

     Listing.  Holdco intends to apply to list its common stock on the Nasdaq
Stock Market under the current Scient symbol "SCNT." No other capital stock of
Holdco will be listed.

     Preemptive Rights.  The holders of Holdco common stock will not have
preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any stock or other securities of
Holdco.

HOLDCO COMMON STOCK

     Voting Rights.  Each outstanding share of Holdco common stock will be
entitled to one vote per share.

     Dividends.  Holders of Holdco common stock will be entitled to receive
dividends or other distributions when and if declared by the Holdco board of
directors. The right of the Holdco board of directors to declare dividends,
however, will be subject to the availability of sufficient funds under Delaware
law to pay dividends.

     Liquidation Rights.  In the event of the liquidation of Holdco, subject to
any future holders of Holdco preferred stock, the holders of Holdco common stock
will be entitled to receive the assets of Holdco available for distribution to
its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them.

     Classified Board.  Holdco's bylaws will separate the directors into three
classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist as
nearly as may be possible of one-third of the total directors constituting the
entire board of directors. Each director will serve for a three year term ending
on the date of the third annual meeting of stockholders next following the
annual meeting at which such director was elected.

HOLDCO WARRANTS

     When the merger is complete, existing warrants to acquire the common stock
of iXL will be automatically exchanged for warrants to purchase the number of
shares of Holdco common stock that is equal to the product of 0.25 multiplied by
the number of shares of iXL common stock that would have been obtained before
the merger upon exercise of such warrants, rounded to the nearest whole share.
The exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per share of
iXL common stock subject to the warrant before the conversion, divided by 0.25.

     The following is a summary of those warrants, as will exist following the
merger:

     - General Electric Capital Corporation has the right to purchase 125,000
       shares of Holdco common stock at an exercise price of $40.00 per share.
       This warrant is fully vested and may be exercised at any time prior to
       November 3, 2001.

     - GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc., has the right to purchase 250,000
       shares of Holdco common stock at an exercise price of $60.00 per share.
       This warrant is fully vested and may be exercised at any time prior to
       April 7, 2002.

     - GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc., has the right to purchase 375,000
       shares of Holdco common stock at an exercise price of $48.00 per share.

       stock at an exercise price of $5.60 per share. This warrant will be fully

       any time prior to April 5, 2003.

                  COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDCO STOCKHOLDERS,
                   IXL STOCKHOLDERS, AND SCIENT STOCKHOLDERS

     Holdco, iXL and Scient are each organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of Holdco common
stock, iXL common stock and Scient common stock arise primarily from differences
in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws and rights agreements
then in effect. Upon completion of the merger, holders of iXL common stock and
holders of Scient common stock will become holders of Holdco common stock and
their rights will be governed by Delaware law, the Holdco certificate of
incorporation and the Holdco bylaws.

     This section of the proxy statement-prospectus describes the material
differences between the rights of iXL stockholders and Scient stockholders. This
section also includes a brief description of the material rights that Holdco
stockholders are expected to have following completion of the merger, although
in some cases the board of directors of Holdco retains the discretion to alter
those rights without stockholder consent. This section does not include a
complete description of all differences among the rights of these stockholders,
nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights of these
stockholders. In addition, the identification of some of the differences in the
rights of these stockholders as material is not intended to indicate that other
differences that are equally important do not exist. All iXL stockholders and
Scient stockholders are urged to read carefully the relevant provisions of
Delaware law, as well as the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of each of
iXL, Scient and Holdco. Copies of the forms of certificate of incorporation and
bylaws for Holdco are attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as
Annexes G and H, respectively. Copies of the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws of iXL and Scient will be sent to iXL stockholders and Scient
stockholders, as applicable, upon request. See "Where You Can Find More
Information."

bylaws to change the size of the board of directors.

     Under Delaware law, stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights for
the election of directors unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation
so provides. iXL's certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative
voting.

     iXL's certificate of incorporation provides that for so long as Kelso
Investment Associates V, L.P. or Kelso Equity Partners V, L.P., or any

cumulative voting.

     Scient's certificate of incorporation separates the directors into three
classes. One-third of the directors are elected each year and each director
serves for a three year term.

     Holdco.  The board of directors of Holdco initially will consist of eight
members. Holdco's bylaws will provide that the Holdco board of directors will
consist of a number of directors to be fixed from time to time by the Holdco
board of directors, and Holdco's certificate of incorporation provides that any
change in the size of the board of directors requires the vote of a majority of
the total number of authorized directors.

     Holdco's bylaws will separate the directors into three classes designated
Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist as nearly as may be
possible of one-third of the total directors constituting the entire board of
directors. Each director will serve for a three year term ending on the date of
the third annual meeting of stockholders next following the annual meeting at
which such director was elected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial
directors in Class I will serve until the first annual stockholder meeting, the
initial directors in Class II will serve until the second annual stockholder
meeting, and the initial directors in Class III will serve until the third
annual stockholder meeting.

     The Holdco bylaws will provide that directors are elected by a plurality of
the votes cast by Holdco stockholders entitled to vote in the election of
directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

     Holdco's certificate of incorporation will not provide for cumulative
voting.

VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     General.  Delaware law provides that if, at the time of the filling of any
vacancy or newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute
less than a majority of the authorized number of directors, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at
least 10% of the outstanding stock of the corporation having the right to vote
for such directors, order an election to be held to fill the vacancy or replace
the directors selected by the directors then in office.

     iXL.  Vacancies on the board of directors of iXL, including vacancies and
unfilled newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of the
directors then in office, though less than a quorum. Kelso and CB may nominate
for election individuals to fill any vacancy created by a director originally
nominated by Kelso or CB. iXL's bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of
Kelso and CB to approve the removal without cause of the directors nominated by
each for election, directors may be removed with or without cause by the
affirmative vote of the

holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of iXL
capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

     Scient.  Vacancies on the board of directors of Scient, including vacancies
and unfilled newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the

affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the total voting power of the
stock of Holdco, voting together as a single class.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     General.  Under Delaware law, an amendment to the certificate of

of directors and the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding stock
entitled to vote upon the proposed amendment, unless a higher vote is required
by the corporation's certificate of incorporation.

     iXL.  iXL's certificate of incorporation provides that its certificate of
incorporation may be amended according to the procedures described under
Delaware law. No amendment or repeal of the sections of the certificate
governing indemnification of officers, directors and employees and personal
liability of the directors of iXL may adversely affect any right or protection
existing immediately prior to the amendment or repeal.

     Scient.  Scient's certificate of incorporation provides that the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of

     - the nature of Scient's business; and

     - the capitalization of Scient.

     Additionally, Scient's certificate of incorporation requires the

shares of Scient capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors to
amend or repeal any other provision of the certificate of incorporation.

     Holdco.  Holdco's certificate of incorporation provides that the
certificate of incorporation may be amended according to the procedures
described under Delaware law. No amendment or repeal of the sections of the
certificate governing indemnification of officers and directors and the
liability of the directors of Holdco may adversely affect any right or
protection existing immediately prior to the amendment or repeal.

AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS

     General.  Under Delaware law, stockholders entitled to vote have the power
to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. In addition, a corporation may, in its
certificate of incorporation, confer this power on the board of directors. The
stockholders always have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws, even
though the board may also be delegated the power.

     iXL.  iXL's certificate of incorporation authorizes the iXL board of
directors to adopt, amend, alter or repeal any provision of iXL's bylaws. iXL's
bylaws provide that the bylaws may be amended, altered or

repealed by a majority of the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares
of iXL entitled to vote in the election of directors.

     Scient.  Scient's certificate of incorporation authorizes the Scient board
of directors to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind any or all of the bylaws
of Scient. The bylaws of Scient provide that notwithstanding the terms of the
certificate of incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
80% of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock, voting together as a
single class, is required for the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal any
provision of the bylaws or adopt any additional by-law.

     Holdco.  The Holdco certificate of incorporation will authorize the Holdco
board of directors to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Holdco bylaws. The
Holdco bylaws will provide that the bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed
by a majority vote of the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding share of
Holdco entitled to vote in the election of directors.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

     General.  Delaware law provides that, unless otherwise stated in the
certificate of incorporation, any action which may be taken at an annual meeting
or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, if a consent
in writing is signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having the minimum
number of votes necessary to authorize the action at a meeting of stockholders.

     iXL.  The iXL's certificate of incorporation prohibits stockholder action
by written consent.

     Scient.  Scient's certificate of incorporation prohibits stockholder action
by written consent.

     Holdco.  Holdco's certificate of incorporation will prohibit stockholder
action by written consent.

ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

     iXL.  Special meetings of iXL stockholders may be called by the chairman of
the board or the chief executive officer. Additionally the chief executive
officer or the secretary shall call a special meeting in the following

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     General.  Delaware law provides that a corporation may include in its
certificate of incorporation a provision limiting or eliminating the liability
of its directors to the corporation and its stockholders for monetary damages
arising from a breach of fiduciary duty, except for:

     - a breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

     - payment of a dividend or the repurchase or redemption of stock in
       violation of Delaware law; or

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

     iXL.  iXL's certificate of incorporation provides no director of iXL will
be liable to iXL or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption or limitation
is not permitted under Delaware law.

     Scient.  Scient's certificate of incorporation provides that a director
will not be personally liable to Scient or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:

     - for a breach of the duty of loyalty to Scient or its stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     General.  Under Delaware law, a corporation generally may indemnify
directors and officers:

     - for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed
       to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation; and

     - with respect to any criminal proceeding, they had no reasonable cause to
       believe that their conduct was unlawful.

     In addition, Delaware law provides that a corporation may advance to a
director or officer expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an
undertaking by the director or officer to repay the amount advanced if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

     iXL.  The iXL certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be a party to any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, because
that person is or was a director or officer, or is or was serving at the request
of iXL as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, will be indemnified and
held harmless by iXL to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. The
indemnification rights are contract rights, and iXL may not retroactively modify
any of the rights without the consent of the director or officer.

     In addition, iXL may pay expenses incurred by its directors and officers in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding because they are
directors or officers in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or
proceeding. The payment of expenses will be made only if iXL receives an
undertaking by or on behalf of a director or officer to repay all amounts
advanced if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified by iXL, as authorized by iXL's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

     The indemnification rights conferred by iXL are not exclusive of any other
right to which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any
statute, iXL's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. iXL is authorized to
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its directors and officers, or any
person serving at the request of iXL as director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     Scient.  Scient's bylaws provide for indemnification, to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law, of any person who is or was a director or officer of
Scient or who is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any
manner, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or officer of Scient, or is or was serving at the request of Scient
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
against all liability and cost suffered and expenses reasonably incurred by such
person.

     In addition, Scient's bylaws provide that the expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the person in defending any proceeding will be advanced to such person
by Scient provided that, to the extent required by law, the person undertakes to
repay the amounts advanced if ultimately it is determined that the person was
not entitled to be indemnified against the expenses.

     The indemnification rights conferred by Scient are not exclusive of any
other right which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any
statute, Scient's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

     Holdco.  Holdco's certificate of incorporation will provide for
indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, of any person
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director or officer of Holdco, or is or was serving at the request
of Holdco as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise. Additionally, by action of the board of
directors, Holdco may provide indemnification to officers, employees and agents
of Holdco. The right of indemnification is a contract right.

     In addition, Holdco's certificate of incorporation will provide that the
person being indemnified also has the right to be paid the expenses incurred in
connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the
fullest extent authorized by Delaware law.

     Holdco is authorized to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its
directors, officers, employees and agents of Holdco, or any person serving at
the request of Holdco as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     The indemnification rights conferred by Holdco are not exclusive of any
other right which persons seeking indemnification may otherwise have or may
acquire later.

STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLANS

     Scient.  On July 15, 2000, Scient's board authorized and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock
outstanding on such date. Each right represents the right to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock. The rights become exercisable if a
person or group acquires or announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the
common stock of Scient. Scient's board of directors is entitled to redeem the
rights at one cent per right at any time before any such person acquires 15% or
more of the outstanding common stock of Scient.

     If a person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock
of Scient, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at an initial
exercise price of $450.00, a number of shares of common stock having a market
value at that time of twice the right's exercise price. Rights held by the
acquiring person or group will become void. If Scient is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction after a person acquires 15% or more of
the Scient's common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at
the

right's then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company's common
shares having a market value at that time of twice the right's exercise price.

     In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Scient amended its
rights plan to make it inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and to provide that the rights plan will terminate immediately
prior to the consummation of the merger.

     Holdco.  Holdco does not intend to have a stockholders' rights plan.

STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES

     General.  Under the business combination statute of Delaware law, a
corporation is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with an
interested stockholder (who, together with its affiliates or associates, owns,
or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within a three-year
period did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock) for a three year
period following the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder,
unless:

     - prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the
       board of directors of the corporation approved either the business
       combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming
       an interested stockholder;

     - the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the
       corporation, excluding specified shares, upon consummation of the
       transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
       stockholder; or

     - at or subsequent to the time the stockholder became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination was approved by the board of
       directors of the corporation and authorized by the affirmative vote, at
       an annual or special meeting and not by written consent, of at least
       66 2/3% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, excluding
       shares held by that interested stockholder.

     A business combination generally includes:

     - mergers, consolidations and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of
       the assets of a corporation to or with an interested stockholder;

     - specified transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to an
       interested stockholder of any capital stock of the corporation or its
       subsidiaries; and

     - other transactions resulting in a disproportionate financial benefit to
       an interested stockholder.

     The provisions of the Delaware business combination statute do not apply to
a corporation if, subject to certain requirements, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the corporation contain a provision expressly
electing not to be governed by the provisions of the statute or the corporation
does not have voting stock listed on a national securities exchange, authorized
for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national
securities association or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders.

     iXL.  Because iXL has not adopted any provision in its certificate of
incorporation to "opt-out" of the Delaware business combination statute, the
statute is applicable to business combinations involving iXL.

     Scient.  Because Scient has not adopted any provision in its amended and
certificate of incorporation to "opt-out" of the Delaware business combination
statute, the statute is applicable to business combinations involving Scient.

     Holdco.  Because the Holdco certificate of incorporation will not include
any provision to "opt-out" of the Delaware business combination statute, the
statute will apply to business combinations involving Holdco.

                     MANAGEMENT OF HOLDCO AFTER THE MERGER

equity-based awards, such as stock options, is a highly effective way to align
the interests of employees, directors and consultants of Holdco with those of
the Holdco stockholders, and provides a cost-effective means of encouraging
their contributions to the success of Holdco.

     The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the issuance
of stock incentives to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a number
of shares of Holdco common stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of Holdco
common stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger, as
adjusted each subsequent January 1 to a number of shares not to exceed 25% of
the number of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding on such date. A large
portion of these options will be granted immediately following the merger in
order to provide important retention incentives for employees. For a description
of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, see the section entitled "The
Merger -- Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan" which begins on page
[               ] of this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

     The iXL board of directors has unanimously approved the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan and unanimously determined that the adoption of the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of iXL and its stockholders. The Holdco board of directors has also
unanimously approved the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan and unanimously
determined that the adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Holdco and its stockholders. The
iXL and Holdco boards of directors unanimously recommend that the stockholders
of iXL vote FOR the adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

     The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by iXL
stockholders is required to adopt the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

                             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholders may present
proper proposals for inclusion in a company's proxy statement and for
consideration at the next annual meeting of its stockholders by submitting their
proposals in a timely manner.

     iXL.  iXL has already held its 2001 annual meeting of stockholders. iXL
will hold an annual meeting in the year 2002 only if the merger has not already
been completed. Stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion
in the proxy materials for iXL's annual meeting of stockholders in 2002 may do
so by following the procedures prescribed in SEC Rule 14a-8. To be eligible for
inclusion, shareholder proposals must be received by our General Counsel no
later than December 30, 2001. Notice of a shareholder proposal submitted outside
the procedures of Rule 14a-8 will be considered untimely unless submitted by
January 29, 2002. If a proposal is not submitted by that date, the persons named
in our proxy for the 2002 annual meeting will be allowed to exercise their
discretionary authority to vote upon any such proposal without the matter having
been discussed in the proxy statement for the 2002 annual meeting. All notices
of proposals by

stockholders, whether or not to be included in iXL's proxy materials, should be
sent to the attention of the Secretary of iXL at 1600 Peachtree Street, Atlanta,
GA 30309.

     Scient.  Scient held its 2001 annual meeting on August 24, 2001. Scient
will hold its 2002 annual meeting only if the merger has not already been
completed. If the 2002 annual meeting is held, stockholder proposals intended to
be presented at the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by
Scient at its offices at 860 Broadway, New York, New York 10003, Attn:
Secretary, not later than March 30, 2002 and satisfy the conditions established
by the Securities and Exchange Commission for stockholder proposals to be
included in Scient's proxy statement for that meeting. Pursuant to new
amendments to Rule 14a-4(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
if a stockholder who intends to present a proposal at the 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders does not notify Scient of such proposal on or prior to May 18,
2002, then management proxies would be allowed to use their discretionary voting
authority to vote on the proposal when the proposal is raised at the annual
meeting, even though there is no discussion of the proposal in the 2002 Proxy
Statement. Scient currently believes that the 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders will be held during the third week of August 2002.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
iXL Enterprises, Inc.:

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of iXL Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows
from operations since its inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to
these matters, which include the Company's proposed merger with Scient
Corporation, are also described in Note 2. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     iXL Enterprises, Inc. is a leading business and technology consultancy that
helps companies utilize the power of emerging technologies and advanced business
strategies to build stronger, more profitable relationships with their customers
and business partners. iXL has 12 offices in the United States and Europe. The
Company helps businesses identify how the Internet can be used to their
competitive advantage and provides expertise in creative design and systems
engineering to design, develop and deploy advanced Internet applications and
solutions.

  Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company accounts for its investments
in ProAct Technologies Corp., Digital Planet and AppGenesys, Inc. under the
equity method of accounting.

     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company's voting interest in ProAct,
formerly Consumer Financial Network, Inc., was reduced to less than 50% as the
result of ProAct's issuance of additional common stock and mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, in the second quarter of
2000, the Company deconsolidated ProAct. The Company has presented its results
of operations and financial condition as if the deconsolidation occurred on
January 1, 2000. For additional information about the Company's interest in
ProAct, see Note 3.

     During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company's voting interest in Digital
Planet, formerly iXL Live, was reduced to less than 50% as the result of Digital
Planet's issuance of additional mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.
Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company deconsolidated Digital
Planet. The Company has presented its results of operations and financial
condition as if the deconsolidation occurred on January 1, 2000.

     Certain items in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.

  Revenue Recognition

     Revenue is recognized for fixed fee contracts using the percentage of
completion method based on costs incurred. Revenue is recognized as services are
performed for time and material contracts. Revenue is recognized in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements."

     Unbilled revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in advance of
billings. Such amounts are normally converted into accounts receivable within 90
days. Deferred revenue represents billings made or cash received in advance of
services performed or costs incurred under contracts. Any anticipated losses on
contracts are charged to earnings when identified. Revenue from post-contract
support is recorded as services are provided.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

                                       F-7

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Marketable Securities

     Marketable securities include the Company's investments classified as
available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity. Marketable securities also include short-term investments
with original maturities in excess of three months.

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the
productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Depreciation expense is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives for purchased assets. Equipment held under capital leases
is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life
or the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease.

  Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets consist primarily of assembled workforce and excess of
cost over fair value of net assets acquired, referred to as goodwill, and are
stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Identifiable intangible assets
consist primarily of assembled workforce, which is being amortized over its
estimated future life of three years. Goodwill is being amortized over its
estimated future life of five years.

  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of," the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived
assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or
circumstances, both internally and externally, that may suggest impairment. If
such circumstances exist, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived
assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted
expected future cash flows or other fair market value determinations. See Notes
4 and 5 for further discussion.

  Advertising Costs

     The Company expenses production costs of advertising the first time the
advertising takes place. Advertising expenses were $1,584, $9,927, and $1,396
for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

  Income Taxes

     The Company has applied the asset and liability approach of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," for financial accounting and reporting purposes.
The Company accounts for certain items of income and expense in different time
periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred
income taxes are made in recognition of such temporary differences, where
applicable. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets
unless the Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit will be
realized.

  Stock-Based Compensation Plans

     The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" and related
                                       F-8

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Interpretations and elects the disclosure option of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation." Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options
is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Company's stock at
the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
The Company also records stock compensation expense for any options issued to
non-employees using the fair value method prescribed in SFAS 123.

  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share

     Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. No potential common shares
have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculated as they would
have been antidilutive due to the net loss reported by the Company. The
convertible securities outstanding and the number of common shares into which
they are convertible are as follows:

     Net loss available to common stockholders used in calculating basic and
diluted earnings per share includes charges related to dividends and accretion
on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock of subsidiary.

  Foreign Currency Translation

     The financial position and results of operations of foreign subsidiaries
are measured using the currency of the respective countries as the functional
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency
(U.S. dollars) at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date,
while revenue and expenses for the period are translated at the average exchange
rate in effect during the period. Translation gains and losses are accumulated
and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The Company has
not entered into any hedging contracts during any of the periods presented.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, approximate fair value. The carrying amount of capital lease
obligations approximates fair value based on current rates of interest available
to the Company for leases of similar maturities. We are required to make
adjustments to the carrying value of our note payable to ProAct as well as
certain call rights granted to ProAct, both of which are included in long-term
debt. See Note 10 for further discussion.

  Comprehensive Income

     SFAS No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income" requires that the total
changes in equity resulting from revenue, expenses, and gains and losses,
including those that do not affect the accumulated deficit, be reported.
Accordingly, those amounts, comprised of foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities, are
included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and
assumptions used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based
upon management's evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the
date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company relied on estimates in its calculation of restructuring
charges and the impairment charge on intangible assets. See further discussion
in Notes 4 and 5.

  New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. Adoption of SFAS 133, as amended by FAS 138, is required for
the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2001. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
133 to have a material impact on our financial statements.

     In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a
Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." This statement revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral. This statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial
assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS 140 to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

2. LIQUIDITY

     The Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations
since its inception. iXL's future liquidity and capital requirements will depend
on many factors. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased
to $52.6 million at December 31, 2000 from $155.7 million at December 31, 1999,
of which $15.2 million related to ProAct. Our cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities decreased to $25.8 million at June 30, 2001. At the time
of filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believed that our existing cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with funds available
under the credit facility, and proceeds from our recent stock sales (see Note
22) in March would be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working
capital and capital expenditures for the remainder of 2001.

     Subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K, we have experienced additional
declines in revenue resulting in continued operating losses and we violated an
amended debt covenant as of June 30, 2001 (See Note 22). The Company and Scient
have entered into a definitive agreement to merge. Shareholders of approximately
34% of the outstanding common stock of iXL and shareholders of approximately 34%
of the outstanding common stock of Scient have agreed to vote their shares in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. However, there can be no
assurance that the merger will be successfully completed as it is subject to
shareholder approval by the shareholders of each of the Company and Scient
respectively.

     We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities and cash from operations, together with funds that may be available
under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for
working capital and capital expenditures until the earlier of the consummation
of the pending merger or November 30, 2001. In the event the merger does not
close by November 30, 2001, the Company would be in violation of certain debt
covenants or be required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit under
the credit facility with cash and, among other things, would not have access to
funds under the credit facility. As a result, we would require additional funds
or liquidity to fund our operations or further

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

reduce our workforce, or both. We are also continuing our efforts to raise
additional funds through the sale of certain minority equity interests in
developing businesses held by iXL Ventures. There can be no assurance any such
assets can be sold on acceptable terms or for cash. If we raise additional funds
through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities, such equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of common
stock. Furthermore, because of the low trading price of iXL's common stock, the
number of shares of the new equity or equity-related securities that may be
required to be issued may cause stockholders to experience significant
additional dilution. In addition, the issuance of debt securities could increase
the risk or perceived risk of iXL. We cannot, however, be certain that
additional financing, or funds from asset sales, will be available on acceptable
terms if required. If this additional financing becomes necessary and is not
available or we are unable to raise funds from the sale of assets or our pending
merger with Scient does not close in the time period anticipated, we may need to
dramatically change our business plan or face bankruptcy or liquidation. The
matters discussed above raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern if the merger is not completed. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

3. DECONSOLIDATION OF PROACT TECHNOLOGIES CORP.

     During 1998 and 1999, the Company consolidated the operating results, cash
flows and financial position of ProAct Technologies Corp., formerly known as
Consumer Financial Network, Inc. On March 22, 2000, ProAct sold 32,896,000
shares of its mandatorily redeemable series C convertible preferred stock for
net proceeds of approximately $127,084. During the second quarter of 2000,
ProAct completed three acquisitions for cash and shares of its common stock
totaling approximately $111,000. On June 30, 2000, ProAct sold 25,000,000 shares
of mandatorily redeemable series D convertible preferred stock for net proceeds
of approximately $148,000. As a result of these transactions, the Company's
ownership of ProAct was reduced to approximately 49% of the voting interest and
85% of ProAct's outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 no longer
include the consolidated financial statements of ProAct as a consolidated
subsidiary, and the Company instead has accounted for its ownership using the
equity method of accounting. The above transactions resulted in the Company
recording an increase in its stockholders' equity of approximately $62,800 in
accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51. During the three
months ended June 30, 2000, ProAct recorded approximately $1,700 of stock
compensation expense for the acceleration of the Company's stock options. At
December 31, 2000, the Company's investment in ProAct was zero as a result of
recording its share of ProAct's losses using the equity method of accounting.
Unaudited summary financial information for ProAct is included in Note 10.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     In September 2000, the Company announced a major restructuring of its
business operations. The restructuring plan was designed to reduce costs and
improve efficiency, and as a result, the Company reduced its workforce by
approximately 350 employees. In November 2000, the Company announced plans for
additional restructuring which included the closing or sale of several offices
and a reduction in workforce by approximately 850 additional employees. Of these
total reductions in workforce approximately 800 were professional services
personnel, 300 were general and administrative personnel, and 100 were in sales
and marketing personnel. The restructuring was an effort to become a more
industry-focused company and to deliver a higher level of quality and depth of
expertise for our clients. As a result of this restructuring, the Company
recorded a charge of $76,588. Included in this total are $38,463 of costs
related to rent and sublease expenses net of anticipated sublease income for
abandoned office leases, $27,299 million resulting from the write-down leasehold
improvements and equipment that were impaired as a result of the closure of
offices and a decrease in demand for the Company's services and resulting
decrease in revenue, and $10,826 million in severance due to the reduction in
workforce.

     The Company expects future cash expenditures related to these restructuring
activities to be approximately $41,625, of which $30,328 is anticipated to be
paid within the next twelve months. The Company recorded an impairment charge in
conjunction with its restructuring charges. The impairment charge is discussed
in further detail in Note 5.

5. IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     As a result of a sustained drop in the market capitalization of the Company
and the changes in the dynamics of the demand for Internet consulting services,
during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company evaluated the recoverability of
its intangible assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The Company
reviewed the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by its operations.
These cash flows were below the carrying value of the goodwill recorded as a
result of the Company's acquisitions. Therefore the Company adjusted the
carrying value of the goodwill and acquired workforce and recorded an impairment
charge of $97,402. Of the total impairment charge taken, $74,047 was a
write-down of assets recorded as a result of the Tessera acquisition.

     These intangible assets resulted from the Company's acquisitions. These
acquisitions are discussed further in Note 6.

     On January 11, 2000, the Company acquired Tessera Enterprise Systems, Inc.
in exchange for $3,700 and 3,588,655 shares of the Company's common stock. The
Company recorded an aggregate purchase price of approximately $132,846. The
purchase price in excess of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed of approximately $116,535 was allocated to goodwill and
is being amortized over an estimated useful life of five years. Approximately
$6,136 of the aggregate purchase price was allocated to assembled workforce and
is being amortized over an estimated useful life of three years.

     All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method, and
accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of
their fair value on the acquisition dates. The historical carrying amounts of
tangible net assets acquired approximated their fair values. The fair value of
identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on independent appraisals or
management estimates. Since the date of acquisition, the results of operations
of the acquired companies have been included in the consolidated statements of
operations.

     The Company amortizes goodwill over its estimated useful life of primarily
five years and assembled workforce over its estimated useful life of three
years. However, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its intangible
assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." As a part of this
evaluation, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $97,402 as further
discussed in Note 5.

7. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

     Marketable securities include short-term investments, such as United States
government agency obligations and commercial paper, with original maturities in
excess of three months. These short-term investments at December 31, 1999 and
2000 were $22,507 and $3,508, respectively. The fair value of these investments
is not materially different from their carrying value. Interest and amortization
of premiums and discounts for these short-term investments are included in
interest income.

     Marketable securities also include available-for-sale securities, which are
recorded at fair market value. These available-for-sale securities represent our
investment in the common stock of affiliated companies that are publicly traded,
including principally Student Advantage, Inc. We calculated the market value for
these securities based on their quoted sales prices at December 31, 1999 and
2000. The difference between amortized cost and fair market value is included in
other comprehensive income and shown as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.

     The following tables summarize the Company's available-for-sale securities:

10. EQUITY IN NET LOSSES OF AFFILIATES

     During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company accounted for its
investment in Student Advantage, Inc. using the equity method. Our investment in
Student Advantage had a book value of $0 at December 31, 1998. When the
Company's ownership interest in Student Advantage fell below 20% in June 1999,
we began accounting for our investment using the cost method and classified our

566,311 shares of Student Advantage common stock for an aggregate sales price of
$1,926.

     During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company accounted for its

  Credit Facility

     On January 7, 2000, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving
syndicated credit facility with several institutions providing for borrowings of
up to $50,000. The credit facility expires on January 7, 2002. The credit
facility bears interest payable at least quarterly at a rate of either (i) 2.75%
plus an adjusted LIBOR rate or (ii) 1.75% plus the greater of Chase Manhattan
Bank's prime rate or .5% plus the federal funds rate. The credit facility is
secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of our domestic operating
subsidiaries, excluding iXL Ventures. These obligations are also secured by all
of the capital stock of iXL's domestic operating subsidiaries, iXL's stock
holdings in ProAct, the general and limited partnership interests in iXL
Ventures LP, and 65% of the capital stock of iXL's foreign subsidiaries,
including the pledge of the capital stock of the same subsidiary companies. The
credit facility provided for borrowings based upon a borrowing base formula of
qualified billed and unbilled accounts receivable. A commitment fee is charged
on the unused portion of the credit facility.

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     On December 7, 2000, the Company executed an amendment to the credit
facility to waive a violation of a financial covenant. The credit facility was
further amended to: restrict the borrowing base to qualified billed accounts
receivable from domestic operations; permit the sale by the Company of equity
interests forming part of the collateral securing iXL's obligations associated
with the credit facility; reduce the amount of permitted capital expenditures;
reduce the minimum required consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization); and require the Company to
maintain a minimum level of liquidity.

     Because of reductions in the available borrowing base, there were no
borrowings available under the credit facility as of December 31, 2000. We also
had a restricted cash balance of approximately $4,700. The Company had utilized
approximately $24,700 of the credit facility for letters of credit issued
primarily as security for office leases as of December 31, 2000. Of the letters
of credit utilized as of December 31, 2000, approximately $21,100 pertain to
properties that we have abandoned but for which we still have a contractual
obligation.

  Note Payable to Proact

     On December 19, 2000 the Company consummated a transaction with ProAct in
which iXL Ventures PHC, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, issued a 5.75% secured convertible note to ProAct in exchange for a
cash payment of $20,000. The note is secured by and exchangeable for, upon
satisfaction of certain conditions, 10 million shares of common stock of ProAct
held by iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. has no other properties or
assets other than its interest in the ProAct common stock. The note is
non-recourse to iXL Enterprises, Inc.

     The note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis
commencing March 31, 2001. The entire amount of unpaid principal and accrued and
unpaid interest is due and payable on January 7, 2004. The Company may at any
time prepay all or a portion of the principal amount. The Company may repay the
principal amount of the note by payment in cash or by transfer of the pledged
collateral. Also, ProAct, at its option, may at any time (1) exchange the note
for the pledged collateral or (2) purchase the pledged collateral for $20,000.
We are required to make adjustments to the carrying value of the note for
changes in the fair value of ProAct's common stock because the terms of the note
enable ProAct to exchange the note for the pledged collateral. We will record
any resulting adjustment as interest income or interest expense.

     Additionally, in conjunction with the issuance of the secured convertible
note, the Company issued to ProAct call rights to purchase up to 10 million
shares of its common stock owned by iXL Ventures LP at a purchase price of $3.00
per share. ProAct may exercise the call rights at any time for all or a portion
of the call shares provided that the minimum amount of call shares purchased at
any time is 500,000. The call rights expire on January 7, 2004.

     The Company allocated the proceeds received from the debt issuance between
the note and the call rights based on their relative fair market values at the
date of issuance. The portion allocated to the call rights resulted in a
corresponding discount on the note and will be recognized as additional interest
expense over the term of the note. As a result, the effective rate of interest
on the note was approximately 20% at December 31, 2000. The note is recorded in
long-term debt at its discounted value plus accrued interest, together with the
call rights that are recorded at their fair value. We are required to reflect
the call rights at their fair value while they are outstanding with any
resulting changes in the fair value being recorded as income or expense. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
of the call rights.

12. AGREEMENT WITH HPS AMERICA, INC.

     On December 28, 2000, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement
with HPS under which HPS purchased one million shares of the Company's common
stock at $3.00 per share. HPS paid $1,500 upon execution of the agreement. The
remaining $1,500 is due on August 31, 2001 and was recorded as subscription

                                       F-17

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

receivable in stockholders' equity. The Company agreed to subcontract $65,000 of
services to HPS over a three-year period. Services that will be subcontracted to
HPS include application software development, migration, re-engineering, systems
integration, service management and other professional services. The $65,000
commitment is required to be met as follows: $5,000 in the first six months;
$10,000 in the second six months; $20,000 in the second year; and $30,000 in the
third year. If the Company fails to meet these commitments, the Company must pay
HPS the difference between the commitment and the value of the business actually
given during the applicable period. Likewise, in any future periods, excess
business over the defined commitment is applied against shortfalls in prior
periods and returned to the Company. If the requirement for the first six months
is not met, HPS can apply the remaining the $1,500 due on the common stock
purchase against any shortfall.

13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company issued 8,031 shares of
class A preferred stock for approximately $5,510, including a $900 note
receivable.

     In January 1999, the Company issued 22,825 shares of class A preferred
stock for approximately $22,718. A portion of the proceeds from the sale was
used to repay approximately $9,430 of borrowings outstanding under the revolving
line of credit portion of our credit facility.

     On June 8, 1999, the Company completed its initial public offering and
received net proceeds of approximately $61,700 from the sale of 6,000,000 shares
of common stock. Also, on June 8, 1999, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of
common stock for $23,500 in a private placement. On June 14, 1999, the
underwriters exercised their over-allotment option resulting in the sale of
900,000 additional shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately
$10,000.

     Upon the closing of the Company's initial public offering, all outstanding
shares of (i) class A, class B and class C convertible preferred stock and class
D non-voting preferred stock and (ii) class A and class B common stock were
reclassified as common stock. This reclassification precluded the automatic
conversion feature of the class A, class B and class C convertible preferred
stock.

     As a result of the reclassification, the class D preferred stockholders
received in the aggregate (i) 3,722,502 shares of common stock plus (ii) a
number of shares equal to the class D preferred stock liquidation value of
$35,700 plus accrued dividends divided by the gross initial public offering
price of common stock before deducting any underwriting or other selling
accounts, or 3,264,115 shares.

     On November 24, 1999, the Company completed a secondary public offering and
received net proceeds of approximately $68,600 from the sale of 2,000,000 shares
of common stock. On December 14, 1999, the underwriters exercised their
over-allotment option resulting in the sale of 50,000 additional shares of
common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1,800.

     On December 28, 2000, the Company issued shares to HPS as discussed in Note
12.

     As of December 31, 1999 and 2000, the Company's capital stock consisted of
$.01 par value common stock and $.01 par value class A preferred stock. The
Company had 5,000,000 authorized class A preferred shares at December 31, 1999
and 2000. No preferred shares were outstanding at either date.

  Warrants

     In November 1998, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of
common stock at $10 per share. The fair value of the warrants, which were
immediately exercisable at the grant date, was measured on the date the warrants
were earned and was recorded as an expense of approximately $815 in the fourth
quarter of 1998. We calculated the fair value of these warrants using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

                                       F-18

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

following assumptions: dividend yield 0%, risk-free interest rate 5.0%, expected
volatility 72% and expected life of three years. The warrants expire three years
from the date of grant.

     In December 1998, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of
common stock at $10 per share. The warrants, which were immediately exercisable
at the grant date, were issued in conjunction with a services contract. The
related charge, based on the fair value of the warrants, was recorded as
reduction of revenue as we provided the services. Accordingly, we reduced
services revenue by $1,050 and $150 during 1999 and 2000, respectively. We
calculated the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield 0%, risk free
interest rate 5.0%, expected volatility 82% and expected life of 18 months. The
warrants were exercised during the second quarter of 2000. Instead of paying
cash to us, the holder exchanged all 500,000 warrants for 206,959 shares of
common stock. The number of shares issued at the exercise date was based on the
fair market value of our common stock on that date.

     As more fully described in Note 21, in 1999 the Company granted warrants to
purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock to a related party.

  Treasury Stock

     During February and March 1998, the Company purchased a total of 242,416
shares of class B common stock from two employees at a purchase price of $3.25
per share. During September 1998, the Company purchased a total of 10,000 shares
of class B common stock from an employee at a price of $10 per share. During
November 1999, the Company converted 100,000 shares of common stock held in
escrow into treasury stock.

14. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

     Prior to the Company's initial public offering, a total of 265,000 shares
of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock had been designated for
issuance; 200,000, 15,000 and 50,000 of such shares had been designated as class
B, class C and class D convertible preferred stock, respectively.

     Prior to the closing of the Company's initial public offering, the
Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's certificate of
incorporation, which took effect upon such closing. Pursuant to such amendment,
upon the closing of the initial public offering, all outstanding shares were
reclassified as common stock.

     In December 1997, for net consideration of approximately $26,900 and
$2,990, the Company issued 83,075 shares of class B preferred, par value $.01
and 9,232 shares of class C preferred, par value $.01. In conjunction with this
equity transaction, the Company issued warrants to purchase 10,650 shares of
class B preferred for $458 per share. In February 1998, for net consideration of
approximately $4,935, the Company issued 15,692 shares of class B preferred and
warrants to purchase 1,810 shares of class B preferred for $458 per share. In
August 1998, for net consideration of approximately $35,400, the Company issued
35,700 shares of class D preferred, $.01 par value. The Company accounted for
the class B, class C and class D preferred as mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock. Accordingly, the Company accrued dividends and amortized any difference
between the carrying value and the redemption value over the projected
redemption period with a charge to additional paid-in capital, or APIC. The
amount charged to APIC related to the class B and class C preferred was $5,449
and $926, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1998. The amount charged
to APIC related to the class B and class C preferred was $5,160 and $482,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1999.

     The class D preferred provided that, upon redemption the holders would
receive $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends and a certain
number of shares of class B common stock of the Company. The aggregate number of
shares of class B common stock to be issued varied based on the timing of an
initial
                                       F-19

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

public offering of the Company's common stock with a per share price of at least
$7 and for which the aggregate proceeds to the Company equal at least $30,000 (a
"Qualified Public Offering"). At a minimum, the number of class B common stock
shares to be issued would equal 3,722,502 shares. The proceeds from the issuance
of the class D preferred were allocated to the class D preferred (included in
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock) and class B common stock to be issued
(included in additional paid-in-capital), based on the relative fair values of
the securities as of the date of issuance. Of the approximately $35,400 total
proceeds from the issuance of the class D preferred, $22,165 was allocated to
the class D preferred and the remaining $13,235 was allocated to class B common
stock to be issued. The amount allocated to the class B common stock to be
issued was based on the fair value of the guaranteed minimum number of shares
(3,722,502) to be issued. The number of shares of class B common stock to be
issued could potentially increase up to a maximum of 5,279,293 shares, depending
on the timing of a Qualified Public Offering. The fair value of the additional
1,556,791 potentially issuable shares of class B common stock was determined at
the end of each reporting period was ratably charged to net loss available to
common stockholders, over the projected 7-year redemption period. Through the
date of the closing of the initial public offering, the Company accrued the 12%
dividend on the class D preferred and accreted any difference between the
carrying value and the redemption value over the projected 7-year redemption
period with a charge to APIC.

     Upon the closing of the Company's initial public offering in June 1999, the
class D preferred stockholders received in the aggregate 3,722,502 shares of
common stock plus a number of shares equal to the class D preferred Stock
liquidation value of $35,700 plus accrued dividends divided by the gross initial
public offering price of common stock before deducting any underwriting or other
selling discounts or 3,264,115 shares. This transaction resulted in a charge to
net loss available to common shareholders equal to the difference between
$35,700 plus accrued dividends and the carrying value of the class D preferred.
The amount of this charge was $12,341.

15. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF A SUBSIDIARY

     In November 1998, ProAct sold 13,333,334 shares of the mandatorily
redeemable ProAct series A convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of
$9,839. As more fully described in the Note 21, in April 1999, the Company and
ProAct entered into several agreements with a related party. In one of the
agreements, the related party purchased 16,190,475 shares of the mandatorily
redeemable ProAct Series B convertible preferred stock with a face value of
$50,000. Warrants to purchase iXL common stock were issued to the related party
in conjunction with these agreements. We calculated the fair value of the
warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and $11,200 of the value
of these warrants was allocated to the purchase of the mandatorily redeemable
ProAct Series B convertible preferred stock. As such, we recorded this $11,200
as a reduction of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary and an
increase in APIC. This amount was being accreted ratably over the redemption
period to increase the carrying value of the mandatorily redeemable ProAct
series B convertible preferred stock to its redemption value of $50,000. ProAct
received net proceeds of approximately $49,300 from the sale of the mandatorily
redeemable ProAct series B convertible preferred. Stock. The amount charged to
APIC related to the accretion of the mandatorily redeemable ProAct series B
convertible preferred stock was $1,054 for the year ended December 31, 1999.

16. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     The Company has three stock option plans and an employee stock purchase
plan. In general, we can issue stock options to officers, employees or
non-employees with the approval of our board of directors. We expect that most
options granted pursuant to the plans will be subject to vesting over a period
of four to five years, such as 25% increments each year over a period of four
years, during which time the option holder must continue to be an employee of
the Company. We may choose, however, to impose different vesting requirements or
none at all. Options outstanding under the stock option plans generally have a
term of ten

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

years. The stock options plans authorize the granting of up to an aggregate
maximum of 37,094,353 of which 31,122,215 were outstanding at December 31, 2000.

     In connection with the acquisition of Tessera during January 2000, the
Company assumed its stock option plan. The options outstanding under the Tessera
plan and their exercise prices were converted to options to purchase iXL common
stock using a ratio equal to that used to convert common shares exchanged in the
business combination. We granted a total of 634,392 options, as converted, at
the date of acquisition, of which 213,859 were outstanding as of December 31,
2000. No further options can be issued under the Tessera Plan.

     In February 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under this plan, we are authorized to issue up to
an aggregate maximum of 1,500,000 shares of common stock to domestic employees,
nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. Subject to certain limitations,
employees can elect every three months to have from two to ten percent of their
salary and bonus withheld to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase
price of our common stock under the plan is 85 percent of the lower of its
beginning-of-period or end-of-period market price. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, we sold 375,674 shares of common stock through the stock
purchase plan. As of December 31, 2000, we had available 1,124,326 shares for
issuance under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

     The Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
the stock option plans and the stock purchase plan. During the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, we recognized compensation expense of $1,641,
$4,920 and $4,138, respectively for stock options issued to employees and
non-employees. Stock options issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions
were accounted for as additional purchase price for the acquired businesses.

     If we had determined compensation expense for the Company's stock option
plans and employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of FAS 123 based on
the fair value at the grant date, the Company's net loss and loss per share
would have been increased to the pro forma amounts shown below:

                                                         FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

     We estimated the fair value of the options granted under the stock option
plans on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants during the 1998, 1999 and
2000 periods, respectively: dividend yield of 0% for all periods; expected
volatility of 0%, 85% and 125%; risk free interest rate of 5.0%, 5.75% and
5.88%; expected life of four years for all periods. We used the same
weighted-average assumptions for the look-back options granted under the
employee stock purchase plan during the 2000 period except that we used a risk
free interest rate of 6.12% and an expected life of three months.

17. INCOME TAXES

     In 2000, we made a current provision for state income taxes of $600
relating to the operations of Tessera in Massachusetts. We did not record income
taxes in 1998 or 1999.

     Actual income taxes differ from the expected income tax benefit calculated
by applying the federal statutory rate of 34% to our loss before income taxes as
follows:

     As of December 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
for federal income tax purposes of approximately $205,000, including foreign
losses of approximately $26,000. Of the Company's net operating loss
carryforwards, $66,000 relates to tax deductions from exercised stock options
and warrants, which will be tax-effected and reflected as additional
paid-in-capital when realized. The Company's net operating loss carryforwards
expire in varying amounts between 2011 and 2020.

     In addition, the amounts of, and the benefits from, net operating loss
carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. The Company
experienced ownership changes as defined under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. As a result of the ownership changes, net operating loss
carryforwards for the Company, which were incurred prior to the date of change,
are subject to annual limitations on their future use. As of December 31, 2000,
a valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets we do
not believe are more likely than not to be realized.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Due to the deconsolidation of ProAct in 2000, as discussed in Note 3, the
Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities have been adjusted to remove the
cumulative effect of ProAct's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
The Company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2000 include a temporary
difference for its equity investment in ProAct.

18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     Employees of the Company can elect to participate in the iXL Enterprises,
Inc. Savings Plan which is intended to be qualified and exempt from tax under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees are eligible to
participate in the 401(k) plan after one month of service and can elect to
invest 1% to 16% of their pre-tax earnings. All employee contributions are fully
vested. The Company is not required, but may at its discretion make
contributions to the 401(k) plan. In 2000, the Company contributed $1,800 to the
401(k) plan for the 1999 plan year. The Company has not made any other
discretionary contributions.

19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Operating Leases

     The Company leases certain operating facilities and equipment under
non-cancelable agreements expiring through 2015, some of which require us to pay
operating costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. These
facility leases generally contain renewal options and some contain escalation
provisions that increase the lease payments in future periods. We record rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

     As of December 31, 2000, the approximate future minimum lease payments for
noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

2001........................................................  $ 28,327
2002........................................................    28,446
2003........................................................    28,167
2004........................................................    26,872
2005........................................................    24,245
Thereafter..................................................   129,322

                                                              ========

     Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced for future minimum
sublease rentals aggregating approximately $14,857. Operating lease expense
charged to operations was approximately $3,844 in 1998, $8,125 in 1999, and
$18,499 in 2000 net of sublease rental income of approximately $2,552 in 2000.
Sublease income was not material in 1998 and 1999.

     Many of the payments detailed above pertain to offices that we have
shutdown or significantly reduced in size in conjunction with our restructuring
plan. This plan is discussed further in Note 4.

  Legal Proceedings

     On or about September 8, 2000, the first in a series of shareholder class
action complaints was filed against iXL and certain of its present and former
directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. Those cases were consolidated by Order dated January 23,
2001, and a consolidated amended class action complaint (Case No.
1:00-CV-2347-CC) was filed on March 27, 2001, naming only iXL as a defendant, on
behalf of a putative class of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired
securities of iXL between November 30, 1999 and September 1, 2000. The amended
complaint seeks damages based on allegedly false and misleading press releases
and SEC filings concerning our business prospects and revenue recognition. The
amended complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) of the

complaint alleges causes of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, the Georgia Blue Sky laws, as well as common law claims for breach of
contract and negligent misrepresentation arising out of a merger agreement. We
have filed motions to dismiss the Redwing complaint. We intend to move to
dismiss the class action amended complaint. We believe we have meritorious
defenses to the allegations and intend to defend these cases vigorously.

20. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     In 1999, the Company operated in two business segments: strategic Internet
services, which includes Internet strategy consulting, Internet-based business
solutions and solution sets; and ProAct, an e-commerce and software application
company, which markets financial services and employee benefits over corporate
intranets and the Internet, as well as through telesales. In the second quarter
of 2000, the Company deconsolidated ProAct as further discussed in Note 3.
Accordingly, we have only one business segment in 2000.

     Information concerning the operations in these reportable segments is as
follows:

21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     In January 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to lease office
space for eleven years from an entity in which our chairman is a limited
partner. The Company made rent payments of $628 in 1998, $1,602 in 1999 and
$1,115 in 2000 under this office lease agreement.

     In June 1998, the chairman's spouse loaned the Company $4,000 at an
interest rate of 10%. The principal and interest on this note were repaid in
July 1998.

     The Company has agreed to pay one of its investors an annual fee of $15 for
financial advisory services. The investor is indemnified against certain claims,
losses, damages, liabilities and expenses that may arise in connection with
rendering such financial advisory services. During 1999, the Company paid the
investor 62,500 shares of common stock valued at $750 in connection with
services provided to the Company during its initial public offering.

     The Company recognized revenue in 1998, 1999 and 2000 from providing
services to some of its investors, and entities related to its investors, of
$2,177, and $30,005 and $31,644, respectively.

     A member of the Company's board of directors was also the chief executive
office of one of our customers through 2000. In 1998, 1999 and 2000 the Company
recognized revenue of approximately $5,540, $3,311 and $1,177, respectively,
from this customer or its predecessor companies.

     As of December 31, 2000, amounts due from a single related party comprised
approximately $4,501 or 9% of accounts receivable. Amounts relating to contracts
with the same related party comprised approximately $707 or 5% of unbilled
revenue as of December 31, 2000.

     In April 1999, the Company entered into several agreements with affiliates
of a related party whereby:

          (1) the related party purchased 16,190,475 shares of ProAct series B
     mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, which at that time
     represented 12.5% of ProAct, on an as-converted basis, for a purchase price
     of approximately $50,000;

          (2) the related party entered into an agreement to purchase $20,000 of
     services from the Company and in exchange for entering into such agreement
     the Company would grant the related party warrants to purchase 1,000,000
     shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $15 per share;

          (3) the related party purchased 2,000,000 shares of the Company's
     common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering
     price in a private placement that was concurrent with the initial public
     offering; and

          (4) the Company granted to the related party warrants to purchase
     1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal
     to the initial public offering price in consideration for the related party
     (a) implementing a mutually acceptable marketing campaign to advertise its
     relationships with the Company and ProAct, and (b) entering into an
     agreement to use reasonable efforts to provide access to ProAct's platform
     to employees of its affiliate.

     All the warrants issued in connection with the April 1999 transactions
referred to above were 100% vested on the date of grant, nonforfeitable and are
exercisable after one year subsequent to the date of grant. The fair value of
the warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock issued in connection
with the $20,000 service agreement was $4,800. During 1999, the related charges
were recorded as a reduction of revenue as the services were provided. We
calculated the fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions: dividend yield 0%; expected volatility
85%; risk free interest rate 5%; life of warrants is three years; fair market
value of underlying iXL common stock on date of grant was $10.00.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The fair value of the warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock
was $12,600. We calculated the fair value of the warrants using the Black
Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield 0%;
expected volatility 85%; risk free interest rate 5%; life of warrant is five
years; fair market value of underlying iXL common stock on date of grant was
$12.00 (based on the initial public offering price); exercise price of warrants
was $12.00.

     The fair value of these warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the
Company's common stock was allocated and recorded as follows:

     - $200 to the agreement to provide access to ProAct's platform to employees
       of its affiliate. Such amount was recorded as expense in 1999.

     - $1,200 to the agreement to provide marketing services to iXL and ProAct.
       Such amount was expensed as the marketing services were received. The
       amount charged to expense during 1999 and 2000 was $820 and $380,
       respectively.

     - the remaining $11,200 of value of the warrants was recorded as a
       reduction of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary and an
       increase in additional paid-in capital. This amount was being accreted
       ratably over the redemption period to increase the carrying value of the
       ProAct series B convertible preferred stock to its redemption value of
       $50,000. We obtained an independent valuation of the ProAct business for
       the purpose of allocating the value of the warrants to the investment in
       ProAct.

     The Company recorded revenue of approximately $1,138 from service
agreements with an affiliated company. In addition, the affiliated company paid
us approximately $1,246 for rent, management fees and other administrative
charges. The Company recorded the management fees in other income, while the
payments for rent and other administrative charges were recorded as a reduction
of operating expenses.

22. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On March 30, 2001, pursuant to an agreement in principal reached March 26,
2001, the Company sold 15,875,000 shares of restricted common stock to
unaffiliated third parties and to parties related to the Company through its
principal shareholder, including two directors, for total proceeds of $15,875
before expenses. This stock sale was subject to certain subsequent events,
including the effectiveness of the amendment to the credit facility discussed
below effective on April 2, 2001.

     On March 30, 2001, the Company executed an amendment to its senior secured
revolving syndicated credit facility which reduced the commitment under the
credit facility in stages from $50,000 to $20,000 pursuant to certain events,
expanded the borrowing base to include foreign receivables and certain assets of
iXL Ventures and eliminated and amended certain financial covenants. The amended
credit facility established certain EBITDA (earnings before interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenants for the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2001. This amendment to the credit facility became effective on
April 2, 2001. At June 30, 2001, the Company was in violation of a financial
covenant as defined under the credit facility. Effective August 10, 2001, the
lenders waived any event of default resulting from this covenant violation until
the earlier of the completion of the pending merger or November 30, 2001, and
the commitment under the credit facility was reduced to $8,050.

     On July 31, 2001, iXL and Scient Corporation jointly announced that they
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 31, 2001, which sets
forth the terms and conditions of a pending business combination of iXL and
Scient. Each share of iXL common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.25
shares of the new company's common stock, and each share of Scient common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive 0.31 shares of the new company's common
stock.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Consummation of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including
the approval by both iXL's and Scient's stockholders and the receipt of required
regulatory approvals. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement,
iXL and certain stockholders of Scient who own approximately 34% of the
outstanding common stock of Scient entered into a voting agreement pursuant to
which such Scient stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Scient common
stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Similarly, Scient and
certain stockholders of iXL who own approximately 34% of the outstanding common
stock of iXL entered into a voting agreement pursuant to which such iXL
stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of iXL common stock in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding interim financial reporting.
Accordingly, they do not contain all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2000. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a
fair statement of iXL's financial condition as of June 30, 2001, the results of
its operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 and its
cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. Certain items in the
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. During 2000, the Company deconsolidated both ProAct
Technologies Corp. and Digital Planet. The Company has presented its results of
operations and financial condition as if the deconsolidations occurred on
January 1, 2000. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination
of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Operating results for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2001.

3. PENDING MERGER WITH SCIENT CORPORATION

     On July 31, 2001, iXL and Scient Corporation jointly announced that they
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 31, 2001, which sets
forth the terms and conditions of a pending business combination of iXL and
Scient. Each share of iXL common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.25
shares of the new company's common stock, and each share of Scient common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive 0.31 shares of the new company's common
stock.

     Consummation of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including
the approval by both iXL's and Scient's stockholders and the receipt of required
regulatory approvals. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement,
iXL and certain stockholders of Scient who own approximately 34% of the
outstanding common stock of Scient entered into a voting agreement pursuant to
which such Scient stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Scient common
stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Similarly, Scient and
certain stockholders of iXL who own approximately 34% of the outstanding common
stock of iXL entered into a voting agreement pursuant to which such iXL
stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of iXL common stock in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     In May 2001, the Company announced that in a continued effort to reduce
costs and improve efficiency as part of its restructuring plan, it would effect
a workforce reduction of approximately 300 employees. This
                                       F-34

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

announcement succeeded announcements of a reduction of approximately 350
employees in September 2000 and approximately 850 employees in November 2000.
The Company substantially completed these reductions as of June 31, 2001. Of
these total reductions in workforce, approximately 1,010 were professional
services personnel, 360 were general and administrative personnel, and 130 were
in sales and marketing personnel. The restructuring was an effort to become a
more industry-focused company and to deliver a higher level of quality and depth
of expertise for our clients. As a result of this restructuring, the Company
recorded a charge of approximately $24,880,000 in 2001 and $76,588,000 in 2000.
Included in this total are approximately $38,463,000 of costs related to rent
and sublease expenses net of anticipated sublease income for abandoned office
leases, approximately $45,240,000 of costs resulting from the write-down of
leasehold improvements and equipment that were impaired as a result of the
closure of offices due to a decrease in demand for the Company's services and
resulting decrease in revenue and approximately $17,765,000 in severance due to
the reduction in workforce.

     The restructuring charges and their utilization as of June 30, 2001 are
summarized as follows (in thousands):

     The Company expects future cash expenditures related to these restructuring
activities to be approximately $20,111,000, of which approximately $8,730,000
the Company anticipates will be paid within the next twelve months.

5. IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     As a result of the continued changes in the dynamics of the demand for
Internet consulting services, the Company evaluated the recoverability of its
intangible assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The Company
reviewed the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by its operations.
These cash flows were below the carrying value of the goodwill recorded as a
result of the Company's acquisitions. Therefore, the Company adjusted the
carrying value of the goodwill and acquired workforce based on future discounted
cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $97,402,000 in the fourth
quarter of 2000 and an additional charge of $12,746,000 in the second quarter of
2001. Of the total impairment charge taken, $86,232,000 was a write-down of
assets recorded as a result of the Tessera acquisition.

6. CREDIT FACILITY

     On March 30, 2001, the Company executed an amendment to its senior secured
revolving syndicated credit facility which reduced the commitment under the
credit facility in stages from $50,000,000 to $20,000,000 pursuant to certain
events, expanded the borrowing base to include foreign receivables and certain
assets of iXL Ventures and eliminated and amended certain financial covenants.
The amended credit facility established certain EBITDA (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenants for the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2001. This amendment to the credit facility became
effective on April 2, 2001. At June 30, 2001, the Company was in violation of a
financial covenant as defined under the credit facility. Effective August 10,
2001, the lenders waived any event of default resulting from this covenant

                                       F-35

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

violation until the earlier of the completion of the pending merger or November
30, 2001 and the commitment under the credit facility was reduced to $8,050,000.

     At June 30, 2001, the Company had $3,700,000 in borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility and had utilized approximately $8,048,000 of the
credit facility for letters of credit issued primarily as security for office
leases. The Company repaid the borrowings outstanding in July 2001.

7. NOTE PAYABLE TO PROACT

     On December 19, 2000 the Company consummated a transaction with ProAct in
which iXL Ventures PHC, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, issued a 5.75% secured convertible note to ProAct in exchange for a
cash payment of $20,000,000. The note is secured by and exchangeable for, upon
satisfaction of certain conditions, ten million shares of common stock of ProAct
held by iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. has no other properties or
assets other than its interest in the ProAct common stock. The note is
non-recourse to iXL Enterprises, Inc. Additionally, in conjunction with the
issuance of the secured convertible note, the Company issued call rights to
ProAct to purchase up to ten million shares of its common stock owned by iXL
Ventures LP at a purchase price of $3.00 per share. The note accrues interest at
5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis. The entire amount of unpaid principal and
accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on January 7, 2004.

     The Company is required to make adjustments to the carrying value of the
note for changes in the fair value of ProAct's common stock because the terms of
the note enable ProAct to exchange the note for the pledged collateral. The
Company will record any resulting adjustment as interest income or interest
expense. The Company is also required to carry the call rights at their fair
value during their term with any resulting changes in the fair value being
recorded as other income or expense. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair value of the call rights. During the
three months ended June 30, 2001, the Company adjusted the value of the call
rights by approximately $6,983,000 and recorded this amount as other income.

8. SALE OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK

     On March 30, 2001, pursuant to an agreement in principle reached March 26,
2001, the Company sold 15,875,000 shares of restricted common stock to
unaffiliated third parties and to parties related to the Company through its
principal shareholder, including two directors, for proceeds of approximately
$15,875,000 before expenses.

10. AGREEMENT WITH HPS AMERICA, INC.

     On December 28, 2000 the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement
with HPS under which HPS purchased one million shares of the Company's common
stock at $3.00 per share. HPS paid $1,500,000

                                       F-36

                     IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

upon execution of the agreement. The remaining $1,500,000 was recorded as
subscription receivable in stockholders' equity. The Company agreed to
subcontract $65,000,000 of services to HPS over a three-year period. Services
that will be subcontracted to HPS include application software development,
migration, re-engineering, systems integration, service management and other
professional services. If the Company fails to meet this commitment, the Company
must pay HPS the difference between the commitment and the value of the business
actually given. The agreement was subsequently modified in June 2001 to extend
the time frame of the time period in which the Company's subcontracting of
services must occur by six months. Additionally, the modification delayed the
due date of the remaining $1,500,000 owed by HPS to March 31, 2002 and released
to HPS the 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock that had been pledged to
iXL until payment of the $1,500,000 was made.

11. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 mandates the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001
and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets
separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and
intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. The Company is required to
adopt SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The most significant changes made by SFAS 142
are that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be
amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The amortization
provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and assets acquired prior to July 1,
2001, the amortization provisions of SFAS 142 are effective upon adoption of
SFAS 142. The Company has not yet determined the impact that these standards
could have on its financial position or results of operations.

                    NOTE TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

     On July 30, 2001, India-Sierra Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") was
incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The
Company has the authority under its Certificate of Incorporation to issue 500
million shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common
Stock"), and 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the "Preferred Stock"). One share of common stock was issued on July 30, 2001
to each of iXL Enterprises, Inc. and Scient Corporation in exchange for $100.00
per share paid in cash. The Company has no assets other than cash and has not
commenced operations. The Company's activities to date have been solely related
to its incorporation.

  Common Stock

     It is anticipated that subject to any preferential rights of any of the
Company's Preferred Stock as designated by the Board of Directors of the
Company, each outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock will be entitled
to such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of
Directors of the Company. Each outstanding share will be entitled to one vote on
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. It is further anticipated that
in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders
of the Company's Common Stock will be entitled to receive on a pro rata basis
any assets remaining after provision for payment of creditors and after payment
of any liquidation preferences to holders of the Company's Preferred Stock.

  Preferred Stock

     It is anticipated that the Company's authorized Preferred Stock will be
available for issuance from time to time in one or more series at the discretion
of the Company's Board of Directors without stockholder approval. The Company's
Board of Directors will have the authority to prescribe for each series of the
Company's Preferred Stock to establish the number of shares in that series, the
voting rights (if any) to which such shares in that series will be entitled, the
consideration for such shares in that series and the designation, powers,
preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
such qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares in that series.
Depending upon the rights of such Preferred Stock, the issuance of the Company's
Preferred Stock could have an adverse effect on holders of the Company's Common
Stock, by delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, making
removal of the present management of the Company more difficult or resulting in
restrictions upon the payment of dividends and other distributions to the
holders of the Company Common Stock.

principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

                 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  The Company

     Scient Corporation ("Scient") was incorporated in California on November 7,
1997. Scient is a leading provider of the category of professional services
called systems innovation. Scient provides integrated eBusiness strategy and
technology implementation services on a global basis to clients who are creating
eBusinesses or are rethinking or expanding their existing businesses to
integrate eBusiness capabilities. These services include strategy consulting,
customer experience design, systems architecture, application and technology
infrastructure development and eBusiness management.

     During the second half of fiscal 2001 and the first quarter of fiscal 2002,
Scient announced reductions in its workforce, a reduction or closure of certain
of its offices, and its intention to relocate its corporate headquarters from
San Francisco, CA to New York, NY. As a result, Scient has recorded a charge in
the second half of fiscal 2001 of approximately $105 million related to
restructuring and other related charges. Scient also expects to take an
additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2001, see Notes 4
"Restructuring and Other Related Charges" and Note 12 "Subsequent Event."

  Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Scient Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments where
Scient does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
for using the cost method. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
period's financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Revenue Recognition

     Scient derives its revenues from service agreements. Revenues pursuant to
time and materials contracts are generally recognized as services are performed.
Revenues pursuant to fixed-fee contracts are generally recognized as services
are rendered on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting (based on the
ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs). Revenues exclude reimbursable
expenses charged to and collected from clients.

     Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a
contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses
become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Unbilled fees and services on
contracts are comprised of costs plus fees on certain contracts in excess of
contractual billings on such contracts. Advanced billings and billings in excess
of costs plus fees are classified as deferred revenue.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements," which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on
interpretations and practices followed by the SEC. SAB 101 was effective the
first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999 and
requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative
change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 20, "Accounting Changes". In June 2000, the
SEC

                                       F-46

                               SCIENT CORPORATION

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

issued SAB 101B, "Amendment: Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which
delayed implementation of SAB 101 until Scient's fourth fiscal quarter of 2000.
Scient has adopted SAB 101 with no known reportable changes in its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

  Professional Services

     Professional services expenses consist primarily of compensation and
benefits of Scient's employees engaged in the delivery of professional services.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Scient considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

  Restricted Cash

     Restricted cash includes a cash collateral account maintained under the
terms of a line of credit. In accordance with this agreement, we have created
and will maintain a cash collateral account that limits the liquidity of $18.6
million of our cash. (See Note 6)

  Investments

     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," Scient has
categorized its marketable securities as "available-for-sale." At March 31, 2000
and 2001, amortized cost approximated fair value and unrealized gains and losses
were insignificant.

     The portfolio of short-term investments (including cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash) consisted of the following (in thousands):

                                                                   MARCH 31,
                                                              -------------------

                                                              $161,073   $229,148
                                                              ========   ========

     Scient considers all investments with maturities of less than one year as
of March 31, 2001 to be short-term investments. Long term investments consist
primarily of marketable securities with original maturities of greater than
twelve months. In July 1999, Scient established a wholly owned subsidiary,
Scient Capital LLC, which serves as an investment vehicle to make equity
investments in clients who meet certain criteria.

     Investments in entities in which Scient has an equity interest of less then
20% and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are
accounted for under the cost method. At each balance sheet date, Scient assesses
the fair market value of its cost-based investments and recognizes any
identified impairment. As of March 31, 2001, all investments had been written
down to zero. (See Note 4)

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Concentration of Credit Risk

     Scient's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
expenses. At March 31, 2000 and 2001, the fair value of these instruments
approximated their financial statement carrying amounts.

     Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial
condition, and collateral generally is not required. Scient performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts.

     Scient is subject to concentrations of credit risk and interest rate risk
related to its short-term investments. Scient's credit risk is managed by
limiting the amount of investments placed with any one issuer, investing in
money market funds, and short-term commercial paper, and A1 rated corporate
bonds.

     The following table summarizes the revenue from clients in excess of 10% of
total revenue.

                                                              YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

Company D...................................................  11%     *        *

- ---------------

* Represented less than 10% of total.

     At March 31, 2001, the client that accounted for more than 10% of Scient's
revenue also represented 17% of accounts receivable. At March 31, 2000, no
clients accounted for more than 10% of Scient's revenue or accounts receivable.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Scient's financial instruments, including cash equivalents, restricted
cash, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and capital lease
obligations are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments.

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method ranging from
eighteen months to five years for computer equipment and software and furniture
and fixtures, which is deemed to be the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over
the term of the lease or estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.

  Stock Compensation

     Scient accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and complies with the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Under APB
25, unearned compensation is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the
grant, between the fair value of Scient's stock and the exercise price. Unearned
compensation is amortized and expensed in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 28. Scient accounts for stock-based
compensation issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity
Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services."
                                       F-48

                               SCIENT CORPORATION

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, ("FIN 44"),
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- an
Interpretation of APB 25. This Interpretation clarifies (a) the definition of
employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, (b) the criteria for determining
whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock
option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2000,
but certain conclusions in this Interpretation cover specific events that occur
after either December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000. To the extent that this
Interpretation covers events occurring during the period after December 15,
1998, or January 12, 2000, but before the effective date of July 1, 2000, the
effects of applying this Interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis
from July 1, 2000.

  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach, which
requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in Scient's financial statements or tax returns. The
measurements of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on
provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or
rates are not anticipated.

  Net Loss Per Share

     Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss
available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of
diluted net loss per share excludes potential common shares if the effect is
antidilutive. Potential common shares are composed of common stock subject to
repurchase rights and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants and upon conversion of Series A, B and C
convertible preferred stock.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and dilutive net
loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     Scient evaluates the recoverability of our long-lived assets in accordance
with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 121 requires recognition of
impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets
exceeds the future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Scient
assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable.

  Comprehensive Income

     Effective April 1, 1998, Scient adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130,
"Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets)
during a period from non-owner sources. The adoption of SFAS No. 130 had no
impact on Scient's net income or stockholders' equity.

  Segment Information

     Scient adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information." Scient identifies its operating
segments based on business activities, management responsibility and
geographical location. Scient engages in business activities in one operating
segment, which provides integrated eBusiness strategy and technology
implementation services to clients who are creating eBusinesses or are
rethinking or expanding their existing businesses to integrate eBusiness
capabilities.

     Scient engages in business activities in one operating segment, which

     Other international consists of the revenues and assets of operations in
Europe and Asia Pacific excluding Singapore.

  Advertising Expenses

     Scient expenses the cost of advertising and promoting its services as
incurred. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative in the
consolidated statements of operations and totaled $470,000, $4.4 million, and
$4.9 million for the years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

  Foreign Currency

     The functional currencies of the Scient's international subsidiaries are
the local currencies. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are
translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of exchange for
assets and liabilities and average rates during the period for revenues, cost of
revenues, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are accumulated as a
component of stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign
exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations
and were not significant during the periods presented.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which
establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. In July 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of
FASB No. 133," which amends SFAS No. 133 to be effective for all fiscal quarters
of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 138 "Accounting for Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133", effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after
June 15, 2000. As indicated, SFAS No 138 amends accounting and reporting
standards for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities.
Scient does not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect
on its results of consolidated operations, financial position, or cash flows.

2. BUSINESS COMBINATION

     In August 2000, Scient acquired AXIDIA, an eBusiness services firm located
in France. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement Scient paid cash of
approximately $7.7 million, and issued approximately 121,000

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock
of AXIDIA. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination
and accordingly, the results of AXIDIA's operations have been included in
Scient's financial statements from August 2000.

     The total consideration for the transaction was valued approximately $14.5
million, which includes the value of cash paid, common stock issued and other
direct acquisition costs. The purchase price has been allocated to the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and workforce-in-place. The
workforce-in-place has been recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized on
a straight-line basis over 2 years.

     The historical results of operations of AXIDIA for the periods ended March
31, 1999 and 2000 were not material to the consolidated results of operations of
Scient for the respective periods.

3. BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS

     Allowance for doubtful accounts are estimated and established based on
specific circumstances of each customer. Additions to the allowance are charged
to selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts receivables are
written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is
deemed uncollectible. Recoveries on account receivable previously charged off as
uncollectible are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in
the account receivable allowance were as follows (in thousands):

4. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER RELATED CHARGES

     For the year ended March 31, 2001, Scient recorded restructuring and other
related charges of $105 million, consisting of $14 million for headcount
reductions, $81 million for consolidation of facilities and related fixed
assets, and $10 million of other restructuring related charges. These
restructuring and other related charges were taken to align Scient's cost
structure with changing market conditions and decreased demand for Scient's
services to create a more flexible and efficient organization. The plan resulted
in headcount reduction of approximately 460 employees, which was made up of
approximately 67% professional services staff, and 33% core services staff. Many
of the positions that were eliminated related to the office closures in Austin,
Texas and Sunnyvale, California facilities. In January 2001, Scient also closed
its office in Munich, Germany, which was contemplated in December with the other
restructuring plans.

     Total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities will
be approximately $71 million. The remaining $34 million of restructuring and
other related costs consists of non-cash charges primarily for asset write-offs.
As of the end of the year of fiscal 2001, $25 million of cash was used for
restructuring and other related costs. Approximately $11 million cash outlay is
expected in the first quarter of 2002, and the remaining cash outlay of
approximately $35 million, primarily related to real estate rental obligations,
is expected to occur over the next 10 years.

     As a result of the deterioration in eBusiness markets, Scient also
evaluated the investments held by Scient Capital LLC and determined that these
investments had become impaired. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $6.0
million has been recorded to write these investments down to zero, their
estimated fair value at March 31, 2001. This charge has been reported on the
statement of operations as a component of restructuring and other related
charges. Scient does not anticipate making any further investments through
Scient Capital.

5. INCOME TAXES

     At March 31, 2000 and 2001, Scient had approximately $18.0 million and
$43.9 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available and $22.5
million and $49.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to
offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2020
and 2008, respectively. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in
certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amount of net
operating losses that Scient may utilize in any one year include, but are not
limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over a
three year period.

     Scient has incurred losses for the year ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001. Management believes that, based on the history of such losses and other
factors, the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than
not that Scient will not be able to realize its deferred tax assets and thus a
full valuation reserve has been recorded at March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. The
effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate
primarily due to the inability to recognize the benefit of net operating losses.

     Deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):

                                                               YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

6. BORROWING

     In May 1998, Scient entered into an equipment lease line and a line of
credit under a Loan and Security Agreement.

     In February 2000, Scient amended the Loan and Security Agreement to
increase the equipment lease line to $4.0 million and the line of credit to $9.2
million. The equipment lease line's draw down expires during
                                       F-54

                               SCIENT CORPORATION

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the period of May 1999 through September 2000. The amounts available at March
31, 2001 were $1.8 million and $650,000, respectively. Interest will accrue from
the date of each draw down at a rate of one percent plus prime per annum and is
payable monthly through the expiration date, which is no later than September
2000. The line of credit expires in May 2000 and charges interest at a rate of
one-half percent plus prime per annum. Substantially all of the assets of Scient
are pledged as collateral for Scient's credit facilities.

     At March 31, 2000, Scient had $2.2 million balance outstanding under the
equipment lease line. Interest rates at March 31, 2000 was 8.75%. Scient paid
its outstanding balances on the equipment line of credit in April 2000.

     In April 2000, Scient entered into a $40.0 million line of credit agreement
with a bank. In September 2000, the line of credit was increased to $50.0
million. Borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at either the LIBOR
rate plus a range of 2.25% to 2.75% or the bank's prime rate plus up to 0.5%
depending on the outstanding balance and the type of draws. Fourteen standby
letters of credit totaling $41.9 million have been issued against this line of
credit. Under this line of credit, Scient is required to maintain certain
financial covenants. At March 31, 2001, Scient was in compliance with all such
covenants. In addition, Scient is also required to maintain a certain cash
balance in a restricted account to be used as collateral against the letters of
credit issued under this line of credit. Substantially all of the assets of
Scient are pledged as collateral for Scient's credit facilities. No borrowing is
made against this line of credit at March 31, 2001.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Leases

     Scient leases office space and equipment under noncancelable operating and
capital leases with various expiration dates through 2022. Rent expense for the
years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $1.2 million, $5.7 million and
$18.6 million, respectively. Sublease income for the years ended March 31, 2000
and 2001 was $463,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. The terms of the facility
leases provide for rental payments on a graduated scale. Scient recognizes rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has recognized
prepaid expense for rent expenditures not incurred but paid.

     Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital
leases at March 31, 2001 are as follows (in thousands):

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Letters of Credit

     Scient has issued letters of credit with various financial institutions in
the aggregate amount of $41.9 million as security deposits for certain of its
lease commitments.

  Contingencies

     From time to time, Scient may have certain contingent liabilities that
arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Scient accrues
contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made
and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,
there are no pending claims of which the outcome is expected to result in a
material adverse effect in the financial position or results of operations of
Scient.

8. TRANSACTIONS WITH ENTITIES RELATED TO DIRECTORS

     A director and a shareholder of Scient, is also a director and shareholder
of two clients from which Scient recognized $3.7 million, $4.9 million, and
$14.1 million in revenue for the year ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The terms and conditions of such transactions were normal and
customary. Balance due from this clients as of March 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1.0
million and $6.2 million, respectively.

9. COMMON STOCK

     In March 1999, Scient's Board of Directors authorized, and in April 1999
the stockholders approved, the reincorporation of Scient in the State of
Delaware. Following the reincorporation, Scient is authorized to issue 40.0
million shares of $.0001 par value Common Stock and 11.5 million shares of
$.0001 par value Preferred Stock. In May 1999, upon the effectiveness of the
initial public offering, 125.0 million shares of common stock and 10.0 million
shares of undesignated convertible preferred stock were authorized. The Board of
Directors has the authority to issue the undesignated Preferred Stock in one or
more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
thereof.

     In May 1999, Scient completed an initial public offering of 6.9 million
shares of Scient's common stock. Proceeds to Scient, from this initial public
offering totaled approximately $62.7 million net of offering cots of $1.5
million. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, Scient's convertible
preferred stock converted into 29.5 million shares of common stock.

     In January 2000, Scient completed a follow-on offering of 1.9 million
shares of Scient's common stock. Proceeds to Scient from this additional
offering totaled approximately $154.3 million net of offering costs of $779,000.

     In April 2000, the shareholders approved an increase in its authorized
common shares from 125.0 million to 500.0 million. A portion of the shares sold
are subject to the right of repurchase by Scient subject to vesting, which is
generally over a four year period from the employee hire date until vesting is
complete. At March 31, 2000 and 2001, there were 11.6 million and 7.7 million
shares subject to repurchase, respectively.

  Founder's Stock Agreement

     Certain common stock was issued to the founder of Scient and is subject to
repurchase in the event of voluntary termination or involuntary termination with
cause. Seventy-five percent of the shares vested over a one-year period. The
remaining 25% generally vest over an additional three-year period. In the event
of termination without cause, a substantial sale of Scient's assets, or a
merger, all remaining shares would immediately vest. At March 31, 2000 and 2001,
approximately 2.5 million and 1.3 million shares, respectively, of outstanding
common stock were subject to repurchase by Scient at the original purchase price
of $0.000025.

  Warrants for Common Stock

     In May 1999, Scient entered into a 24-month consulting agreement with a
company for recruiting services. Scient paid $500,000, issued 300,000 shares of
common stock and granted an option to purchase an additional 100,000 shares at
$6.00 per share. Scient, using the Black-Scholes pricing model, calculated the
fair value of the option on the date of grant, and recognized the total value of
the agreement over the service period.

  Stock Split

     In December 1999, Scient effected a two-for-one stock-split of its common
stock. All data shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock splits.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

  401(k) Savings Plan

     Scient has a savings plan (the "Savings Plan") that qualifies as a defined
contribution arrangement under Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 501(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating employees may defer
a percentage (not to exceed 25%) of their eligible pretax earnings up to the
Internal Revenue Service's annual contribution limit. Under the Savings Plan,
Scient may, but is not obligated to, match a portion of the employee
contributions. Scient has not contributed to the Savings Plan to date.

11. STOCK OPTION PLANS

  2000 Stock Plan

     In June 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Stock Plan (the "2000
Plan") and reserved 3.0 million shares for issuance thereunder. In January 2001,
and every year thereafter, shares reserved for issuance will automatically
increase by a number equal to the lesser of 5% of the total number of common
stock outstanding or 5.0 million shares. The 2000 Plan authorized the award of
options and restricted stock awards. Options granted under the 2000 Plan are
nonqualified stock options ("NSO"). NSOs may be granted to Scient's employees,
outside directors, and consultants of Scient, except that members of the Board
and individuals who are considered officers of Scient under the rules of the
National Association of Securities Dealers shall not be eligible for the grant.

     Options under the 2000 Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years
and generally vest 25% of the options after one month from the date of grant,
with the remaining options vesting in equally monthly installments over the
following 36 months.

  1999 Equity Incentive Plan

     In March 1999, the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders
approved, the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan (the "1999 Plan") and reserved 6.4
million shares as amended in February 2000 plus the aggregate number of shares
available under the 1997 Stock Option Plan of common stock for issuance
thereunder. In January 2000, and every year thereafter, shares reserved for
issuance will automatically increase by a number equal to the lesser of 10% as
amended in February 2000 of the total number of common stock outstanding or 10.0
million shares. The 1999 Plan authorized the award of options, restricted stock
awards and stock bonuses (the "Award"). No person will be eligible to receive
more than 1.0 million shares in any calendar year pursuant to the 1999 Plan
other than a new employee of Scient who will be eligible to receive no more than
2.0 million shares in the calendar year in which such employee commences
employment. Options granted under the 1999 Plan may either be incentive stock
options ("ISO") or NSOs. ISOs may be granted only to Scient's

                                       F-57

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

employees (including officers and directors who are also employees). NSOs may be
granted to Scient's employees, outside directors, and consultants of Scient.

     Options under the 1999 Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years
and generally vest 25% of the options after one year from the date of grant,
with the remaining options vesting in equally monthly installments over the
following 36 months.

  1997 Stock Option Plan

     In December 1997, Scient adopted the Scient Corporation 1997 Stock Option
Plan (the "1997 Plan"). The 1997 Plan provides for the granting of stock options
to employees, outside directors, and consultants of Scient. Options granted
under the 1997 Plan may either be ISOs or NSOs. Scient reserved 13.4 million
shares of common stock for issuance under the 1997 Plan. The 1997 Plan provided
that the options should be exercisable over a period not to exceed ten years
from the date of the grant.

     Options are generally exercisable immediately and are subject to repurchase
by Scient, with the repurchase restriction lapsing at such times and under such
conditions as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted to date
generally vest 25% of the options after one year from date of grant, with the
remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the following 36
months.

  1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     In April 1999, the board of directors and stockholders adopted the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), which became effective immediately
prior to the effective date of Scient's initial public offering. The ESPP
reserved 2.0 million shares of Common Stock for issuance thereunder. On each May
1 beginning in 2000, the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under
the ESPP will be increased automatically to 2.0 million shares. Employees
generally will be eligible to participate in the ESPP if they are employed by
Scient for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in a calendar
year and are not (and would not become as a result of being granted an option
under the ESPP) 5% stockholders of Scient. Under the ESPP, eligible employees
may select a rate of payroll deduction up to 15% of their cash compensation
subject to certain maximum purchase limitations. The first offering period began
on the first business day on which price quotations for Scient's common stock
were available on The Nasdaq National Market. The first purchase period was less
than six months long. Offering Periods thereafter will begin on May 1 and
November 1. Purchases will occur on April 30 and October 31, or the last day of
trading prior to these dates. The price at which the common stock is purchased
under the ESPP is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of Scient's Common
Stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of
that purchase period.

         NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Fair Value Disclosures

     Scient applies the measurement principles of APB No. 25 in accounting for
its stock option plan. Had compensation expense for options granted for the
years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Scient's net loss would
have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

                                                             YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

     Scient calculated the minimum fair value of each option grant on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No.
123 using the following assumptions:

                                                              YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,
                                                              ---------------------
                                                              2001    2000    1999
                                                              -----   -----   -----

Risk Free Interest Rate.....................................  5.50%   5.65%   5.26%
Expected lives (in years)...................................     4       4       5
Dividend yield..............................................     0%      0%      0%
Expected volatility.........................................   122%     60%      0%

     Because additional option grants are expected to be made each year, the
pro-forma impact for the years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 is not
representative of the pro-forma effects which may be expected in future years.

  Unearned Stock-based Compensation

     In connection with certain stock option grants for the years ended March
31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, Scient recognized unearned stock-based compensation
totaling $33.4 million, $5.2 million, and $(1.3 million), respectively, which is
being amortized over the vesting periods, generally four years, of the related
options. Amortization expense recognized for the years ended March 31, 1999,
2000 and 2001 totaled approximately $7.7 million, $15.6 million, and $9.4
million, respectively.

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On April 11, 2001, Scient announced an additional restructuring initiative
that included a reduction in force of up to 850 people. The restructuring
included plans to downsize and modify the company's geographic footprint and
move its corporate headquarters to New York from San Francisco. In addition,
Scient closed its Los Angeles and New Jersey offices and plans to reduce its San
Francisco, Boston, and Chicago locations to smaller offices.

     As part of the restructuring initiative, in June 2001 Scient divested
itself 80.1% of its interest in Scient S.A., its French subsidiary, and 81% of
its interest in Scient K.K., its Japanese subsidiary. Scient also licensed the
use of the Scient trademark to the French company for 120 days and to the
Japanese company for one year in order to allow the businesses to transition to
new branding.

              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Scient Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Investments where Scient does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence are accounted for using the cost method. All investments under this
method have been considered impaired and written its value to zero according to
our management. The accompanying condensed consolidated financials statements
are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, contain all the adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to
present fairly the financial position, the results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applicable to interim periods. Results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or for
any future period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the
year ended March 31, 2001 included in Scient's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2. INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE

     Basic net income (loss) per share is determined by using the weighed
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
(loss) per share is determined by using the weighted average number of common
shares, unvested common shares subject to repurchase, and common stock
equivalents (representing the dilutive effect of stock options) outstanding
during the period. Scient's net earning (loss) has not been adjusted for any
period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted net loss per share.
For purposes of computing diluted net earning (loss) per share, weighted average
common share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price
that exceeded the average fair market value of Scient's common stock for that
period.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net income as
currently reported under generally accepted accounting principles and also
considers the affect of additional economic events that are not required to be
recorded in determining net income but are rather reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Scient

                                       F-64

                               SCIENT CORPORATION

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

reports foreign currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and
losses on short term investments as components of comprehensive income. For the
three months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, Scient recorded comprehensive loss of
$66.3 million and comprehensive income of $5.8 million, respectively.

4. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER RELATED CHARGES

     In April 2001, Scient recorded a restructuring and other related charges of
$50 million, consisting of $34 million for headcount reductions, $4 million for
consolidation of facilities and related fixed assets, and $12 million of other
related restructuring charges. These restructuring and other related charges
were taken to align Scient's cost structure with changing market conditions and
decreased demand for Scient's services and to create a more flexible and
efficient organization. The plan resulted in headcount reductions of
approximately 850 employees, which was made up of 78% professional services
staff and 22% core services staff. The April restructuring included plans to
significantly downsize and modify Scient's geographic footprint and move its
corporate headquarters to New York from San Francisco. In addition, Scient
closed its Los Angeles and New Jersey offices, divested 80% of its interests in
each of its French and Japanese subsidiaries and plans to reduce its San
Francisco, Boston, and Chicago locations to smaller sales offices.

     Total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities that
were announced in December 2000 and April 2001 will be approximately $112
million. The remaining $43 million of restructuring and other related costs
consists of non-cash charges primarily for asset write-offs. As of the end of
the first quarter of fiscal 2002, $67 million of cash has been used for
restructuring and other related costs. An additional $19 million cash outlay is
expected in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, and the remaining cash outlay of
approximately $26 million, primarily related to real estate rental obligations,
is expected to occur over the next 10 years.

     Restructuring and other related activities as of June 30, 2001 were as
follow (in millions):

     As a result of the divestiture in the first quarter of 2002 of more than
80% of our French subsidiary, which we acquired in August 2000, Scient wrote off
its remaining goodwill balance related to this acquisition of $9.3 million to
restructuring and other related charges. This charge has been reported on the
statement of operations as a component of restructuring and other related
charges.

6. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for business combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 38, Accounting
for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. All business
combinations in the scope of this Statement are to be accounted for using one
method, the purchase method. The provisions of this Statement apply to all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and all business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method for which the date of
acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. We have engaged in significant
acquisition activity in the past, including business combinations, and future
business combinations are likely. The provisions of this Statement would require
all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method.

     In June 2001, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for i) intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets
(but not those acquired in a business combination) at acquisition and ii)
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This
Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. Under the provisions
of this Statement, if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite
useful life, it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be
no longer indefinite. An intangible asset that is not subject to amortization
shall be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill shall not
be amortized. Goodwill shall be tested for impairment on an annual basis and
between annual tests in certain circumstances at a level of reporting referred
to as a reporting unit. This Statement is required to be applied starting with
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001 will be subject immediately to the nonamortization
and amortization provisions of this Statement. Scient is still evaluating the
impact of adopting these pronouncements on the financial statements.

7. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     On July 31, 2001, Scient entered into a definitive agreement with iXL
Enterprises, Inc., providing for a strategic merger of equals, whereby Scient
and iXL will become subsidiaries of a new parent company operating under the
Scient name. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, each share of iXL and
Scient common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.25 and 0.31 of a share,
respectively, of the new holding company's common stock. Approximately 34% of
the shareholders of each company have executed voting agreements by which they
have agreed to vote their respective shares in favor of the merger. The merger
agreement, which has been approved by the board of directors for both companies,
is subject to approval by both iXL's and Scient's stockholders, receipt of
required regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. The merger is
expected to close in the December quarter of 2001.

day of July 2001, by and among INDIA-SIERRA HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Holdco"), IXL ENTERPRISES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("iXL"),
SCIENT CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Scient"), INDIA MERGER SUB, INC., a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco ("India

wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco ("Sierra Merger Sub").

                                    RECITALS

     1. The Board of Directors of each of Scient and iXL (each, a "Company," and
collectively, the "Companies") deem it fair, advisable and in the best interests
of the relevant Company and its stockholders that Scient and iXL engage in a
business combination constituting a merger of equals in order to implement and
advance the long-term strategic business, prospects, interests and objectives of
both Companies;

     2. The combination of the Companies shall be effected in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement through each of the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated thereby;

     3. In furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors of each of Scient, iXL,
Holdco, India Merger Sub and Sierra Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and
the Mergers, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, pursuant to which each share of capital stock of Scient and each
share of capital stock of iXL issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive shares of capital
stock of Holdco as set forth herein;

     4. As a condition precedent and inducement to each Company's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of each of Scient and iXL, as
applicable, shall each enter into a voting agreement of even date herewith, in
the forms of Exhibit A hereto (collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), pursuant

Agreement; and

     5. For purposes of U.S. Federal and state income tax, the parties hereto
intend for the Mergers to qualify as reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

                        HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

     1.1. Organization of Holdco.  Scient and iXL have caused Holdco to be
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The authorized capital stock

     1.2. Directors and Officers of Holdco.  Prior to the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Holdco shall consist of equal numbers of
representatives of iXL and Scient as designated and elected by iXL and Scient.
iXL and Scient shall take all requisite action to cause the directors and
officers of Holdco at the Effective Time to be as provided in Section 6.2, and
with such duly constituted committees of the Board as

                                       A-8

provided in Section 6.2, with each such director and officer to remain in office
until his or her successor is duly elected, appointed and qualified in
accordance with the Holdco Bylaws.

     1.3. Organization of Merger Subsidiaries.  Holdco has caused India Merger
Sub and Sierra Merger Sub (collectively, the "Merger Subsidiaries") to be
organized for the sole purpose of effectuating the Mergers contemplated herein.
The authorized capital stock of Sierra Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares have been issued to
Holdco at a price of $1.00 per share. The authorized capital stock of India
Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which shares have been issued to Holdco at a price of $1.00 per share.

     1.4. Actions of Scient and iXL.  Scient and iXL, as the holders of all the
outstanding shares of Holdco Common Stock, have approved this Agreement and have
caused Holdco, as the sole stockholder of each of the Merger Subsidiaries, to
adopt this Agreement. Each of Scient and iXL shall cause Holdco, and Holdco
shall cause the Merger Subsidiaries, to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                      THE MERGERS; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

no event later than the second Business Day after) the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of the last to occur of the conditions (excluding
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date)
set forth in Article 7, unless this Agreement theretofore has been terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by

of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by and executed
and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Mergers shall
become effective at (i) the date and time each of the certificate of merger
relating to the Scient Merger and the certificate of merger relating to the iXL
Merger (collectively, the "Certificates of Merger") are duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or (ii) such subsequent time as the
Companies shall agree and as shall be specified in the respective Certificates
of Merger; provided, however that the Mergers shall become effective at the same

     Option Plan, as amended (the "96 Plan"), whether or not then vested or
     exercisable, shall terminate pursuant to Section 4.2(b) of the 96 Plan and
     be forfeited. To the extent applicable, prior to the date on which the
     shareholders of iXL approve the iXL Merger, the Board of Directors of iXL
     shall determine, pursuant to Section 4.4 of the 96 Plan, that none of the
     96 Options shall accelerate as a result of the iXL Merger or any of the
     transactions contemplated thereby.

     Time. The Board of Directors of iXL shall provide notice thereof to the
     holders of the Tessera Options and shall take all actions necessary
     pursuant to Section 16 of the Tessera Plan to cause the termination of the

     vested or exercisable, and to the extent (and only to the extent) they do
     not terminate by their terms at the Effective Time, to be exchanged for an
     option to purchase shares of Holdco Common Stock (the "Holdco Stock
     Options") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the 99
     Option, (i) in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
     number of shares of iXL Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
     respective 99 Options by the iXL Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
     down to the nearest whole share, and (ii) at a price per share (rounded up
     to the nearest 1/100th of a percent) equal to the per share exercise price
     under the respective 99 Options divided by the iXL Exchange Ratio;
     provided, however, that in the case of any 99 Option intended to be an
     incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, the foregoing shall

     Board of Directors shall take such actions as necessary to terminate iXL's
     2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "iXL Purchase Plan"), pursuant to
     Section 8.2 thereof; provided, however, such termination shall be
     conditioned upon

                                       A-12

     the consummation of the iXL Merger and shall be made effective as of the

consistent therewith, including the reservation and issuance of shares of Holdco
Common Stock sufficient to cover the exercise, in full, of such warrants.

     2.12. Certain Adjustments.  If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by Sections 5.1 and 5.2), the outstanding
shares of iXL Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Scient Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number of shares or different class or series, in any such case, by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, subdivision,
combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, or if any similar event
shall have occurred, the applicable Merger Consideration shall be appropriately

as applicable, and iXL Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     3.1. Exchange Fund.  Prior to the Effective Time, iXL and Scient shall
cause Holdco to appoint a mutually acceptable commercial bank or trust company
with assets in excess of $500,000,000 to act as exchange agent hereunder for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates for the applicable Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Scient
Common Stock and iXL Common Stock, Certificates representing the shares of the
Holdco Common Stock issuable in the Mergers pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 2.9.
Holdco agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 3.5. Any cash and certificates representing Holdco Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

     3.2. Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Holdco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate (i) a letter of
transmittal that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as iXL or Scient may reasonably specify (such
letter to be reasonably acceptable to Scient and iXL prior to the Effective
Time), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) such shares of Holdco
Common Stock (which, at Holdco's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by
applicable law) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 or 2.9 (after
taking into account all shares of Scient Common Stock and iXL Common Stock then
held by such holder), and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such
holder has the right to receive in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdco
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable pursuant to Section 3.5. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of
                                       A-13

such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not payable.

     3.3. Dividends.  No dividends, interest or other distributions with respect
to securities of Holdco shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Article
3. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the securities of Holdco have been registered, all dividends,
interest and other distributions payable in respect of such securities on a date
subsequent to, and in respect of a record date after, the Effective Time.

     3.4. No Further Ownership Rights in Stock.  All shares of Holdco Common
Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Scient Common Stock or
iXL Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article 2 and this Article 3
(including cash in lieu of fractional shares paid pursuant to Section 3.5) shall
be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Scient Common Stock and iXL Common Stock, as
applicable.

     3.5. No Fractional Shares of Holdco Common Stock.

          (a) No certificates or scrip or shares of Holdco Common Stock
     representing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock or any interests
     therein or rights thereto or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
     upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share
     interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights
     of a stockholder of Holdco or a holder of shares of Holdco Common Stock.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
     of shares of Scient Common Stock or iXL Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
     the Mergers who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of
     a share of Holdco Common Stock (determined after taking into account all
     Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
     (without any interest thereon) in an amount equal to the product of (x)
     such fractional part of a share of Holdco Common Stock, and

          (y) the closing sale price for a share of Holdco Common Stock as
     reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the trading day next following the
     date on which the Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after
     the determination of the amount of such cash, if any, to be paid to holders
     of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Holdco,
     and Holdco shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall
     cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
     share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

     3.6. Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall, at Holdco's request, be delivered to Holdco or otherwise
on the written instruction of Holdco, and holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall after such delivery look only to
Holdco for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Scient Common
Stock or iXL Common Stock, as applicable, formerly represented thereby to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 2.7, 2.9 and 3.2, and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Scient Common Stock or iXL Common
Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
law, become the property of Holdco, free and clear of any claims, liens or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     3.7. No Liability.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Holdco, iXL, India Merger Sub, Scient, Sierra Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     3.8. Investment of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Holdco on a daily basis;
provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to holders of Scient Common Stock or iXL Common Stock pursuant to
Article 2

                                       A-14

and the provisions of this Article 3. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall promptly be paid to Holdco.

     3.9. Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be so lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdco,
the posting by such Person of a bond or other collateral security in such
reasonable amount as Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Scient Common
Stock or iXL Common Stock, as applicable, formerly represented thereby, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on shares of Holdco Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

     3.10. Further Assurances.  At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of Holdco will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of iXL, India Merger Sub, Scient or Sierra Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of iXL, India Merger Sub, Scient or Sierra Merger Sub, any other actions
and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Holdco and/or
India Merger Sub, as the case may be, any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired
by Holdco and/or India Merger Sub, as the case may be, as a result of or in
connection with the Mergers.

     3.11. Stock Transfer Books.  The stock transfer books of Scient and iXL
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Scient Common Stock or iXL Common
Stock thereafter on the records of Scient or iXL. On and after the Effective
Time, all Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Holdco for any reason
shall be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Scient Common Stock or iXL Common Stock formerly
represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco
Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5).

                                   ARTICLE 4

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     4.1. Representations and Warranties of iXL.  Except as disclosed in the iXL
Filed SEC Reports or as set forth in the iXL Disclosure Schedule delivered by
iXL to Scient prior to the date hereof (the "iXL Disclosure Schedule"), iXL
represents and warrants to Scient as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

             (i) Each of iXL and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
        organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
        the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
        requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
        and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
        failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have
        such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, does not
        have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
        Effect on iXL, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business
        in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
        ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
        necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to
        qualify or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
        does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
        Adverse Effect on iXL. The copies of the certificate of incorporation
        and bylaws of iXL and its Subsidiaries which were previously furnished
        or made available to Scient are true, complete and correct copies of
        such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

             (ii) Exhibit 21.1 to iXL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
        fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, includes all the Subsidiaries of
        iXL which as of the date of this Agreement are "Significant
        Subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the
        Securities and Exchange

                                       A-15

        Commission (the "SEC")). All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
        or other equity and ownership interests in, each such Significant
        Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
        and, except as set forth in such Exhibit 21.1, are owned directly or
        indirectly by iXL, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
        charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
        whatsoever (collectively "Liens") and free of all restrictions
        (including restrictions on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
        of such capital stock or other ownership interests), except for
        restrictions imposed by applicable U.S. Federal securities laws.

          (b) Capital Structure.

             (i) The authorized capital stock of iXL consists of (A) 200,000,000
        shares of iXL Common Stock, of which 96,775,370 shares were outstanding
        on July 17, 2001, and (B) 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value
        $0.01 per share, none of which are outstanding. All issued and
        outstanding shares of the capital stock of iXL have been duly authorized
        and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free of
        preemptive rights. At the date hereof there are no options, warrants or
        other rights to acquire any shares of capital stock from iXL, other than
        (y) the iXL Stock Options representing in the aggregate the right to
        purchase approximately 19,000,000 shares of iXL Common Stock pursuant to
        the iXL Stock Plans and (z) the right to acquire from iXL 3,595,000
        shares of iXL Common Stock pursuant to those certain Warrants disclosed
        in Section 4.1(b) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "iXL
        Warrants").

             (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of iXL
        having the right to vote on any matters on which holders of capital
        stock of iXL may vote ("iXL Voting Debt") are issued or outstanding.

             (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 4.1(b) or in
        Section 4.1(b) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities,
        options, warrants, calls, puts, rights, commitments, agreements, plans,
        contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which iXL or any
        of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound
        obligating iXL or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
        cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
        stock or other voting securities of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries or
        obligating iXL or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
        enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, put, right,
        commitment, agreement, plan, contract, arrangement or undertaking.
        Except as disclosed in Section 4.1(b) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule,
        there are no outstanding obligations of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries
        to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of
        iXL or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

             (i) iXL has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
        into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
        hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the iXL Merger to the
        adoption of this Agreement by the Required iXL Vote. The execution and
        delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by iXL of the
        transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
        necessary corporate action on the part of iXL and no other corporate
        proceedings on the part of iXL are necessary to authorize the execution
        and delivery by iXL of this Agreement or to consummate the iXL Merger
        and the other transactions contemplated hereby, subject in the case of
        the consummation of the iXL Merger to the adoption of this Agreement by
        the Required iXL Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and
        delivered by iXL and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of iXL,
        enforceable against iXL in accordance with its terms, except as such
        enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
        moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally
        or by general equity principles (regardless of whether such
        enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

             (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by iXL do not,
        and the consummation by iXL of the iXL Merger and the other transactions
        contemplated hereby will not conflict with or result in any violation of
        or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
        both)

        obligation or the loss of a benefit under or the creation of a Lien,
        charge, "put" or "call" right or other encumbrance on or the loss of any
        assets, including Intellectual Property (any such conflict, violation,
        default, right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration,
        loss or creation, a "Violation"), pursuant to: (A) any provision of the
        certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational
        document of iXL or any Significant Subsidiary of iXL, or (B) except as
        set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule and, except
        with respect to employee stock options and other awards, and (1) as,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
        have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL, or (2) would not prevent or
        materially delay the consummation of the Mergers, subject to obtaining
        or making the consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations,
        registrations, declarations and filings referred to in clause (iii) of
        this Section 4.1(c), any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond,
        indenture, deed, lease, benefit plan, or any other agreement,
        obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license,
        judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
        applicable to iXL or any Subsidiary of iXL or their respective
        properties or assets.

             (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
        registration, declaration or filing with, any supranational, national,
        state, municipal, local or foreign government, any instrumentality,

        authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental or private body exercising

        quasi-governmental authority (a "Governmental Entity") or any other
        Person is required by or with respect to iXL or any Subsidiary of iXL in

        antitrust or other competition laws of other jurisdictions, and (H) such
        other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
        declarations and filings the failure of which to make or obtain,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
        have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL. Consents, approvals, orders,
        authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required under
        or in relation to any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are
        hereinafter referred to as "Necessary Consents".

        date hereof, (A) the name of each Person (other than any Person that is
        a Subsidiary of iXL) in which iXL or any of its Subsidiaries owns any
        capital stock or other equity interests (or any securities convertible
        into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or options or other rights to
        acquire, any capital stock or other equity interests in, any such
        Person) (each such Person being hereinafter referred to as an "iXL
        Minority Interest") and (B) the current percentage ownership interest
        and, to the knowledge of iXL, the fully diluted percentage ownership
        interest, in each case of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries therein. Except
        for the iXL Minority Interests, neither iXL nor any of its Subsidiaries
        (1) owns any capital stock or other equity interest (or any securities
        convertible into or exchangeable for, or options or other rights to
        acquire, any capital stock or other equity interest) in any Third Party
        or (2) is obligated to make any investment in any Third Party such that
        such Third Party would become a iXL Minority Interest.

             (ii) Section 4.1(d) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule lists each
        agreement or arrangement (x) between iXL or any of its Subsidiaries, on
        the one hand, and any iXL Minority Interest or any Person that owns any
        capital stock or other equity interests (or any securities convertible
        into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or options or other rights to
        acquire, any such capital stock or other equity interests) in any iXL
        Minority Interest, on the other hand, and (y) to which iXL or any of its

        Subsidiaries is a party which (A) has affected or is reasonably likely
        to affect the ability of Holdco to direct and control iXL's or its
        Subsidiaries' interest in an iXL Minority Interest after consummation of
        the Mergers or (B) evidences (1) any commitment (whether or not

        Interest or any of its Subsidiaries or (2) any other future liabilities
        or obligations in respect thereof of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (e) Reports and Financial Statements.

             (i) iXL has filed all required registration statements,
        prospectuses, notifications, reports, schedules, forms, statements and
        other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
        2000, (collectively, including all exhibits and schedules thereto, the
        "iXL SEC Reports"). Except as set forth in Section 4.1(d) of the iXL
        Disclosure Schedule, no Subsidiary of iXL is required to file any form,
        report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the
        SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
        prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each iXL SEC
        Report filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue
        statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
        necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading.
        Each iXL SEC Report that is a registration statement, as amended or
        supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of
        the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
        not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
        material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
        statements therein not misleading. Each of the financial statements
        (including the related notes) included in the iXL SEC Reports presents
        fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
        and consolidated results of operations and cash flows of iXL and its
        consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the
        respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with United
        States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently
        applied during the periods and at the respective dates involved except
        as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited
        interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal
        year-end adjustments that have not been and are not reasonably expected
        to be material in amount. All of such iXL SEC Reports, at their
        respective dates (and at the date of any amendment to the respective iXL
        SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the
        applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
        the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

             (ii) Except as disclosed in the iXL SEC Reports filed and publicly
        available prior to the date hereof (the "iXL Filed SEC Reports"), iXL
        and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities that are of a
        nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of iXL
        and its Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity
        with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
        business, (B) liabilities incurred in accordance with Section 5.1, (C)
        liabilities for Taxes, or (D) liabilities that, individually or in the
        aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
        Effect on iXL.

             (iii) iXL's aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and short term
        investments at June 30, 2001, were approximately $25,578,000.00.

          (f) Information Supplied.

             (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by iXL for
        inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 will, at the
        time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
        supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
        Act or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
        fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
        necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, and
        (B) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first
        mailed to Scient stockholders or iXL stockholders or at the time of the
        Scient Stockholders Meeting or the iXL Stockholders Meeting, contain any
        untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
        necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
        circumstances under which
                                       A-18

        they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
        Statement/Prospectus will comply when filed as to form in all material
        respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities
        Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

             (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
        4.1(f), no representation or warranty is made by iXL with respect to
        statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
        Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied in
        writing by Scient for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

          (g) Board Approval.  The Board of Directors of iXL, by resolutions
     duly adopted and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the
     "iXL Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the
     iXL Merger are fair to and in the best interests of iXL and its
     stockholders and declared the iXL Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved
     this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the iXL Merger, and (iii)
     recommended that the stockholders of iXL adopt this Agreement and directed
     that such matter be submitted for consideration by iXL's stockholders at
     the iXL Stockholders Meeting.

          (h) Anti-Takeover Statutes Not Applicable.  iXL has taken (or caused
     to have been taken) and has done (or caused to have been done) all actions
     and things necessary to make this Agreement and the Mergers contemplated
     herein exempt from and not otherwise subject to any "control share
     acquisition," "business combination," "interested stockholder," "fair
     price," "change-in-control," "merger moratorium," "vote sterilization," or
     other state takeover laws of all jurisdictions applicable to iXL and the
     iXL Merger (collectively with Section 203 of the DGCL, "State Takeover
     Laws").

          (i) Vote Required.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
     of the outstanding shares of iXL Common Stock to adopt this Agreement (the
     "Required iXL Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
     of iXL capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and to consummate
     the iXL Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

          (j) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

             (i) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(j) of the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, there are no suits, actions, judgments or proceedings
        (collectively, "Actions") pending or, to the knowledge of iXL,
        threatened, against or affecting iXL or any Subsidiary of iXL or any
        property or asset of iXL or any Subsidiary of iXL which, individually or
        in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material
        Adverse Effect on iXL, nor are there any judgments, decrees,
        injunctions, rules or orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
        outstanding against iXL or any Subsidiary of iXL which, individually or
        in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material
        Adverse Effect on iXL.

             (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL, iXL and
        its Subsidiaries have been issued and hold all permits, licenses,
        franchises, variances, exemptions, waivers, orders and approvals of all
        Governmental Entities which are necessary for the operation of the
        businesses as now being conducted of iXL and its Subsidiaries, taken as
        a whole (the "iXL Permits"), and no suspension or cancellation of any of
        the iXL Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of iXL, threatened. iXL
        and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the iXL
        Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the
        aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
        Effect on iXL. Neither iXL nor its Subsidiaries is in violation of, and
        iXL and its Subsidiaries have not received any notices of violations
        with respect to, any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations of
        any Governmental Entity, except for violations which, individually or in
        the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
        Adverse Effect on iXL.

                                       A-19

          (k) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Except as disclosed in
     Section 4.1(k) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule and for liabilities expressly
     permitted to be incurred in accordance with this Agreement or directly
     incidental to the transactions contemplated by the Mergers, since December
     31, 2000, iXL and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in
     the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and,
     since such date, there has not been:

             (i) any change, circumstance, state of facts or event which,
        individually or in the aggregate, has had, or reasonably could be
        expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on iXL;

             (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or

        securities of, or other ownership interests in, iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries;

             (iii) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding
        security of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries;

             (iv) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries of any indebtedness for borrowed money;

             (v) any creation or other incurrence by iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries of any Lien on any material asset other than in the
        ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

             (vi) any making of any loan, advance or capital contribution to or

        contributions to or investments in its wholly-owned Subsidiaries in the
        ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

             (vii) any transaction or commitment made, or any contract or
        agreement entered into, by iXL or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
        its assets or business (including the acquisition or disposition of any
        assets) or any relinquishment by iXL or any of its Subsidiaries of any
        contract or other right, in either case, material to iXL and its
        Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than transactions and commitments
        in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
        those expressly contemplated by this Agreement;

             (viii) any change in any method of accounting, method of tax

        amendment (except as required by applicable law) of any collective
        bargaining, bonus, profit-sharing, thrift, pension, retirement, deferred
        compensation, compensation, stock option, restricted stock or other
        benefit plan or arrangement covering any director, officer or employee
        of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries; or

             (x) any material Tax election made or changed, any annual tax
        accounting period changed, any method of tax accounting adopted or
        changed, any material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax
        refunds filed, any material closing agreement entered into, any material
        Tax claim, Audit or assessment settled, or any right to claim a material
        Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability surrendered.

          (l) Intellectual Property.  Except as would not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
     iXL: (i) iXL and/or each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is

                                       A-20

     licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all
     Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its business
     as currently conducted; (ii) to the knowledge of iXL, the use of any
     Intellectual Property by iXL and/or its Subsidiaries does not infringe on
     or otherwise violate the rights of any Person, (iii) the use of the
     Intellectual Property is in accordance with subsisting and enforceable
     licenses pursuant to which iXL or any Subsidiary acquired the right to use
     any Intellectual Property; and (iv) to the knowledge of iXL, no Person is
     challenging, infringing or otherwise violating any right of iXL or any of
     its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or
     licensed to iXL or its Subsidiaries. At the date of this Agreement, except
     as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
     have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL, neither iXL nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has knowledge of any pending claim, order or proceeding with
     respect to any Intellectual Property used by iXL and its Subsidiaries and
     to its knowledge no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by iXL or
     its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would
     reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
     unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

          None of the Intellectual Property or other know-how relating to the
     business of iXL and/or its Subsidiaries, the value of which to iXL is
     contingent upon maintenance of the confidentiality thereof has been
     disclosed by iXL or any of its Affiliates to any Person other than those
     Persons who are bound to hold such information in confidence pursuant to
     confidentiality agreements or by operation of law, except insofar as such
     disclosures would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL. Neither iXL nor any of
     its Subsidiaries are party to any contract that restricts or otherwise
     limits the ability of iXL or such Subsidiary to perform services for any
     other Person. To the knowledge of iXL, each employee of iXL and its
     Subsidiaries is a party to an agreement substantially similar to the "iXL
     Employee Nonsolicitation and Confidentiality Agreement" made available to
     Scient prior to the date hereof.

          (m) Brokers or Finders.  Other than First Union Securities, Inc., and
     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, iXL's financial advisors, no agent,
     broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person is or
     will be entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any other similar
     commission or fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of iXL.

          (n) Opinion of iXL Financial Advisor.  iXL's Board of Directors has
     received the opinion of First Union Securities, Inc. dated the date of this
     Agreement, to the effect that, at such date, the iXL Exchange Ratio is
     fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of iXL Common Stock. A
     copy of such opinion will be made available to Scient promptly after the
     date of this Agreement, and such opinion has not been modified or
     withdrawn.

          (o) Taxes.  Each of iXL and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns
     required to have been filed (or extensions have been duly obtained) and has
     paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it (or has established in
     accordance with GAAP an adequate accrual for all material Taxes through the
     end of the last period for when iXL and its Subsidiaries ordinarily record
     items on their respective books), except where failure to file such Tax
     Returns or pay such Taxes would not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL. All such
     Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true and complete in all
     material respects. No Audit is pending or threatened with respect to any
     Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from, iXL or any of its Subsidiaries.
     There is no current deficiency or adjustment for any Taxes proposed,
     asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There
     are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for current Taxes not yet due
     and those being contested in good faith. Neither iXL nor any of its
     Subsidiaries owns an interest in real property in any jurisdiction in which
     a Tax is imposed, or the value of the interest is reassessed, on the
     transfer of an interest in real property and which treats the transfer of
     an interest in an entity that owns an interest in real property as a
     transfer of the interest in real property. Neither iXL nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably
     likely to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as reorganizations within the
     meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                                       A-21

          (p) Material Contracts.

             (i) Except for the contracts, leases, licenses, commitments, and
        other instruments (collectively, the "iXL Contracts") specifically
        disclosed in the iXL SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of
        this Agreement, or as disclosed at Section 4.1(p) on the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither iXL nor any of its Subsidiaries
        is a party to or bound by: (I) any partnership, joint venture or other
        similar agreement or arrangement (other than any such agreement or
        arrangement disclosed in Section 4.1(d) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule)
        that, if the transactions contemplated thereby were consummated, would
        result in iXL or any of its Subsidiaries being a partner, member or
        equity owner or participant of or in any partnership, joint venture, or
        similar entity or result in an iXL Minority Interest; (II) any agreement
        relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or the deferred purchase
        price of property (in either case whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed
        or secured by an asset); or (III) any agreement containing any provision
        or covenant limiting in any respect the ability of iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of iXL or Holdco, Scient or any successor
        of iXL after the Effective Time to compete in any manner (with respect
        to the businesses conducted on the date hereof and intended to be
        conducted after the Effective Time by the parties hereto) with any
        Person in any geographic area.

             (ii) Each iXL Contract specifically disclosed in any iXL SEC Report
        or required to be disclosed pursuant to this Section 4.1(p) is valid and
        in full force and effect, except to the extent they have previously
        expired in accordance with their terms or the failure to so be in full
        force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
        be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL. Neither iXL nor
        any of its Subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or committed or
        failed to perform any act which with or without notice, lapse of time or
        both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any such
        contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults which,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
        result in a Material Adverse Effect on iXL.

          (q) Employee Benefits.

             (i) Prior to the date hereof, iXL has made available to Scient each
        "employee benefit plan", as defined in ERISA, and each plan or other
        arrangement (written or oral) (including employment and severance
        agreements) providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock
        option or other equity-related rights or other forms of incentive or
        deferred compensation, employee loans, vacation benefits, insurance
        coverage (including any self-insured arrangements), health, medical,
        dental or vision benefits, disability benefits, workers' compensation,
        supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
        post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
        health, medical, or life insurance benefits), in each case which is
        maintained, administered, or contributed to by iXL or any ERISA
        Affiliate thereof and covers any employee, director or independent
        contractor or former employee, director or independent contractor of iXL
        or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or under which iXL or any ERISA Affiliate
        thereof has any liability with respect to current or former employees,
        directors or independent contractors of iXL or any ERISA Affiliate
        thereof. Copies of such plans or other arrangements (and, if applicable,
        related trust agreements) and all amendments thereto and written
        interpretations thereof have been made available to Scient prior to the
        date hereof together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500
        Annual Report including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) prepared in
        connection with any such plan or other arrangement. Such plans or other
        arrangements are referred to collectively as the "iXL Benefit Plans";
        provided that a plan or other arrangement with respect to a former
        employee, director or independent contractor shall constitute an "iXL
        Benefit Plan" only to the extent that iXL or its ERISA Affiliate has any
        present or future liability or obligation. An "ERISA Affiliate" of any
        person means any other person which, together with such person, would be
        treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code. At no time
        has iXL or any person who from time to time is or was an ERISA Affiliate
        of iXL ever maintained an employee benefit plan that is subject to Title
        IV of ERISA. Section 4.1(q) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule lists each
        material iXL Benefit Plan.

                                       A-22

             (ii) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL, each of
        the iXL Benefit Plans, and the administration thereof, is, and has been,
        in compliance with the requirements provided by any and all applicable
        statutes, orders or governmental rules or regulations currently in
        effect, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. Each iXL
        Benefit Plan and its related trust which is intended to qualify under
        Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code is so qualified, and
        nothing has occurred to cause the loss of such qualification. iXL has
        made available to Scient copies of the most recent Internal Revenue
        Service determination letters with respect to each such iXL Benefit
        Plan, if any. Each iXL Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt under
        Section 501(c)(9) or 501(c)(17) of the Code satisfies the requirements
        for such exemption, so qualifies in form and in operation, and meets, or
        has satisfied, the requirements of Section 505(c) of the Code and the
        regulations thereunder.

             (iii) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(q) of the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, with respect to each iXL Benefit Plan, there are no funded
        benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or
        properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations which
        have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted
        in accordance with GAAP, on the iXL SEC Reports, which obligations are
        reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
        Adverse Effect on iXL.

             (iv) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL, with
        respect to each iXL Benefit Plan (A) no prohibited transactions as
        defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code have
        occurred or are expected to occur as a result of the transactions
        contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) no action, suit, grievance,
        arbitration or other manner of litigation, or claim with respect to the
        assets thereof of any iXL Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
        benefits made in the ordinary course of plan administration for which
        plan administrative review procedures have not been exhausted) is
        pending, threatened or imminent against or with respect to any of the
        iXL Benefit Plans, iXL, any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary, as such
        term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA ("Fiduciary"), including but
        not limited to any action, suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner
        of litigation, or claim regarding conduct that allegedly interferes with
        the attainment of rights under any iXL Benefit Plans. Except as would
        not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
        Material Adverse Effect on iXL, none of iXL or its directors, officers,
        or employees, or any Fiduciary has any liability for failure to comply
        with ERISA or the Code for any action or failure to act in connection
        with the administration or investment of such plans.

             (v) No iXL Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning
        of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

             (vi) iXL and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all federal,
        state, local and foreign requirements regarding employment, except for
        any failures to comply that are not reasonably likely, individually or
        in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL. As of the
        date of this Agreement, there is no labor dispute, strike or work
        stoppage against iXL or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
        knowledge of iXL, threatened which may interfere with the business
        activities of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries, except where such dispute,
        strike or work stoppage is not reasonably likely, individually or in the
        aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on iXL.

             (vii) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(q) of the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, no employee of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries will become
        entitled to any change-in-control, retirement, severance, retention or
        similar benefit or enhanced or accelerated benefit or any forgiveness of
        an outstanding advance or loan as a result of the transactions
        contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of
        such transactions in conjunction with any other event). Without limiting
        the generality of the foregoing, no amount required to be paid or
        payable to or with respect to any employee of iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
        (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
        in conjunction with any other

                                       A-23

        event) will, to the knowledge of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries, be an
        "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
        Code.

             (viii) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
        announcement (whether or not written) by iXL or any of its ERISA
        Affiliates relating to, or change in participation or coverage under,
        any iXL Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
        maintaining such iXL Benefit Plan above the level of the expense
        incurred in respect thereof for the twelve months ended on June 30,
        2001.

          (r) Insurance.  All material fire, property and casualty, general
     liability, errors and omissions, business interruption, product liability,
     and sprinkler and water damage insurance policies maintained by iXL or any
     of its Subsidiaries are with reputable insurance carriers, provide full and
     adequate coverage for all normal risks incident to the businesses of iXL
     and its Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets, and are in
     character and amount at least equivalent to that carried by persons engaged
     in similar businesses and subject to the same or similar perils or hazards,
     except for any such failures to maintain insurance policies that,
     individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
     on iXL. iXL and each of its Subsidiaries have made any and all payments
     required to maintain such policies in full force and effect. Except as set
     forth in Section 4.1(r) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule, neither iXL nor any
     of its Subsidiaries has received notice of default under any such policy,
     and has not received written notice, or, to the knowledge of iXL, oral
     notice of any pending or threatened termination or cancellation, denial of
     coverage or limitation or reduction of coverage or material premium
     increase with respect to such policy.

          (s) Transactions with Related Persons.

             (i) Section 4.1(s) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
        of all agreements in effect with Related Persons and not required to be
        disclosed in the iXL SEC Reports pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
        Except as set forth in Section 4.1(s) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule or
        the iXL SEC Reports, since December 31, 2000, neither iXL nor any of its
        Subsidiaries has (I) purchased, leased or otherwise acquired any
        material property or assets or obtained any material services from, (II)
        sold, leased or otherwise disposed of any material property or assets or
        provided any material services to (except with respect to remuneration
        for services rendered in the ordinary course of business as director,
        officer or employee of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries), (III) entered
        into or modified in any manner any contract or other agreement with, or
        (IV) borrowed any money from, or made or forgiven any loan or other
        advance (other than expenses or similar advances made in the ordinary
        course of business) to, any officer, director, or Affiliate
        (collectively, "iXL Related Persons"). Prior to the date hereof, iXL has
        made available to Scient true and complete copies of each contract,
        arrangement and understanding between iXL or any of its Subsidiaries, on
        the one hand, and any iXL Related Person, on the other.

             (ii) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(s) of the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, (x) the contracts of iXL and its Subsidiaries do not include
        any material obligation or commitment between iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries and any iXL Related Person, (y) the assets of iXL or any of
        its Subsidiaries do not include any receivable or other obligation or
        commitment from an iXL Related Person to iXL or any of its Subsidiaries,
        and (z) the liabilities of iXL and its Subsidiaries do not include any
        payable or other obligation or commitment from iXL or any of its
        Subsidiaries to any iXL Related Person.

             (iii) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(s) of the iXL Disclosure
        Schedule, no iXL Related Person is a party to any contract with any
        customer or supplier of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries that affects in
        any material manner the business, financial condition or results of
        operation of iXL or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (t) Leased Properties iXL Does Not Own a Fee Interest in Any Real
     Property.  Section 4.1(t) of the iXL Disclosure Schedule correctly
     describes all real property which iXL leases as a tenant, subleases
     (whether as sublandlord or subtenant), or otherwise occupies ("iXL Leased
     Properties"). iXL has a valid leasehold interest in all iXL Leased
     Properties.

                                       A-24

     4.2. Representations and Warranties of Scient.  Except as disclosed in the
Scient Filed SEC Reports or as set forth in the Scient Disclosure Schedule
delivered by Scient to iXL prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Scient
Disclosure Schedule"), Scient represents and warrants to iXL as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

             (i) Each of Scient and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
        organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
        the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
        requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
        and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
        failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have
        such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, does not
        have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
        Effect on Scient, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do
        business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
        ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
        necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to
        qualify or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
        does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material
        Adverse Effect on Scient. The copies of the certificate of incorporation
        and bylaws of Scient and its Subsidiaries which were previously
        furnished or made available to iXL are true, complete and correct copies
        of such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

             (ii) Exhibit 21.1 to Scient's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
        year ended March 31, 2001, includes all the Subsidiaries of Scient which
        as of the date of this Agreement are Significant Subsidiaries. All the
        outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity and ownership
        interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued
        and are fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth in such
        Exhibit 21.1, are owned directly or indirectly by Scient, free and clear
        of all Liens and free of all restrictions (including restrictions on the
        right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
        ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable U.S.
        Federal securities laws.

          (b) Capital Structure.

             (i) The authorized capital stock of Scient consists of (a)
        500,000,000 shares of Scient Common Stock, of which 74,345,915 shares
        are outstanding on July 26, 2001, and (B) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred
        Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of which (1) 100,000 shares have
        been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, of which
        no shares are outstanding. All issued and outstanding shares of the
        capital stock of Scient have been duly authorized and are validly
        issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights. At
        the date hereof, there are no options, warrants or other rights to
        acquire any shares of capital stock from Scient other than the Scient
        Stock Options representing in the aggregate the right to purchase
        9,932,261 shares of Scient Common Stock pursuant to the Scient Stock
        Plans on June 30, 2001.

             (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Scient
        having the right to vote on any matters on which holders of capital
        stock of Scient may vote ("Scient Voting Debt") are issued or
        outstanding.

             (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 4.2(b) or in
        Section 4.2(b) of the Scient Disclosure Schedule, there are no
        securities, options, warrants, calls, puts, rights, commitments,
        agreements, plans, contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind
        to which Scient or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
        them is bound obligating Scient or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
        deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
        shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Scient or any of
        its Subsidiaries or obligating Scient or any of its Subsidiaries to
        issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant,
        call, put, right, commitment, agreement, plan, contract, arrangement or
        undertaking. Except as disclosed in Section 4.2(b) of the Scient
        Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding obligations of Scient or
        any of its Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
        shares of capital stock of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries.

                                       A-25

          (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

             (i) Scient has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
        into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
        hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the Scient Merger to
        the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Scient Vote. The
        execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by Scient
        of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
        necessary corporate action on the part of Scient and no other corporate
        proceedings on the part of Scient are necessary to authorize the
        execution and delivery by Scient of this Agreement or to consummate the
        Scient Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, subject in
        the case of the consummation of the Scient Merger to the adoption of
        this Agreement by the Required Scient Vote. This Agreement has been duly
        executed and delivered by Scient and constitutes the valid and binding
        agreement of Scient, enforceable against Scient in accordance with its
        terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
        insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
        affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles
        (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
        in equity or at law).

             (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Scient do not,
        and the consummation by Scient of the Scient Merger and the other
        transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with or result in a
        Violation pursuant to: (A) any provision of the certificate of
        incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational document of Scient or
        any Significant Subsidiary of Scient, or (B) except as set forth in
        Section 4.2(c) of the Scient Disclosure Schedule and, except with
        respect to employee stock options and other awards, or (1) as,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
        have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient, or (2) would not prevent or
        materially delay the consummation of the Mergers, subject to obtaining
        or making the consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations,
        registrations, declarations and filings referred to in clause (iii) of
        this Section 4.2(c), any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond,
        indenture, deed, lease, benefit plan, or any other agreement,
        obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license,
        judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
        applicable to Scient or any Subsidiary of Scient or their respective
        properties or assets.

             (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
        registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any
        other Person is required by or with respect to Scient or any Subsidiary
        of Scient in connection with the execution and delivery of this
        Agreement by Scient or the consummation by Scient of the Scient Merger
        and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except the Necessary
        Consents and such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
        registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to make or
        obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
        expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient.

          (d) Minority Interests.

             (i) Section 4.2(d) of the Scient Disclosure Schedule lists, as of
        the date hereof, (A) the name of each Person (other than any Person that
        is a Subsidiary of Scient) in which Scient or any of its Subsidiaries
        owns any capital stock or other equity interests (or any securities
        convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or options or other
        rights to acquire, any capital stock or other equity interests in, any
        such Person) (each such Person being hereinafter referred to as a
        "Scient Minority Interest") and (B) the current percentage ownership
        interest and, to the knowledge of Scient, the fully diluted percentage
        ownership interest, in each case of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries
        therein. Except for the Scient Minority Interests, neither Scient nor
        any of its Subsidiaries (1) owns any capital stock or other equity
        interest (or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or
        options or other rights to acquire, any capital stock or other equity
        interest) in any Third Party or (2) is obligated to make any investment
        in any Third Party such that such Third Party would become a Scient
        Minority Interest.

             (ii) Section 4.2(d) of the Scient Disclosure Schedule lists each
        agreement or arrangement (x) between Scient or any of its Subsidiaries,
        on the one hand, and any Scient Minority Interest or
                                       A-26

        any Person that owns any capital stock or other equity interests (or any
        securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or options or other
        rights to acquire, any such capital stock or other equity interests) in
        any Scient Minority Interest, on the other hand, and (y) to which Scient
        or any of its Subsidiaries is a party which (A) has affected or is
        reasonably likely to affect the ability of Holdco to direct and control
        Scient's or its Subsidiaries' interest in a Scient Minority Interest
        after consummation of the Mergers or (B) evidences (1) any commitment
        (whether or not contingent) for future investment of capital or
        otherwise to be directly or indirectly made by Scient or any of its
        Subsidiaries in any Scient Minority Interest or any of its Subsidiaries
        or (2) any other future liabilities or obligations in respect thereof of
        Scient or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (e) Reports and Financial Statements.

             (i) Scient has filed all required registration statements,
        prospectuses, notifications, reports, schedules, forms, statements and
        other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
        2000 (collectively, including all exhibits and schedules thereto, the
        "Scient SEC Reports"). Except as set forth in Section 4.2(e)(i) of the
        Scient Disclosure Schedule, no Subsidiary of Scient is required to file
        any form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document
        with the SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a
        filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each
        Scient SEC Report filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any
        untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
        necessary in order to make the statements made therein, not misleading.
        Each Scient SEC Report that is a registration statement, as amended or
        supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of
        the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
        not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
        material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
        statements therein not misleading. Each of the financial statements
        (including the related notes) included in the Scient SEC Reports
        presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
        position and consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Scient
        and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the
        respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with GAAP
        consistently applied during the periods and at the respective dates
        involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of
        the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and
        normal year-end adjustments that have not been and are not reasonably
        expected to be material in amount. All of such Scient SEC Reports, at
        their respective dates (and at the date of any amendment to the
        respective Scient SEC Report), complied as to form in all material
        respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
        Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

             (ii) Except as disclosed in the Scient SEC Reports filed and
        publicly available prior to the date hereof (the "Scient Filed SEC
        Reports"), Scient and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities
        that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance
        sheet of Scient and its Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared
        in conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred in the
        ordinary course of business, (B) liabilities incurred in accordance with
        Section 5.2, (C) liabilities for Taxes, or (D) liabilities that,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
        have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient.

             (iii) Scient's cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments
        at June 30, 2001 were approximately $115,124,000.

          (f) Information Supplied.

             (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Scient
        for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 will, at
        the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended
        or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
        Act or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
        fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
        necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and
        (B) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first
        mailed to Scient stockholders or iXL stockholders or at the time of the
        Scient Stockholders Meeting or the iXL
                                       A-27

        Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
        omit to state any material fact or necessary in order to make the
        statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
        made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
        Statement/Prospectus will comply when filed as to form in all material
        respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities
        Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

             (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
        4.2(f), no representation or warranty is made by Scient with respect to
        statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
        Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied in
        writing by iXL for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

          (g) Board Approval.  The Board of Directors of Scient, by resolutions
     duly adopted and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the
     "Scient Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
     the Scient Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Scient and its
     stockholders and declared the Scient Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved
     this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, and the Scient Merger, and (iii)
     recommended that the stockholders of Scient adopt this Agreement and
     directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by Scient's
     stockholders at the Scient Stockholders Meeting.

          (h) Anti-Takeover Statutes Not Applicable.  Scient has taken (or
     caused to have been taken) and has done (or caused to have been done) all
     actions and things necessary to make this Agreement and the Mergers
     contemplated herein exempt from and not otherwise subject to any State
     Takeover Laws applicable to Scient and the Scient Merger.

          (i) Vote Required.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
     of the outstanding shares of Scient Common Stock to adopt this Agreement
     (the "Required Scient Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class
     or series of Scient capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and to
     consummate the Scient Merger and the other transactions contemplated
     hereby.

          (j) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

             (i) There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Scient,
        threatened, against or affecting Scient or any Subsidiary of Scient or
        any property or asset of Scient or any Subsidiary of Scient which,
        individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
        Material Adverse Effect on Scient, nor are there any judgments, decrees,
        injunctions, rules or orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
        outstanding against Scient or any Subsidiary of Scient which,
        individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
        Material Adverse Effect on Scient.

             (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient,
        Scient and its Subsidiaries have been issued and hold all permits,
        licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, waivers, orders and
        approvals of all Governmental Entities which are necessary for the
        operation of the businesses as now being conducted of Scient and its
        Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Scient Permits"), and no suspension
        or cancellation of any of the Scient Permits is pending or, to the
        knowledge of Scient, threatened. Scient and its Subsidiaries are in
        compliance with the terms of the Scient Permits, except where the
        failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient.
        Neither Scient nor its Subsidiaries is in violation of, and Scient and
        its Subsidiaries have not received any notices of violations with
        respect to, any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations of any
        Governmental Entity, except for violations which, individually or in the
        aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
        Effect on Scient.

          (k) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Except as disclosed in
     Section 4.2(k) of the Scient Disclosure Schedule and for liabilities
     expressly permitted to be incurred in accordance with this Agreement or
     directly incidental to the transactions contemplated by the Mergers, since
     March 31, 2001,

                                       A-28

     Scient and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the
     ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since
     such date, there has not been:

             (i) any change, circumstance, state of facts or event which,
        individually or in the aggregate, has had, or reasonably could be
        expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Scient;

             (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
        other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of
        Scient, or any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Scient or
        any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding shares of capital stock or
        other securities of, or other ownership interests in, Scient or any of
        its Subsidiaries;

             (iii) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding
        security of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries;

             (iv) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by Scient or any of
        its Subsidiaries of any indebtedness for borrowed money;

             (v) any creation or other incurrence by Scient or any of its
        Subsidiaries of any Lien on any material asset other than in the
        ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

             (vi) any making of any loan, advance or capital contribution to or
        investment in any Person other than loans, advances or capital
        contributions to or investments in its wholly-owned Subsidiaries in the
        ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

             (vii) any transaction or commitment made, or any contract or
        agreement entered into, by Scient or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
        its assets or business (including the acquisition or disposition of any
        assets) or any relinquishment by Scient or any of its Subsidiaries of
        any contract or other right, in either case, material to Scient and its
        Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than transactions and commitments
        in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
        those expressly contemplated by this Agreement;

             (viii) any change in any method of accounting, method of tax
        accounting or accounting principles or practice by Scient or any of its
        Subsidiaries, except for any such change required by reason of a
        concurrent change in GAAP or Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act;

             (ix) any (A) grant of any severance or termination pay to (or
        amendment to any existing arrangement with) any director, officer or
        employee of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) increase in
        compensation, bonus or other benefits payable to any director, officer
        or employee of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in the
        ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, increase in
        benefits payable under any existing severance or termination pay
        policies or employment agreements, (C) entering into any employment,
        deferred compensation or other similar agreement (or any amendment to
        any such existing agreement) with any director, officer or employee of
        Scient or any of its Subsidiaries, or (D) establishment, adoption or
        amendment (except as required by applicable law) of any collective
        bargaining, bonus, profit-sharing, thrift, pension, retirement, deferred
        compensation, compensation, stock option, restricted stock or other
        benefit plan or arrangement covering any director, officer or employee
        of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries; or

             (x) any material Tax election made or changed, any annual tax
        accounting period changed, any method of tax accounting adopted or
        changed, any material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax
        refunds filed, any material closing agreement entered into, any material
        Tax claim, Audit or assessment settled, or any right to claim a material
        Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability surrendered.

          (l) Intellectual Property.  Except as would not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
     Scient: (i) Scient and/or each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
     use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all Intellectual Property
     used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
     conducted; (ii) to the knowledge of Scient, the use of any Intellectual
     Property by Scient and/or its Subsidiaries does not infringe on or
     otherwise violate the rights

                                       A-29

     of any Person, (iii) the use of the Intellectual Property is in accordance
     with subsisting and enforceable licenses pursuant to which Scient or any
     Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property; and (iv) to
     the knowledge of Scient, no Person is challenging, infringing or otherwise
     violating any right of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
     any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to Scient or its
     Subsidiaries. At the date of this Agreement, except as would not reasonably
     be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Scient, neither Scient nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge
     of any pending claim, order or proceeding with respect to any Intellectual
     Property used by Scient and its Subsidiaries and to its knowledge no
     Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Scient or its Subsidiaries
     is being used or enforced in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
     result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
     Intellectual Property.

          None of the Intellectual Property or other know-how relating to the
     business of Scient and/or its Subsidiaries, the value of which to Scient is
     contingent upon maintenance of the confidentiality thereof has been
     disclosed by Scient or any of its Affiliates to any Person other than those
     Persons who are bound to hold such information in confidence pursuant to
     confidentiality agreements or by operation of law, except insofar as such
     disclosures would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient. Neither Scient nor
     any of its Subsidiaries are party to any contract that restricts or
     otherwise limits the ability of Scient or such Subsidiary to perform
     services for any other Person. To the knowledge of Scient, each employee of
     Scient and its Subsidiaries is a party to an agreement substantially
     similar to the "Scient Employee Nonsolicitation and Confidentiality
     Agreement" made available to iXL prior to the date hereof.

          (m) Brokers or Finders.  Other than Thomas Weisel Partners LLC and
     Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporation, no agent, broker, investment banker,
     financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any
     broker's or finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in
     connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Scient.

          (n) Opinion of Scient Financial Advisor.  Scient's Board of Directors
     has received the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners LLC dated the date of
     this Agreement, to the effect that, at such date, the Scient Exchange Ratio
     is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Scient Common
     Stock. A copy of such opinion will be made available to iXL promptly after
     the date of this Agreement, and such opinion has not been modified or
     withdrawn.

          (o) Taxes.  Each of Scient and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax
     Returns required to have been filed (or extensions have been duly obtained)
     and has paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it (or has established
     in accordance with GAAP an adequate accrual for all material Taxes through
     the end of the last period for when Scient and its Subsidiaries ordinarily
     record items on their respective books), except where failure to file such
     Tax Returns or pay such Taxes would not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient. All
     such Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true and complete
     in all material respects. No Audit is pending or threatened with respect to
     any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from, Scient or any of its
     Subsidiaries. There is no current deficiency or adjustment for any Taxes
     proposed, asserted, or assessed against the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries. There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for current
     Taxes not yet due and those being contested in good faith. Neither Scient
     nor any of its Subsidiaries owns an interest in real property in any
     jurisdiction in which a Tax is imposed, or the value of the interest is
     reassessed, on the transfer of an interest in real property and which
     treats the transfer of an interest in an entity that owns an interest in
     real property as a transfer of the interest in real property. Neither
     Scient nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any
     fact that is reasonably likely to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as
     reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (p) Material Contracts.

             (i) Except for the contracts, leases, licenses, commitments, and
        other instruments (collectively, the "Scient Contracts") specifically
        disclosed in the Scient SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date
        of this Agreement, or as disclosed at Section 4.2(p) on the Scient
        Disclosure
                                       A-30

        Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither Scient nor any of its
        Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: (I) any partnership, joint
        venture or other similar agreement or arrangement (other than any such
        agreement or arrangement disclosed in Section 4.2(d) of the Scient
        Disclosure Schedule) that, if the transactions contemplated thereby were
        consummated, would result in iXL or any of its Subsidiaries being a
        partner, member or equity owner or participant of or in any partnership,
        joint venture, or similar entity or result in a Scient Minority
        Interest; (II) any agreement relating to indebtedness for borrowed money
        or the deferred purchase price of property (in either case whether
        incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by an asset); or (III) any
        agreement containing any provision or covenant limiting in any respect
        the ability of Scient or any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of
        Scient or Holdco, iXL or any successor of Scient after the Effective
        Time to compete in any manner (with respect to the businesses conducted
        on the date hereof and intended to be conducted after the Effective Time
        by the parties hereto) with any Person in any geographic area.

             (ii) Each Scient Contract specifically disclosed in any Scient SEC
        Report or required to be disclosed pursuant to this Section 4.2(p) is
        valid and in full force and effect, except to the extent they have
        previously expired in accordance with their terms or the failure to so
        be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not
        reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Scient.
        Neither Scient nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated any provision
        of, or committed or failed to perform any act which with or without
        notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the
        provisions of, any such contract, except in each case for those
        violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would
        not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
        Scient.
