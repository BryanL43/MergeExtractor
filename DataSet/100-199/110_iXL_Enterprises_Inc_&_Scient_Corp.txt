      TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF IXL ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SCIENT CORPORATION

                A MERGER PROPOSAL -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

    iXL and Scient have agreed to combine in a merger of equals. We are
proposing this business combination because we expect a range of synergies to
result from the transaction and implementation of the combined company's
business plan, including a strong competitive platform, cost savings resulting
from consolidation of overhead and technology infrastructure, and an experienced
combined management team. The new corporation, in which former iXL stockholders
and former Scient stockholders will become new stockholders, will be named
Scient, Inc. (and is currently named India-Sierra Holdings, Inc.), and will own
the businesses and assets of iXL and Scient. The initial board of directors of
this new company, which we will refer to as Holdco, will be composed of three
members designated by iXL, three members designated by Scient and two members
who will be independent directors agreed to by iXL and Scient. Management of
Holdco will be comprised of executive officers from both iXL and Scient.

    When the merger is completed, iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock for each share they own and Scient common
stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock for each share they
own. As a result, former stockholders of iXL will hold approximately 50%, and
former stockholders of Scient will hold approximately 50%, of the outstanding
common stock of Holdco. Holdco intends to apply to list its common stock on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the current Scient symbol "SCNT."

    In connection with the merger, iXL and Scient also propose that Holdco adopt
the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to enable the conversion of certain
outstanding iXL stock options upon the merger and the grant of stock options to
employees and consultants of Holdco after the merger.

    The board of directors of each of iXL and Scient has determined that the
combination of iXL and Scient is advisable and fair to its stockholders, has
unanimously approved the merger and recommends that iXL and Scient stockholders
vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc.
2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Information about the merger and the equity
incentive plan is contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.
Stockholders owning shares representing approximately 34% of the voting power of
each of iXL and Scient have entered into voting agreements pursuant to which
they have agreed to vote their respective shares FOR adoption of the merger
agreement and the equity incentive plan. We urge you to read this document,
including the section describing risk factors that begins on page
[             ].

    The dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

              For iXL stockholders:                              For Scient stockholders:
              iXL Enterprises, Inc.                                 Scient Corporation
               Stockholder Meeting                                 Stockholder Meeting
      [         ], 2001 at [         ] a.m.               [         ], 2001 at [         ] a.m.

    Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as
possible to make sure that your shares are represented at the meeting. If you do
not vote, it will have the same effect as voting AGAINST adoption of the merger
agreement.

    We strongly support this combination of our companies and join with our
boards of directors in enthusiastically recommending that you vote FOR adoption
of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan.

                   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS

Q:   Why are iXL and Scient proposing the merger?

A:   Scient and iXL face significant challenges as a result of changes over the
     past year in the industries in which they operate. We are proposing the
     merger because we expect a range of synergies to result from the proposed
     business combination and implementation of the combined company's business
     plan, including a strong competitive platform, cost savings and economies
     of scale resulting from consolidation of overhead and technology
     infrastructure, and an experienced combined management team. We believe
     that the combined company will be much stronger than either iXL or Scient
     on its own.

Q:   Why are iXL and Scient proposing adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
     Incentive Plan?

A:   We believe that the grant of equity-based awards such as stock options is a
     highly effective way to align the interests of employees, directors and
     consultants of Holdco with those of stockholders and provides a
     cost-effective means of encouraging their contributions to the success of
     Holdco.

Q:   What will I receive in the merger?

A:   Stockholders of iXL and Scient will receive the following in the merger:

     - iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock
       for each share they own; and

     - Scient common stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common
       stock for each share they own.

Q:   What is Holdco?

A:   Holdco is a newly formed Delaware corporation which was organized by iXL
     and Scient to complete the business combination. Upon consummation of the
     merger, Holdco will be named Scient, Inc. and be a publicly traded holding
     company for the current iXL and Scient businesses.

Q:   What does my board of directors recommend?

A:   The board of directors of iXL recommends that its stockholders vote FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
     Equity Incentive Plan. The board of directors of Scient recommends that its
     stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of
     the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

Q:   Who is soliciting my proxy?

A:   iXL's board of directors is soliciting proxies from iXL's stockholders, and
     Scient's board of directors is soliciting proxies from Scient's
     stockholders.

Q:   What stockholder approvals are needed to approve the merger and the merger
     agreement?

A:   For iXL, a vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
     iXL's common stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement is required.

     For Scient, a vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
     of Scient's common stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement is required.

Q:   What stockholder approvals are needed to approve the Scient, Inc. 2001
     Equity Incentive Plan?

A:   For iXL, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by iXL
     stockholders regarding the equity incentive plan is required.

     For Scient, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by
     Scient stockholders regarding the equity incentive plan is required.

Q:   Have any significant stockholders agreed to vote for the proposals?

A:   Yes. Stockholders owning shares representing approximately 34% of the
     voting power of each of iXL and Scient have entered into voting agreements
     pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their respective shares FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive plan.

Q:   What do I need to do now?

A:   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
     joint proxy statement-prospectus, please respond by completing, signing and
     dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid
     envelope so your shares can be counted at the special meeting.

Q:   What if I don't vote?

A:   If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST
     adoption of the merger agreement and will not be counted with respect to
     the adoption of the equity incentive plan. If you respond and do not
     indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote FOR
     adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the equity incentive
     plan. If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same
     effect as a vote AGAINST adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:   Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card?

A:   Just send by mail a written revocation or a later-dated, completed and
     signed proxy card before the special meeting or simply attend the special
     meeting and vote in person. You cannot change your vote by facsimile, the
     Internet or telephone.

Q:   What do I do if my shares are held by my broker in its name?

A:   Your broker will vote your shares for you only if you instruct your broker
     how to vote for you. Your broker should mail information to you that will
     explain how to give it these instructions.

Q:   Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions on
     how to exchange your stock certificates for shares of Holdco common stock.
     Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:   Where will my shares of Holdco common stock be listed?

A:   It is a condition to the merger that the shares of Holdco common stock to
     be issued in the merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
     We intend to list Holdco common stock under the current Scient symbol
     "SCNT."

Q:   When will I receive my shares of Holdco common stock?

A:   After the business combination is completed you will receive 0.25 shares of
     Holdco common stock for each iXL share you own and 0.31 shares of Holdco
     common stock for each Scient share you own, promptly after we receive from
     you a properly completed letter of transmittal together with your stock
     certificates or, if you do not own any physical stock certificates,
     promptly after we receive your properly completed letter of transmittal and
     electronic transfer of your iXL common stock or Scient common stock, as
     applicable.

Q:   How will I know the merger has occurred?

A:   If the merger occurs, iXL and Scient will make a public announcement and
     you will receive notice of such fact by mail.

Q:   Will I receive dividends on my shares of Holdco common stock?

A:   Holdco does not currently intend to pay dividends on its common stock.

Q:   When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:   We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. We expect to
     complete the merger during the late fall of 2001.

Q:   Are there any important risks about the merger transaction that I should be
     aware of?

     to vote on the merger agreement and whether to vote, we encourage you to

     India-Sierra Holdings, Inc., which will be renamed Scient, Inc. upon the
completion of the merger, and which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus as "Holdco," is a newly formed corporation that has not, to
date, conducted any activities other than those incident to its formation, the
matters contemplated by the merger agreement and the preparation of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus. Upon completion of the

merger, iXL and Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. The
business of Holdco will be the combined businesses currently conducted by iXL
and Scient.

                   THE STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 54)

     To accomplish the combination of their businesses, iXL and Scient jointly
formed a new company, Holdco, with two subsidiaries, India Merger Sub, Inc. and
Sierra Merger Sub, Inc. At the time the merger is completed:

     - iXL will be merged into India Merger Sub, and India Merger Sub will be
       the surviving corporation; and

     - Sierra Merger Sub will be merged into Scient, and Scient will be the
       surviving corporation.

     As a result, iXL (through its successor corporation India Merger Sub) and
Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

     The organization of the companies before and after the merger is
illustrated on the following page.

       Incentive Plan will expire in accordance with the plan, provided,
       however, all unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the
       merger; and

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 2000 Stock Plan
       will expire in accordance with the plan, provided, however, that all
       unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the merger.

     Holdco.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the
issuance of stock options to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a
number of shares of Holdco common stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of
Holdco common stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the
merger. A large portion of these options will be granted immediately following
the merger in order to provide important retention incentives for employees and
consultants.

                         TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 56)

     We have structured the merger so that iXL, Scient and their respective
stockholders who exchange their shares for shares of Holdco common stock will
not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in
connection with the merger, except for taxes payable because of cash received by
iXL and Scient stockholders instead of fractional shares.

                 OVERVIEW OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 59)

     Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.  Each of iXL's and Scient's
obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions, including those listed below:

     - the merger agreement must be adopted by both the iXL and Scient
       stockholders;

     - no law, injunction or order preventing the completion of the merger may
       be in effect;

     - any applicable waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws must expire or be
       terminated;

     - the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the merger must have
       been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market;

     - the registration statement in which this joint proxy statement-prospectus
       is contained must be declared effective by the SEC;

     - each of iXL and Scient must have complied with their respective covenants
       in the merger agreement;

     - each of iXL's and Scient's respective representations and warranties in
       the merger agreement must be true and correct; and

     - iXL must receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the merger
       relating to iXL will qualify as a tax-free reorganization, and Scient
       must receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the merger
       relating to Scient will qualify as a tax-free reorganization.

     Termination of the Merger Agreement.  iXL and Scient can jointly agree to
terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either company may also terminate
the merger agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed on or before December 31, 2001; this date may
       be extended to a date no earlier than March 31, 2002, if the registration
       statement in which this joint proxy statement-prospectus is contained has
       not yet been declared effective by the SEC;

     - government actions do not permit the completion of the merger;

     - either company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement
       at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders;

     - the board of directors of the other company withdraws or changes its
       recommendation that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger;

     - the other company violates its obligation to convene a meeting of its
       stockholders to consider the merger; or

     - the other company breaches its representations, warranties or covenants
       in the merger agreement in a material way.

     Termination Fees.  The merger agreement provides that in several
circumstances, iXL or Scient may be required to pay a termination fee to the
other party as described on pages 62 through 63.

     "No Solicitation" Provisions.  The merger agreement contains detailed
provisions prohibiting iXL and Scient from seeking an alternative transaction.
These "no solicitation" provisions prohibit iXL and Scient, as well as their
officers, directors, subsidiaries and representatives, from taking any action to
solicit an acquisition proposal as described on page 60. The merger agreement
does not, however, prohibit either party or its respective board of directors
from considering, and potentially recommending, an unsolicited bona fide written
acquisition proposal from a third party that the board of directors concludes in
good faith is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal as described on
pages 60 through 62.

     Accounting Treatment.  We intend to account for the merger under the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations. iXL will be deemed the
purchaser in the merger for accounting purposes.

     Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger.  We will complete the merger
when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived
in accordance with the merger agreement. The merger will become effective when
we file certificates of merger with the State of Delaware. We expect to complete
the merger during the fall of 2001.

                        VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 66)

     iXL has entered into a voting agreement with certain Scient stockholders
who are parties to the agreement pursuant to which these Scient stockholders
have agreed to vote all their shares of Scient common stock FOR adoption of the
merger agreement and the equity incentive plan. As of the record date, these
stockholders owned shares representing approximately 34% of the voting power of
Scient capital stock entitled to vote at the Scient special meeting.

             SCIENT, INC. 2001 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (SEE PAGE 66)

     The purpose of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is to promote
the long-term success of Holdco and the creation of stockholder value. The plan
will reserve for issuance of stock incentives to employees, directors and
consultants of Holdco a number of shares equal to 25% of the number of Holdco
Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger, as
adjusted each subsequent January 1 to a number of shares not to exceed 25% of
the number of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding on such date. All
employees, directors and consultants of Holdco and its subsidiaries will be
eligible to participate in the plan. The plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and stock units.

                SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

     The following tables present (1) selected historical financial data of iXL,
(2) selected historical financial data of Scient and (3) selected unaudited pro
forma combined financial data of Holdco, which reflects the proposed transaction
and assumes the purchase method of accounting.

     The selected historical financial data of iXL has been derived from the
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of iXL
for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2000 and
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000.

     The selected historical financial data of Scient has been derived from the
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Scient
for each of the years in the four-year period ended March 31, 2001 and the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. The historical information is only a summary,
and you should read it in conjunction with the historical financial statements
and related notes contained in the annual and quarterly reports for iXL and
Scient which have been included in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

     The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been derived
from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus and should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information and related notes. The balance sheet data contained in the selected
unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the merger as if it
occurred as of June 30, 2001. The statement of operations data contained in the
selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the merger
as if it occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. The selected
unaudited pro forma combined financial data is presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the operating results or
financial position that would have actually occurred if the merger had been in
effect on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial position of Holdco. The pro forma adjustments are
based on the information and assumptions available at the time of the printing
of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Although estimates are preliminary,
management does not believe the actual results will differ significantly.

     The following table sets forth certain historical per share data of iXL and
Scient and combined per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving
effect to the merger on a purchase basis of accounting, assuming that 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock are issued in exchange for one share of iXL common
stock in the merger and 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock are issued in
exchange for one share of Scient common stock in the merger. This data should be
read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data, the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial data, and the separate historical
financial statements of iXL and Scient and notes, all of which are included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The pro forma condensed
combined financial data are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
that would have been achieved had the business combination been consummated as
of the beginning of the periods presented and should not be construed as
representative of results for any future period.

(1) iXL began trading on June 3, 1999 and Scient began trading on May 24, 1999.
(2) The stock prices for the third quarter 2001 are as of August 15, 2001.

     On July 30, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public
announcement of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the last
reported sale prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market were $1.00 per share of iXL
common stock and $0.55 per share of Scient common stock. On August [  ], 2001,
the last reported sale prices on Nasdaq were $[  ] per share of iXL common stock
and $[  .  ] per share of Scient common stock.

     Because the exchange ratio is fixed, changes in the market prices of iXL
common stock and Scient common stock will affect the dollar value of the Holdco
common stock to be received by stockholders of iXL and Scient in the merger. iXL
stockholders and Scient stockholders are urged to obtain current market
quotations for iXL common stock and Scient common stock prior to their
respective special meetings.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors
in deciding whether to vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR
adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET PRICES OF YOUR SHARES OF IXL STOCK OR SCIENT STOCK MAY
CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE HOLDCO STOCK YOU RECEIVE TO BE LESS THAN IT WAS AT THE
TIME THE MERGER AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.

     In the merger, all shares of iXL common stock and Scient common stock will
be converted into shares of Holdco common stock. The number of shares of Holdco
common stock to be received for each share of iXL common stock and Scient common
stock, as applicable, was fixed when the merger agreement was signed, and there
will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either iXL common stock
or Scient common stock. Any change in the price of either iXL common stock or
Scient common stock will affect the value iXL stockholders and Scient
stockholders receive in the merger. iXL common stock and Scient common stock
have historically experienced significant volatility, and the value of the
shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger may go up or down as the
market price of iXL common stock or Scient common stock goes up or down. Stock
price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control
of iXL and Scient, including changes in their businesses, operations and
prospects, and general market and economic conditions. Neither iXL nor Scient is
permitted to terminate the merger or resolicit the vote of its stockholders
solely because of changes in the market price of either party's common stock.

     The prices of iXL common stock and Scient common stock just prior to the
effective time of the merger may vary from their prices on the date of this
joint proxy statement-prospectus and their prices on the dates of the special
meetings. Because the date the merger is completed will be later than the dates
of the special meetings, the prices of iXL common stock and Scient common stock
on the dates of the special meetings may not be indicative of their prices on
the date the merger is completed.

DIRECTORS OF IXL AND SCIENT WHO HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADOPT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE HOLDCO EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERESTS
THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OR IN ADDITION TO YOUR INTERESTS AS AN IXL OR SCIENT
STOCKHOLDER.

     A number of directors of iXL and a number of directors of Scient who have
recommended that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and FOR the
adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan have employment,
severance and other benefit arrangements that provide them with interests in the
merger that differ from and are in addition to your interests as iXL and Scient
stockholders. Following completion of the merger, Robert M. Howe, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Scient, will become Chairman of the Board of Holdco,
U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Chairman of the Board of iXL, will become Vice Chairman
of the Board of Holdco, Christopher M. Formant, President and Chief Executive
Officer and a director of iXL will become President and Chief Executive Officer
and a director of Holdco, Stephen A. Mucchetti, President and Chief Operating
Officer and a director of Scient, will become Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer and a director of Holdco, Eric Greenberg, Chairman Emeritus
and a director of Scient, will become a director of Holdco, and Frank K. Bynum,
Jr., a director of iXL, will become a director of Holdco.

     The receipt of compensation or other benefits in the merger, including the
grant of new options under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the
vesting of existing stock options and restricted stock awards or the
continuation of indemnification arrangements for current directors of iXL and
Scient following completion of the merger, may have influenced these directors
in making their recommendation that you vote FOR adoption of the merger
agreement and FOR the adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

             RISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF HOLDCO

HOLDCO MAY FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE OPERATIONS OF IXL AND SCIENT OR
REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Holdco to
realize over a reasonable period of time the anticipated growth opportunities
and synergies from combining the businesses of iXL with the businesses of
Scient. To realize the anticipated benefits of this combination, members of the
management team of Holdco must develop strategies and implement a business plan
that will:

     - effectively and efficiently integrate the operations, policies, and
       procedures of iXL and Scient;

     - effect a significant reduction in the costs of operating and managing the
       combined businesses; and

     - successfully retain and attract key employees of the combined businesses,
       including operating management and key technical personnel, during a
       period of transition and in light of the competitive employment market.

     If members of the management team of Holdco are not able to develop
strategies and implement a business plan that achieves these objectives in the
near future, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized. In
particular, anticipated growth in revenue, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or "EBITDA," and cash flow, may not be realized,
which would have an adverse impact on Holdco and the market price of shares of
Holdco common stock.

HOLDCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT ITS BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY TO THE REDUCTION IN
DEMAND FOR INTERNET CONSULTING SERVICES.

     The demand for Internet consulting services has been declining and is
continuing to do so. The average amount of time and corporate resources invested
to attempt to secure any given project or new client has been extended. It is
likely that demand for Internet consulting services will remain lower than
historical levels for the near future. iXL and Scient have experienced a
significant decline in revenues resulting from this decline in demand for their
services and believe the decline in demand and revenues was primarily due to:

     - a broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients have
       significantly tightened technology budgets;

     - increased competitive pressure from traditional management consulting,
       information technology services and Internet consulting service
       competitors; and

     - a lack of urgency by large companies to immediately fund large Internet
       projects.

     iXL and Scient are each attempting, and Holdco will continue to attempt, to
adapt their businesses and business processes to this evolving environment. If
Holdco fails to make its combined operations more cost effective or to
anticipate and adapt its overall business processes to the evolving marketplace,
its business will suffer a material adverse impact.

HOLDCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE SUFFICIENT COSTS TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.

     In response to diminished demand for Internet consulting services, each of
iXL and Scient has undertaken an extensive cost reduction effort. Further
reductions will occur in connection with the integration of the operations of
iXL and Scient into Holdco, particularly in consolidation of leased office
spaces and of corporate and management personnel.

     To date, the following significant steps have been taken in the course of
iXL's cost reduction efforts:

     - the reduction of iXL's workforce (through layoffs and voluntary
       resignations) to a current level of approximately 1,000 employees as of
       June 30, 2001 (a reduction of approximately 66% since June 30, 2000);

     - the closing of 14 offices and significant downsizing of several other
       office locations; currently iXL has seven principal offices in the
       following metropolitan areas: Atlanta, GA; Richmond, VA; Washington, DC;
       New York, NY; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and London, England; and

     - significant changes in iXL's executive management team effective February
       2001, including the hiring of Christopher M. Formant as iXL's new Chief
       Executive Officer and President.

     To date, the following significant actions have been taken in the course of
Scient's cost reduction efforts:

     - the reduction of Scient's workforce (through layoffs and voluntary
       resignations) to a current level of approximately 500 employees as of
       June 30, 2001 (a reduction of approximately 74% since June 30, 2000); and

     - the closing of 6 offices and significant downsizing of several other
       office locations; currently Scient has offices in the following
       metropolitan areas: New York, NY, Boston, MA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX,
       San Francisco, CA, and London, England, as well as affiliate offices in
       Paris, France, and Tokyo, Japan.

     After the merger, Holdco will be required to further reduce the size of its
workforce for the combined businesses, close more offices and reduce general and
administrative expenses if revenues remain at current levels or further decline,
or are otherwise insufficient in relation to its costs of operations. The
ability to generate revenues will be impaired to the extent operations have been
or will be reduced. In addition, if demand for our services increases in the
future, we may not be able to expand our operations, including hiring additional
employees, to meet this demand in a timely fashion or at all. If we cannot
increase our revenues in future periods, our financial results will be adversely
affected.

     As a result of office closings, each of iXL and Scient continues to pay for
office space that it is not currently using. In addition, Scient has committed
to future space that it does not expect to need under its current business
plans. Certain of these excess obligations, which extend for periods ranging
from 2 to 20 years, are secured by cash security deposits and/or letters of
credit issued under their respective senior credit facilities. These lease
obligations, including the deposits and letters of credit will represent a
significant portion of Holdco's operating expenses on an ongoing basis, and thus
may have a material impact on Holdco's liquidity and capital resources and
ability to borrow funds. Holdco's ability to sublease, assign, or otherwise
divest itself of its surplus office space for at least break-even rent could be
adversely affected by depressed real estate market conditions in the relevant
cities. Holdco's failure to dispose of its surplus office space and to recover
the security deposits and obtain the cancellation of the letters of credit may
have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial
condition.

     Additionally, iXL has received notification from the landlord of its
Atlanta headquarters that such landlord deems iXL to be in default of its lease.

HOLDCO HAS LIMITED CAPITAL AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF ITS
REVENUES DO NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS.

     Holdco's future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many
factors. While iXL and Scient believe Holdco will be able to budget effectively
and contain expenses, like iXL and Scient, Holdco may be less able to accurately
predict revenues.

     Holdco's pro forma cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June
30, 2001 totaled approximately $140.9 million. Holdco believes that existing
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with additional
liquidity or funds that may be available under credit facilities, will be
sufficient to meet anticipated needs for working capital and capital
expenditures for the foreseeable future.

     However, if revenues and operating cash flows do not meet expectations and
Holdco does not have the ability to borrow funds from its bank lenders or such
ability is limited, Holdco may need to raise additional funds, and we cannot be
certain that we will be able to obtain additional capital on commercially
favorable terms or at all. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on
commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to:

     - maintain existing offices or open new offices, in the United States or
       internationally, or create additional global business units;

     - hire, train and retain qualified employees;

     - respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements;
       or

     - pursue acquisition opportunities.

     Our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our operations
and financial condition.

     If Holdco raises additional funds through the issuance of equity,
equity-related or debt securities, such equity securities may have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to those of Holdco's common stock. Furthermore,
because of the expected low trading price of Holdco's common stock, commensurate
with the low trading prices of iXL's and Scient's common stock, the number of
shares of the new equity or equity-related securities that may be required to be
issued may cause Holdco stockholders to experience significant additional
dilution. In addition, the issuance of debt securities would increase Holdco's
total leverage which could further depress the price of Holdco's common stock.
Holdco cannot be certain that additional financing, or funds from asset sales,
would be available on acceptable terms if required. If these additional methods
of financing become necessary and are not available or Holdco is unable to raise
funds from the sale of assets, Holdco may need to dramatically change its
business plan or sell or merge its business.

THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR CLIENTS COULD HARM HOLDCO'S BUSINESS.

     For the three months ended June 30, 2001, approximately 62% of iXL's net
revenue was received from its top ten clients, and two of iXL's clients
comprised more than 23% of its net revenue. For the three months ended June 30,
2001, Scient's five largest clients accounted for approximately 49% of Scient's
net revenues, and two clients individually accounted for over 10% of Scient's
net revenues.

     Holdco expects to continue to derive a significant portion of revenues from
a limited number of clients. To the extent that any significant client uses less
services or terminates its relationship, revenues could decline substantially.
The volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from period
to period, and a significant client in one period may not use our services in a
subsequent period. To maintain existing significant clients, Holdco may need to
perform certain of its services at reduced rates. The loss of one or more major
clients, the failure to attract new clients on a timely basis, or a reduction in
revenue associated with existing or proposed customers would harm Holdco's
business and prospects.

OUR LACK OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CLIENTS MAKES OUR REVENUES DIFFICULT TO
PREDICT.

     iXL and Scient are generally retained on a project-by-project basis, rather
than under long-term contracts. As a result our revenues are difficult to
predict. Because we will budget and incur costs based on our expectations of
future revenues, our failure to anticipate our revenues accurately may seriously
harm our financial condition and results of operations.

     Although our goal is to provide the full range of our services to our
clients, like iXL and Scient, we will frequently be retained to design and
perform only discrete segments of work on an engagement-by-engagement basis.
Similarly, because large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages,
there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages
of a project or that the client will cancel or delay additional planned
projects. iXL's and Scient's existing clients can generally reduce the scope of
or cancel their use of our services without penalty and with little or no
notice. If a client defers, modifies or cancels an engagement or chooses not to
retain us for additional phases of a project, we may not be able to rapidly
redeploy our employees to other active areas of our operations and efficiently
utilize our work force,

which could harm our operating results. Our operating expenses are relatively
fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated
variations in the number or size of pending client projects.

IXL'S AND SCIENT'S LIMITED OPERATING HISTORIES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE
THEIR BUSINESSES.

     iXL's operations commenced in May 1996, and Scient commenced operations in
July 1997. Both companies have engaged in extensive cost elimination efforts
since September 2000. As a result, iXL and Scient have limited operating
histories on which you can base your evaluation of Holdco's business and
prospects. Holdco's business and prospects must be considered in light of the
risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in their early
stages of development. These risks are further amplified by the fact that Holdco
is operating in the new and rapidly evolving strategic Internet services market.
These risks and uncertainties include the following:

     - its business model and strategy have evolved and are continually being
       reviewed;

     - it may not be able to successfully implement its business model and
       strategy;

     - its management has not worked together for very long; and

     - it may not be able to attract and maintain executives and other
       employees.

     Holdco cannot be sure that it will be successful in meeting these
challenges and addressing these risks and uncertainties. If Holdco is unable to
do so, its business will not be successful and the value of your investment in
Holdco will decline.

EACH OF IXL AND SCIENT HAS AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, IS NOT CURRENTLY PROFITABLE
AND MAY INCUR FUTURE LOSSES AND HAS SUFFERED DECLINES IN REVENUES.

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL and Scient had accumulated deficits (or negative
retained earnings) of approximately $570.2 million, and $235.2 million,
respectively. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to required accounting
adjustments, Holdco will have an accumulated deficit of $570.2 million as of
June 30, 2001. Additionally, iXL's and Scient's revenue compositions have
changed substantially from inception. Scient's revenues for the quarter ended
June 30, 2001 declined 58% compared to its revenues for the quarter ended March
31, 2001. iXL's revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 declined
approximately 20% compared to its revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.
In addition, iXL's independent accountants have indicated that there is
substantial doubt about iXL's ability to continue as a going concern as a result
of iXL sustaining losses and negative cash flows from operations since iXL's
inception.

     As a result, Holdco may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in
a reasonable time period, or at all. If Holdco fails to achieve or sustain
profitability, the price of its common stock would likely be negatively
affected. If we attain profitability, our ability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards will be subject to yearly limitations.

FAILURE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS FOR CHANGES IN DEMAND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
FINANCIAL RESULTS.

     Our business requires substantial managerial attention to ensure that our
employees and offices operate at an appropriate level of productivity. Failure
to effectively manage the productivity and work quality of our employees and
offices and the corresponding market demand for our services could seriously
harm our operations and financial condition. For example, each of iXL and Scient
has undertaken an extensive cost reduction effort to reduce overcapacity in
geographic areas and markets where demand for its services did not support its
staffing levels. If we do not attain increases in net revenue levels and
productivity, our business, operating results and financial condition could be
seriously harmed.

     Holdco's personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to
support future operations. To accommodate changing client needs and other
project management requirements, Holdco will need to update, change and maintain
various internal systems to support the business and to hire, train and retain
the appropriate personnel to manage our operations. Holdco will also need to
integrate and improve financial and

management controls, reporting systems and operating systems. Holdco may
encounter difficulties in developing, maintaining, and implementing these and
other systems.

IF HOLDCO FAILS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS GROWTH COULD BE
LIMITED AND ITS COSTS COULD INCREASE.

     Historically, iXL and Scient have experienced significant employee
turnover. Holdco's future success and its ability to generate revenue will
depend in large part upon its ability to attract, train and retain additional
highly skilled executive-level management and creative, technical, consulting
and sales personnel. Holdco may not be able to retain qualified existing
employees or hire appropriate new personnel because:

     - competition for skilled personnel in the Internet consulting industry is
       intense;

     - the turnover rate in the Internet consulting industry is high;

     - recent restructurings by iXL and Scient and the associated reductions in
       work force size are viewed unfavorably; and

     - many iXL and Scient employees hold options with exercise prices above the
       current market price of iXL and Scient common stock and, therefore, these
       options do not represent an economic inducement for retention.

HOLDCO WILL DEPEND ON ITS KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL FOR ITS FUTURE SUCCESS.

     Holdco's success will depend largely on the skills of its key management
personnel. The loss of one or more of its key management personnel may
materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations.
Currently, its key management personnel are Robert M. Howe, Chairman of the
Board, U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Board, Christopher M.
Formant, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen A. Mucchetti,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Holdco cannot guarantee
that it will be able to replace any of these individuals in the event their
services become unavailable. In addition, if any of these key employees joins a
competitor or forms a competing company, some of our clients might choose to use
the services of that competitor or new company instead of our own.

HOLDCO'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IMPORTANT TO ITS
BUSINESS.

     Holdco cannot guarantee that the steps that have been taken to protect our
proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our
intellectual property. In addition, Holdco may not be able to detect
unauthorized use of its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to
enforce its rights. If third parties infringe or misappropriate Holdco's trade
secrets, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, its business
could be seriously harmed. In addition, protection of intellectual property in
many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the United States, so
as Holdco's business continues to expand into foreign countries, risks
associated with protecting intellectual property will increase.

     In addition, although Holdco believes that its proprietary rights do not
infringe the intellectual property rights of others, other parties may assert
infringement claims against Holdco or claim that it has violated their
intellectual property rights. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to
cover, or may exclude such claims. Such claims, even if not true, could result
in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management.

HOLDCO'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISK.

     iXL and Scient have limited experience in managing foreign offices and
limited experience in marketing services to clients operating in foreign
markets. They have generated only limited revenues from international
operations. There are risks inherent in conducting business on a global level,
including:

     - the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

     - potentially adverse tax consequences;

     - longer payment cycles than those in the United States;

     - local laws or regulations that may impact our operating results or
       financial condition, such as maximum working hour requirements, overtime
       laws or other labor or employment restrictions;

     - restrictions on the import and export of certain sensitive technologies,
       including data security and encryption technologies that we may use or
       other local laws or regulations impacting ecommerce, such as privacy and
       data exchange laws;

     - seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world,
       such as during the summer months in Europe;

     - changes in regulatory requirements which could raise the cost of doing
       business or even prevent doing business, or restrict the ability to
       remove funds or investments from a country;

     - changes in currency exchange rates, which could significantly decrease
       the profitability of operations where payment is in local currency;

     - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

     - difficulties in using equity incentives for employees, which we rely on
       but which are often less understood outside the United States; and

     - differences in business customs.

     We may be unable to continue to successfully market, sell, deliver and
support our services internationally. For example, iXL and Scient have closed
numerous international offices as part of recent restructurings because they
were unable to generate any significant revenues from such offices. If Holdco is
unable to conduct international operations successfully, its business, financial
condition and operating results could be seriously harmed.

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK.

     Most of iXL's and Scient's client engagements are performed on a
time-and-materials basis, rather than a fixed-price basis. However, from time to
time certain clients demand fixed-price arrangements. Fixed-price contracts
involve greater financial risk than time-and-materials engagements. iXL and
Scient have limited experience estimating costs for fixed-price engagements. If
Holdco fails to estimate costs on fixed-price contracts accurately or encounters
unexpected problems, its financial performance will be adversely affected. iXL
and Scient have in the past had to commit unanticipated resources to complete
some of their fixed-price projects, resulting in lower gross margins. Holdco may
experience similar situations in the future.

SOME CLIENTS DEMAND THAT WE AGREE NOT TO PERFORM SERVICES FOR THEIR COMPETITORS.

     iXL and Scient each have entered into certain contracts wherein they have
agreed not to perform services for competitors of their clients for limited
periods of time. These non-compete agreements reduce the number of our
prospective clients and the number of potential sources of revenue. In addition,
these agreements increase the significance of our client selection process
because many clients compete in markets where only a limited number of players
gain meaningful market share. If we agree not to perform services for a
particular client's competitors and our client fails to capture a significant
portion of its market, we are unlikely to receive future revenues in that
particular market.

HOLDCO MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL CLAIMS FOR DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SOLUTIONS
IT DEVELOPS.

     Many of the solutions Holdco develops are critical to the operations of its
clients' businesses. Any defects or errors in these solutions could result in,
among other things, the following:

     - the payment of a lesser amount of fees than that accrued in the course of
       a particular engagement;

     - delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reactions;

     - negative publicity;

     - additional expenditures to correct the problem; and

     - claims against Holdco.

     iXL's and Scient's standard contracts limit their damages arising from
negligent conduct in rendering services. We believe these limitations on damages
are enforceable but may be subject to a challenge in litigation and, if such a
challenge is successful, may not protect us from liability for damages. In
addition, large claims may not be adequately covered by insurance and may raise
our insurance costs.

OUR CLIENTS MAY BECOME UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY US IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR
SERVICES PERFORMED.

     We assume a certain level of credit risk with our clients in order to do
business. Conditions affecting any of our clients could cause them to become
unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for services we
have already provided them. In the past iXL and Scient have experienced
significant collection delays from certain clients, and we cannot predict
whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays. Where it
is not probable that a customer will be able to pay, as determined at the onset
of an engagement, revenue is not recognized under iXL and Scient revenue
recognition policies for these customers until cash is collected. However, in
certain circumstances where the customer's ability to pay has been determined to
be probable at the onset of the engagement but the customer's financial
condition has subsequently deteriorated, iXL and Scient may be unable to realize
payment for their services on a timely basis. In particular, as our client base
has shifted to larger enterprise clients with longer billing cycle times and/or
unpredictable budget processes, our collections cycle time, and problems in
collecting invoiced amounts have increased and may continue to increase in the
future. If one or more of our clients fails or refuses to pay us in a timely
manner or at all, or if we are unable to collect a number of large accounts
receivable, it could have a material adverse effect on Holdco's business,
operating results and financial condition.

     Some of our current and potential clients, particularly those clients
funded primarily by venture capital, need to raise additional funds in order to
continue their business and operations as planned. We cannot be certain that
these companies will be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms
or at all. As a result of an inability to raise necessary financing, some
clients may be unable to retain our services or to pay us for services we have
already provided them or they may terminate our services earlier than we expect,
any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and
operating results. In particular, some of our current and potential clients
funded by venture capital have recently encountered greater difficulty obtaining
needed financing and therefore have had difficulty in retaining our services and
in paying amounts owed for services provided.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP BRAND AWARENESS OF OUR SERVICES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

     An important element of our business strategy is to develop and maintain
widespread awareness of the Scient brand name on a global basis. Our brand may
be closely associated with the business success or failure of some of our
high-profile clients, many of whom are pursuing unproven business models in
competitive markets. As a result, the failure or difficulties of one of our
high-profile clients may damage our brand. Specifically, as disclosed above, our
business reputation has been negatively impacted by certain failures or problems
experienced by some of our clients in the recent past, whether or not these
failures, problems, or setbacks were caused by our work or were within our
control. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand name or incur
significant related expenses, our operating margins and growth may be impacted
adversely.

A FEW STOCKHOLDERS WILL OWN MUCH OF HOLDCO'S STOCK.

     Holdco's directors, executive officers and their affiliates will
beneficially own a significant minority of Holdco outstanding common stock. As a
result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant control over all
matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant

corporate transactions, such as acquisitions, and to block an unsolicited tender
offer. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of
delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium
over the then-current market price of our common stock.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF A MARKET FOR OUR SERVICES.

     We cannot be certain that a viable market for our services will be
sustainable. The broad economic slowdown has caused many of our customers and
potential customers to significantly reduce their technology spending and our
clients to stop or delay the use of our services. If a viable and sustainable
market for our services does not develop and/or if we do not accurately predict
trends in the market and respond to those trends by providing new services or
products, we may fail. Even if we develop new services or products, there can be
no guarantee that a market will exist for such services and products or that
such services and products will adequately respond to market trends. If we
invest resources to develop new services and products for which a market does
not develop, our business and operating results would be seriously harmed. Even
if the market for our services grows, it may not grow at an adequate pace, and
we may not be able to differentiate our services from those of our competitors.
If we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors,
our revenues and operating margins may decline.

  RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKETS AND OWNERSHIP OF HOLDCO COMMON STOCK

YOU MAY ENCOUNTER VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PRICE FOR HOLDCO'S COMMON STOCK.

     The trading price of iXL's and Scient's common stock has been, and it is
likely that the trading price of Holdco common stock will continue to be, highly
volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among others, factors
such as the following:

     - actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;

     - the addition or loss of affiliates or providers;

     - ability to hire and retain employees;

     - additions or departures of key personnel;

     - announcements of technological innovations, new products or services by
       Holdco or its competitors;

     - changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

     - conditions or trends in the Internet and online commerce industries;

     - changes in the market valuations of other Internet or online service
       companies;

     - announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
       ventures or capital commitments;

     - sales of Holdco common stock;

     - general market conditions; and

     - other events or factors, many of which are beyond Holdco's control.

     In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the market for Internet and technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad
market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect Holdco's stock
price, regardless of its operating performance. Further, the existing market for
its common stock may not be sustained. In such circumstances, it may be
difficult for shareholders to sell shares of its common stock at a price that is
attractive.

     The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the issuance
of stock options to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a number of
shares of Holdco common stock equal to 25% of the number

of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding immediately after the effective
time of the merger, as adjusted each subsequent January 1 to a number of shares
not to exceed 25% of the number of shares of Holdco common stock outstanding on
such date. As described in the section of this joint proxy statement-prospectus
which describes the plan, a large portion of these options will be granted
immediately following the merger in order to provide important retention
incentives for employees. This large number of options could have a significant
effect on the market price of Holdco stock and cause dilution to the earnings
per share of Holdco common stock.

POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS MAKE FINANCIAL FORECASTING
DIFFICULT AND COULD AFFECT THE TRADING PRICES OF HOLDCO'S COMMON STOCK.

     As a result of ongoing cost reduction programs, limited operating
histories, the fluctuations in demand for Internet consulting services, rapid
historical growth, numerous historical acquisitions and the emerging nature of
the markets in which iXL and Scient compete and Holdco will compete, iXL, Scient
and Holdco believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations
for preceding quarters are not necessarily meaningful. Also, it is difficult to
forecast quarterly results due to, among other things, the difficulty in
predicting the amount and timing of client expenditures, acquisitions and
employee utilization. iXL's, Scient's and Holdco's quarterly results of
operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of
factors, many of which are outside their control, including:

     - ability to obtain new and follow-on client engagements;

     - failure or delay by clients in paying invoiced fees and expenses;

     - ability to retain clients on a long-term basis;

     - the amount and timing of expenditures by clients on a global basis for
       Internet consulting services and variations in budget cycles of large
       enterprise clients;

     - costs related to the closing, opening, shrinking or expanding of branch
       offices;

     - employee utilization rates, including the ability to transition employees
       quickly from completed projects to new engagements;

     - changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;

     - ability to attract, train and retain skilled management, strategic,
       technical, design, sales, marketing and support professionals;

     - the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;
       and

     - ability to manage costs, including personnel costs and support services
       costs.

     You should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of
its future performance. When iXL, Scient, Holdco or their respective authorized
executives make forecasts or comments about anticipated or intended future
results, those statements are subject to, among other things, risks and
uncertainties noted in this paragraph and discussed in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

WE ARE AT RISK OF SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION DUE TO OUR EXPECTED STOCK
PRICE VOLATILITY.

     In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against companies, including iXL, following periods of volatility in the market
price of their securities. Please see the section entitled "iXL
Business -- Legal Proceedings" on page 81 of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus for a description of such litigation against iXL. Due to
the historical and projected volatility of the stock prices of iXL, Scient and
Holdco, we may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities
litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention
and resources, which could seriously harm our financial condition and operating
results.

OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LOSE ELIGIBILITY FOR TRADING ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET.

     Due to the recent downturn for Internet consultants, the bid price for
iXL's and Scient's common stock has declined substantially. On August 9, 2001,
Scient received a notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market that its common stock has
failed to maintain the requisite minimum bid price over a specified period as
required for continued listing on Nasdaq; Scient was provided with 90 calendar
days to regain compliance with this requirement or be delisted from trading. If
after the merger Holdco's common stock were to experience a similar decline in
its bid price, it is possible that in the future Holdco might lose its
eligibility under various tests for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Upon
such a loss of eligibility, it is likely that trading activity would decline
substantially, further depressing the trading price.

               RISKS RELATED TO THE INTERNET CONSULTING INDUSTRY

THE DEVELOPING MARKET FOR INTERNET CONSULTING SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF
ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERNET AS A BUSINESS MEDIUM WILL AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

     The market for Internet consulting services is relatively new and is
evolving rapidly. Future growth is dependent upon our ability to provide
Internet consulting services that are accepted by our existing and future
clients as an integral part of their business model. Demand and market
acceptance for recently introduced services are subject to a high level of
uncertainty. The level of demand and acceptance of strategic Internet services
is dependent upon a number of factors, including, among other things, the
following:

     - the growth in consumer access to and acceptance of new interactive
       technologies such as the Internet;

     - companies adopting Internet-based business models; and

     - the development of technologies that facilitate two-way communication
       between companies and targeted audiences.

     Significant issues concerning the commercial use of these technologies
include security, reliability, cost, ease of use and quality of service. These
issues remain unresolved and may inhibit the growth of Internet business
solutions that utilize these technologies. If the market for strategic Internet
services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, or if our
services do not achieve market acceptance, our business will not succeed and the
value of your investment in our common stock will decline.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE CONTINUOUS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN OUR
MARKET.

     Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to
technological advances. We may not be successful in responding quickly,
cost-effectively and sufficiently to these developments. If we are unable, for
technical, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner in response
to technological advances, we will not be able to compete effectively. In
addition, employee time allocated to responding to technological advances will
not be available for client engagements.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH RELATIVELY LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY.

     The market for our solutions and services is highly competitive and has
become more so with the general market decline in demand for our services. It is
also characterized by a growing number of companies that have introduced or
developed similar offerings. Our target market is rapidly evolving and is
subject to continuous technological changes. Additionally, there are relatively
low barriers of entry into our business. We currently have limited patented or
other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from
entering the Internet consulting market. As a result, our competitors may be
better positioned to address these developments and may react more favorably to
these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Existing and future competitors
may develop or offer solutions and services that provide significant
technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the
services we offer.

     We classify our competitors into several groups:

     - e-business solution providers;

     - strategic consulting firms;

     - large information technology consulting services providers; and

     - computer hardware and service vendors.

     Our primary competitors today are Sapient Corporation, Proxicom, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Dimension Data), Viant Corp., and smaller professional services
firms. In addition, the "Big Five" consulting firms as well as other large and
small services firms are now more involved in the Internet consulting services
arena. We also compete with professional services groups of computer equipment
companies such as IBM; outsourcing firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation
and Electronic Data Systems; and the in-house information technology, marketing
and design service departments of current and potential clients. These larger
firms may be better positioned than us to secure attractive client engagements,
and may also be better positioned to withstand any fluctuations in demand.

     Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories and relationships with clients; larger installed customer bases; and
significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations
resources than us. Competitors that have established relationships with large
companies but limited expertise in providing e-business solutions may
successfully use their client relationships to enter our target market or
prevent our penetration into their client accounts. We believe that due to the
low cost of entering our markets, competition will intensify and increase in the
future. This intense competition may limit our ability to become profitable or
result in the loss of market share. As a result, our competitors may be better
positioned to address developments in the industry or may react more effectively
to industry changes, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally,
because competition for Fortune 500 client accounts is significant, some clients
are demanding discounts and/or other preferred terms in their contracts. Our
unwillingness or inability to grant discounts in an effort to protect our profit
margins may impact our ability to attract and maintain these clients.

INCREASING GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

     We are affected not only by regulations applicable to businesses generally,
but also laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce.
Although there are currently few such laws and regulations, state, federal and
foreign governments may adopt a number of these laws and regulations. Any such
legislation or regulation could dampen the growth of the Internet and decrease
its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium. If such a decline
occurs, companies may decide in the future not to use our services to create an
electronic business channel. This decrease in the demand for our services would
seriously harm our business and operating results. Any new laws and regulations
may govern or restrict any of the following issues:

     - user privacy;

     - the pricing and taxation of goods and services offered over the Internet;

     - the content of websites;

     - consumer protection; and

     - the characteristics and quality of products and services offered over the
       Internet.

                STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This joint proxy
statement-prospectus contains such "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements relate to future events or Holdco's future financial performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
"may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes,"
"estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative
of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements include, but are
not limited to, statements regarding: the expected benefits of the merger such
as efficiencies, cost savings, market profile and financial strength, and the
competitive ability and position of the combined company. These statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause
Holdco's or its industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events
or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should
specifically consider various factors, including the inability to obtain, or
meet conditions imposed for, approvals for the business combination, failure of
the iXL or Scient stockholders to approve the mergers, the risk that iXL's and
Scient's businesses will not be coordinated and integrated successfully, and
disruption from the merger making it more difficult for Holdco to maintain
relationships with clients, lenders, employees, suppliers or other constituents.
These factors may cause Holdco's actual results to differ materially from any
forward-looking statement.

     Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. None of iXL, Scient or Holdco is under any obligation, and
each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

     All subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to iXL, Scient or
Holdco or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement-prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by each of iXL's and Scient's board
of directors in connection with the proposed merger.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     The special meetings are being held so that stockholders of each of iXL and
Scient may consider and vote upon

     - a proposal to adopt a merger agreement between iXL and Scient pursuant to
       which iXL and Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of a new
       holding company that will be named Scient, Inc.;

     - a proposal to adopt the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan to enable
       the conversion of certain outstanding iXL stock options upon the merger
       and the grant of stock options to employees and consultants of Holdco
       after the merger; and

     - any other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any
       adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

     If the stockholders of iXL and Scient adopt the merger agreement, upon
completion of the merger:

     - each outstanding share of iXL common stock will be converted into the
       right to receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock; and

     - each outstanding share of Scient common stock will be converted into the
       right to receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common stock.

STOCKHOLDER RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

     iXL.  iXL's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[               ], 2001 as the record date for determination of iXL stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were [               ] shares of iXL common stock outstanding, held by
approximately [               ] holders of record.

     Scient.  Scient's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[               ], 2001 as the record date for determination of Scient
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the
record date, there were [               ] shares of Scient common stock
outstanding, held by approximately [               ] holders of record.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSALS

     iXL.  A majority of the outstanding shares of iXL common stock must be
represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the iXL
special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of iXL's common stock outstanding as of the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast by iXL stockholders is required to adopt the Scient, Inc.
2001 Equity Incentive Plan. At the iXL special meeting, each share of iXL common
stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the iXL
stockholders. As of the record date, iXL directors and executive officers and
their affiliates owned approximately [               ]% of the outstanding
shares of iXL common stock.

     Scient.  A majority of the outstanding shares of Scient common stock must
be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the
Scient special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Scient's common stock outstanding as of the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast by Scient stockholders is required to adopt the Scient,
Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. At the Scient special meeting, each share of
Scient common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to
the Scient stockholders. As of the record date, Scient directors and executive
officers and their affiliates owned approximately [               ]% of the
outstanding shares of Scient common stock.

PROXIES

     All shares of iXL common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received before or at the iXL special meeting and all shares of Scient common
stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the Scient
special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance
with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no instructions are
indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted FOR
adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to
indicate how to vote your shares.

     If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
abstained from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the iXL common stock
or Scient common stock represented by the proxy or voting instruction will be
considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum,
but will be considered as having been voted AGAINST the adoption of the merger
agreement. If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
abstained from voting on adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan, the iXL common stock or Scient common stock represented by the proxy or
voting instruction will be considered present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum, but the proxy will not be counted with respect
to adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. If your shares are
held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to
vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank
holding shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have
discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the proposals, the shares will be
considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum, but will be considered as having been voted AGAINST the adoption of the
merger agreement and will not be counted with respect to adoption of the Scient,
Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only
if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided
to you by your broker.

     Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of iXL's common stock outstanding on the record date and
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Scient's common stock
outstanding on the record date, abstentions, failures to vote and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST adoption of the merger
agreement.

     The iXL special meeting or the Scient special meeting may be adjourned or
postponed, including by their respective chairmen, to permit further
solicitation of proxies. No proxy voted AGAINST the adoption of the merger
agreement will be voted on any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special
meeting that is submitted to the stockholders for a vote.

     Neither iXL nor Scient expects that any matter other than adoption of the
merger agreement and the adoption of the Holdco equity incentive plan will be
brought before its special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly
presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their
judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld on
the proxy card.

     A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted
by:

     - notifying in writing the Secretary of iXL Enterprises, Inc. at 1600
       Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA 30309, if you are an iXL stockholder, or
       the Secretary of Scient Corporation at 860 Broadway, 3(rd) Floor, New
       York, NY 10003, if you are a Scient stockholder;

     - granting a subsequently dated proxy; or

     - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder
       of record.

     Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     iXL and Scient will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with
the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. iXL has
retained [               ] for a fee of $[               ] plus additional
charges related to telephone calls and other services, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. Scient has retained [               ], at an estimated
cost of $[               ] plus reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. iXL, Scient and their respective proxy solicitors will
also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of iXL or
Scient common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy
statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will
reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of
proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic
means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or
employees of iXL and Scient. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

     You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A
transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement-prospectus describes material
aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement and the voting
agreements. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of
the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy statement-prospectus
and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding
of the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In the fall of 2000, Internet-related professional services firms began to
experience significant declines in revenues and profits primarily due to (i) a
broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients significantly tightened
technology budgets, (ii) increased competitive pressure from traditional
management consulting, information technology services, and eBusiness service
competitors, and (iii) a lack of urgency by Global 2000 companies to fund large
eBusiness projects. These negative industry trends dramatically affected the
financial results and market capitalizations of iXL, Scient and their peer
firms.

     In response to these developments, both iXL and Scient engaged in a series
of restructurings to reduce employees and each closed several offices. Both
companies also conducted a comprehensive review of their respective strategic
alternatives, ranging from standalone strategies to sale transactions.

     In February 2001, Scient engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to assist it in
conducting a comprehensive review of its strategic alternatives. As part of its
engagement, in February and March 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners contacted over 30
entities to evaluate their interest in a possible transaction with Scient. Of
the entities contacted, only one party ("Party A") expressed an interest in
pursuing a transaction with Scient, and in March 2001, Scient's board of
directors determined to enter into preliminary negotiations with respect to a
sale of Scient to Party A. However, Scient and Party A were unable to reach
agreement on a transaction and ceased negotiations in April 2001.

     Following termination of these discussions, Scient's management and board
continued their consideration of strategic alternatives intended to ensure
Scient's long-term viability and success. Among other things, Scient's
management had extensive discussions with outside legal, financial and real
estate advisors regarding strategies involving Scient remaining an independent
company, including how Scient might address its long-term real estate
obligations. Scient management also spoke to a number of third parties to assess
their potential interest in a transaction with Scient.

     Beginning in February 2001 and continuing through June 2001,
representatives of iXL executive management conducted a series of meetings with
various investment bankers to discuss alternatives available to iXL, including
the identification of potential merger partners or buyers. iXL management
believed that consolidation of the Internet consulting industry was necessary
and sought to participate in the consolidation process. No investment bankers
were engaged at this time. Also during this period, representatives of iXL
executive management had numerous informal discussions with several of its
competitors, none of which ultimately led to any significant prospects for a
business combination transaction. The potential for a business combination
transaction was frequently discussed by iXL executive management and members of
the iXL board of directors.

     Beginning in early 2000, Robert M. Howe, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Scient, and U. Bertram Ellis, Jr., Chairman of iXL, engaged in a
number of conversations to discuss a possible partnership or transaction between
iXL and Scient. In November 2000, Mr. Ellis telephoned Mr. Howe to discuss
various issues relating to a possible transaction between their companies.
During this call, Mr. Ellis suggested that consolidation in the industry was
inevitable and asked Mr. Howe if he would be open to considering a merger with
iXL. Mr. Howe indicated that such discussions were premature.

     In June 2001, Mr. Ellis called Mr. Howe to discuss the state of the
industry and the potential for a merger between iXL and Scient. The conversation
included a substantial amount of discussion as to how a merger could be
effected. Mr. Howe agreed to consider a potential merger and to discuss it with
some of Scient's board members.

     On July 10, 2001, Messrs. Ellis and Howe discussed high-level strategic and
financial details of a potential merger and agreed to meet in New York City on
July 12, 2001, with Stephen A. Mucchetti, Chief Operating Officer of Scient, and
Christopher M. Formant, President and Chief Executive Officer of iXL, to discuss
operational details of a potential merger. During this meeting, the group agreed
to meet again on the afternoon of July 13, 2001, to discuss further a potential
merger.

     During discussions on July 13, 2001, Messrs. Ellis, Formant, Howe, and
Mucchetti agreed that a merger was in the best interest of iXL and Scient, and
they also agreed to the basic financial terms of a merger and agreed upon many
operational and managerial issues relating to the merger, all of which were
subject to approval by both companies' boards of directors and the negotiation
of a definitive agreement. The group agreed to discuss the terms with the
individual members of their respective boards of directors, and if the
individual board members reacted favorably, the group would meet during the
following week with financial and legal advisors to negotiate a definitive
agreement. The companies executed a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement and each
began an independent due diligence review.

     On July 15, 2001, Messrs. Howe and Ellis talked via telephone, reporting
that the individual members of their respective board of directors reacted
positively to a potential merger and they agreed to proceed with discussions.

     On July 16, 2001, iXL retained First Union Securities, Inc. and Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation to provide financial advice to iXL and retained
Greenberg Traurig, LLP to provide legal representation.

     Scient retained Davis Polk & Wardwell on July 17, 2001 to provide legal
advice.

     On July 17, 2001, an enlarged staff of executives of each company and Kelso
& Company, a significant iXL stockholder, met to discuss possible structures and
terms for the proposed business combination of iXL and Scient. In attendance
were Mr. Ellis, Mr. Formant, Michael J. Casey, Chief Financial Officer of iXL,
Theodore W. Browne, II, General Counsel of iXL, Ronnie Brown, Vice President,
Corporate Operations of iXL, Mr. Howe, Mr. Mucchetti, and Michael Hand, Vice
President and Corporate Controller of Scient.

     The Scient board, which had discussed possible steps to address Scient's
significant financial challenges on numerous occasions during 2001, held a
regular telephonic meeting on July 18, 2001 to review thoroughly a range of
options potentially available to Scient. Among other things, Mr. Howe updated
the board on the discussions with iXL. The Scient board agreed with management
that a business combination with a third party like iXL on satisfactory terms
appeared to be the most attractive option for Scient and authorized management
to continue attempting to negotiate a transaction with iXL.

     On July 19, 2001, iXL delivered a first draft of the merger agreement to
Scient and its advisors. In the following days, the parties and their advisors
participated in meetings and telephone conversations to negotiate the terms of
the proposed transaction. The parties and their financial advisors, legal
advisors and accountants also continued to perform their due diligence reviews.

     On July 20, 2001, representatives of both companies, including legal
advisors, and Kelso & Company met to discuss possible structures and terms for
the proposed business combination of iXL and Scient.

     On July 23, 2001, meetings began at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell in
New York City with an enlarged staff of executives of each company as well as
representatives of each party's financial advisors and legal counsel. The
purpose of the meetings was to negotiate the details of a merger and to continue
due diligence efforts. In attendance were Mr. Ellis, Mr. Formant, Michael J.
Casey, Chief Financial Officer of iXL, Theodore W. Browne, II, General Counsel
of iXL, Ronnie Brown, Vice President, Corporate Operations of iXL, Mr. Howe, Mr.
Mucchetti, Michael Hand, Controller of Scient, Christina Bark, Associate General
Counsel of Scient, Robert Beck, Vice President and General Manager, Global
People of Scient, and representatives of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Davis Polk &
Wardwell, First Union Securities, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan
Stanley, and Thomas Weisel Partners.

     On July 24, 2001, the iXL board of directors held a special meeting via
telephonic conference call to discuss the merger. At this meeting, the board
reviewed the terms of the proposed transaction in conjunction with iXL's
management and legal advisors. The board was presented with the history and
terms of the

potential merger and the strategic implications of the transaction and key
issues raised by the due diligence process. The board received a legal analysis
by Greenberg Traurig, LLP with regard to the board's duties in evaluating the
transaction and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

     On July 26, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of the iXL board of
directors, iXL management updated the board on the status of the merger
negotiations.

     On July 26, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of the Scient board of
directors, the board reviewed the terms of the proposed transaction in
conjunction with Scient's management, Scient's financial advisors, and Scient's
legal advisors. Scient's real estate advisor, CB Richard Ellis, was also
available to answer any questions the board might have on real estate issues.
The board considered the presentation by Scient's management of the history and
terms of the transaction, the financial and strategic implications of the
transaction and key issues raised by the due diligence process. The board
received a financial analysis of the proposed transaction by Thomas Weisel
Partners. The board also considered the comments of Davis Polk & Wardwell on
both the board's duties in evaluating the transaction and the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and other transaction agreements. The board
requested a follow-up conversation to discuss the results of certain aspects of
Scient's due diligence review and instructed management to proceed with
negotiations with iXL on unresolved issues. On July 27, 2001, at two special
telephonic meetings of the Scient board of directors, the board received
additional information concerning certain iXL due diligence matters.

     On July 29 and 30, 2001, senior management of iXL and Scient and their
financial and legal advisors continued in their negotiations concerning the
terms of the proposed transaction.

     On July 30, 2001, the board of directors of iXL met via telephone
conference call to consider approving the proposed merger. At this meeting,
Messrs. Ellis, Formant, Casey, Browne and other members of management further
reviewed the transaction with the board, including the strategic reasons for the
proposed transaction, the principal terms of the proposed transaction, a
financial review of the proposed transaction, a review of Scient's financial
condition and business operations and the results of iXL's due diligence review.
iXL's legal counsel again discussed the board's fiduciary duties in considering
a strategic business combination and further discussed the terms of the merger
agreement and related documents. Representatives of First Union Securities, Inc.
and Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation presented a summary of their analyses
on the strategic rationale for and financial analyses related to the proposed
merger. Based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and
limitations set forth in its opinion, First Union Securities, Inc. delivered its
oral opinion (followed by its written opinion dated July 31, 2001) that the
ratio for exchanging shares of iXL common stock for shares of common stock of
Holdco contemplated by the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of iXL common stock. Upon completing deliberations, the
board of directors of iXL, by action of those present at the meeting,
unanimously approved the merger agreement and related agreements and the
transactions contemplated by those agreements, declared them advisable and
resolved to recommend that iXL's stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

     On July 30, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of Scient's board of
directors, the entire board reviewed the final proposed terms and conditions of
the transaction in conjunction with Scient's management and financial and legal
advisors. In connection with this review, the board also received the oral
opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners (followed by its written opinion dated July
31, 2001) as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration
to be received by Scient's stockholders. After due consideration, including
advice concerning their legal duties from Davis Polk & Wardwell, the board
unanimously approved the transaction and authorized the submission of the
transaction and the merger agreement to a vote of Scient's stockholders.

     On July 31, 2001, the parties executed definitive agreements in connection
with the transaction and issued a press release announcing the transaction.
Additionally, certain stockholders of iXL entered into a voting agreement with
Scient pursuant to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock
of iXL in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive
plan, and certain stockholders of Scient entered into a voting agreement with
iXL pursuant to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock of
Scient in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the equity incentive
plan.

IXL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; IXL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, iXL's board of
directors consulted with iXL's management, as well as with iXL's financial
advisors, independent accountants and legal advisors, including its General
Counsel and representatives of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, outside counsel to iXL,
and considered the following factors, among others:

     - the opportunity to create an entity more effectively positioned to
       succeed in the challenging market environment for information technology
       and web consultancy service companies by combining Scient's strengths in
       strategy consulting and architect design expertise with iXL's
       competitively priced development and implementation skills, which will
       allow Holdco to provide a broader and deeper range of solutions that
       address the needs of the market;

     - the opportunity to create more stable client relationships and expand
       revenue opportunities through the combined company's improved ability to
       win comprehensive engagements, as opposed to engagements involving only a
       subset of a solution needed by a client;

     - the improved depth of expertise that will result from the combination of
       iXL's and Scient's existing vertical industry groups;

     - the opportunity for Holdco to obtain the services of key members of
       Scient's management team, including Robert M. Howe as Chairman and
       Stephen A. Mucchetti as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
       Officer;

     - the enhanced ability of the combined company to better leverage through
       higher utilization the benefits of iXL's access to low-cost offshore
       resources through HPS, a strategic partner of iXL;

     - the opportunity to capitalize on Scient's favorable brand equity;

     - the substantial cost savings that could be achieved through consolidation
       of technology infrastructure and corporate overhead, including
       consolidation of office space;

     - the exchange ratios being used in the merger and the resulting continuing
       50% ownership interest in Holdco by iXL's stockholders and the history of
       the negotiations between iXL and Scient;

     - the presentations made by senior members of iXL's management regarding
       the long-term strategic advantages of combining with Scient, operational
       aspects of the transaction, and the results of management's operational
       and legal due diligence review;

     - historical information concerning iXL's and Scient's respective
       businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
       management, competitive position and stock performance;

     - iXL management's view as to the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of iXL and Scient before and after giving
       effect to the merger based on management's due diligence and publicly
       available consensus earnings estimates;

     - the opportunities and alternatives available to iXL if the merger were
       not to be undertaken, including remaining independent, pursuing an
       acquisition of or business combination or joint venture with entities
       other than Scient and the conclusion that a combination with Scient is
       expected to yield greater long-term benefits and is more feasible than
       the alternatives;

     - the opinion of First Union Securities, Inc. (and limitations set forth in
       the opinion) that the exchange ratio of Holdco common stock for iXL
       common stock was fair, to the common stockholders of iXL, from a
       financial point of view, and the analysis underlying the opinion of First
       Union Securities, Inc.;

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the voting agreements,
       and the affiliate registration rights agreement, including the fact that
       the exchange ratios are fixed, the limitations on and coordination of the
       interim business operations of each of iXL and Scient, the conditions to
       consummation of the merger, the right of the parties to the merger
       agreement, under certain circumstances, to respond to, evaluate and
       negotiate with respect to other business combination

proposals, the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be
terminated and the size and impact of termination fees associated with a
termination;

     - the corporate governance arrangements for Holdco, including the board
       composition, designation of key senior management and the establishment
       of a transition team, which are designed to promote the continuity of
       management from each company and smooth integration of the businesses;

     - the expected non-taxable nature of the merger for U.S. federal income tax
       purposes;

     - the accounting treatment of the transaction as a "purchase" transaction
       and deemed acquisition by iXL;

     - the interests of the officers and directors of iXL and Scient in the
       merger, including the matters described under "-- Interests of Certain
       iXL Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," and the impact of
       the merger on iXL's stockholders, customers and employees;

     - the challenges of combining the businesses, assets and workforces of two
       companies and the risks of not achieving the expected operating
       efficiencies or growth; and

     - the risk that management focus and resources will be diverted from other
       strategic opportunities and from operational matters while working to
       implement the merger.

     The discussion above sets forth the material information and factors
considered by iXL's board in its consideration of the merger agreement. Members
of iXL's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of their knowledge
of iXL's business, the industry in which Scient and iXL operate and their
business judgment. In view of the wide variety of factors considered, the iXL
board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make specific assessments of,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. The determination to approve the
merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In
addition, individual members of iXL's board may have given different weight to
different factors.

     IXL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER WITH SCIENT AND UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF IXL AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. THE IXL BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF IXL VOTE FOR THE MERGER AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

SCIENT'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; SCIENT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, Scient's board of
directors consulted with Scient's management, as well as with Scient's financial
advisors, independent accountants, real estate advisors and legal advisors, and
considered the following factors, among others:

     - the opportunity to blend both companies' engineering and user experience
       skills and to combine Scient's strategy capabilities, which are based on
       its industry expertise, and its business/technical architectural design
       skills with iXL's on- and off-shore capabilities and vendor alliance
       program, allowing the combined company to compete more effectively for
       engagements by delivering fully integrated business solutions;

     - the opportunity for the combined company to obtain the services of key
       members of iXL's management team, including U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. as Vice
       Chairman and Christopher M. Formant as President and Chief Executive
       Officer;

     - the synergies that the combined company could realize through reductions
       in infrastructure costs, including consolidation of offices, and the fact
       that the combination would not result in any material increase in real
       estate obligations for Scient;

     - the enhanced ability of the combined company to recruit and retain
       colleagues;

     - the significant challenges facing Scient as an independent company as a
       result of, among other things, the dramatic decline in the demand for
       Scient's services over the past twelve months and the inability to
       anticipate its future project pipeline;

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information about Scient common stock and iXL
       common stock;

     - the exchange ratio negotiated with iXL and the implied premium
       represented by the exchange ratio, based on recent and historical market
       prices of Scient's common stock as of the date of the merger agreement,
       and how this premium compared to price premiums in recent comparable
       transactions involving Internet professional services companies;

     - the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
       termination fee payable to Scient or to iXL under specified circumstances
       and the ability of Scient to negotiate other unsolicited strategic
       transaction proposals if the Scient board of directors believes in good
       faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
       financial advisors, that any such other proposal would be reasonably
       likely to lead to a proposal that is more favorable to the Scient
       stockholders than the transaction with iXL;

     - the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners, based on and subject to the
       assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion,
       that the consideration to be received by Scient's stockholders was fair,
       from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Scient, and the
       analysis underlying the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners;

     - information and presentations by Scient's management and legal, financial
       and real estate advisors concerning the business, technology, services,
       operations, financial condition, organizational structure and competitive
       positions of Scient and iXL on both a historical and prospective basis;

     - the fact that in February and March 2001 Thomas Weisel Partners contacted
       over 30 different entities regarding a potential strategic transaction
       with Scient, that this process identified only one potentially interested
       party, Party A, and that Scient was unable to reach agreement with Party
       A on the terms of a transaction;

     - the proposed corporate governance arrangements for the combined company,
       which will have a board of directors comprised of three current members
       of Scient's board, three current members of iXL's board and two
       independent directors;

     - the terms and conditions of the voting agreements entered into by certain
       stockholders of Scient and iXL;

     - the interests of certain directors and executive officers of Scient that
       are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Scient's
       stockholders generally as described under "-- Interests of Certain Scient
       Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger";

     - the qualification of the merger as a reorganization that is tax-free to
       Scient's stockholders; and

     - the fact that the merger is subject to approval by stockholders of Scient
       and by stockholders of iXL.

     The discussion above sets forth the material information and factors
considered by Scient's board in its consideration of the merger agreement.
Members of Scient's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of their
knowledge of Scient's business, the industry in which Scient and iXL operate and
their business judgment. In view of the wide variety of factors considered, the
Scient board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make specific
assessments of, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination. The determination to
approve the merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a
whole. In addition, individual members of Scient's board may have given
different weight to different factors.

     SCIENT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND THE MERGER WITH IXL AND UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SCIENT AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. THE SCIENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF SCIENT VOTE FOR THE MERGER AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF IXL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Under an engagement letter dated July 23, 2001, First Union Securities,
Inc. has acted as iXL's financial advisor in connection with the merger. iXL
selected First Union Securities based on First Union Securities' experience,
expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with iXL's business. First Union
Securities is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     In connection with First Union Securities' engagement, the iXL board of
directors requested that First Union Securities evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of iXL common stock, of the iXL exchange
ratio set forth in the merger agreement. On July 30, 2001, at a meeting of iXL's
board of directors held to evaluate the merger agreement, First Union Securities
rendered an oral opinion to the board of directors, which opinion was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated July 31, 2001, to the effect that, as of
July 30, 2001, with respect to the oral opinion, and July 31, 2001, with respect
to the written opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
and limitations described in the written opinion, the iXL exchange ratio of 0.25
shares of Holdco common stock for each share of iXL common stock was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of iXL common stock.

     The full text of First Union Securities' written opinion dated July 31,
2001 to iXL's board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. HOLDERS OF IXL COMMON STOCK ARE ENCOURAGED
TO, AND SHOULD, READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. The summary of
First Union Securities' opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion.

     First Union Securities' opinion is addressed to iXL's board of directors
only and except for inclusion of the opinion in its entirety (and related
references thereto) in this joint proxy statement-prospectus as sent by iXL to
holders of iXL common stock in connection with the merger or in any filing made
by iXL or Holdco with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
governmental agency in connection with the merger, may not be referred to,
disclosed to any third party or used for any other purpose, without First Union
Securities' prior written consent. The opinion relates only to the fairness of
the iXL exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of iXL
common stock, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related
transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any of iXL's
stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger
agreement, or whether or not such stockholder should seek to exercise any
dissenters' or appraisals rights that may be available, and should not be relied
upon by any stockholder as such. In rendering its opinion, First Union
Securities has assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms
described in the draft merger agreement that it reviewed, without any waiver of
any material terms or conditions. First Union Securities' written opinion
addresses only the fairness of the iXL exchange ratio from a financial point of
view and does not address iXL's underlying business decision to effect the
merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
or the merits of the proposed merger relative to any alternative transaction or
business strategy that may be available to iXL.

     In arriving at its opinion, First Union Securities has, among other things:

     - Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the draft merger agreement
       dated July 30, 2001 and the final merger agreement;

     - Reviewed certain business, financial and other information, including
       financial forecasts, regarding iXL and Scient that was publicly available
       or furnished to it by members of iXL's or Scient's management teams, and
       has discussed with such management teams their respective company's
       business and prospects;

     - Considered certain financial data related to iXL and Scient and (i)
       compared that data with similar data for publicly held companies in
       businesses similar to those of iXL and Scient and (ii) compared iXL's and
       Scient's data relative to one another;

     - Reviewed certain pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company
       that were jointly prepared and furnished to it by members of iXL's and
       Scient's management teams and has discussed with such management teams
       the business and prospects of the combined company;

     - Considered the financial terms of certain other business combinations and
       other transactions which have recently been effected; and

     - Considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
       investigations as well as financial and economic and market criteria that
       First Union Securities deemed relevant.

     In connection with its review, First Union Securities has relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the foregoing financial and other information, and
has not assumed any responsibility for any independent verification of such
information. With respect to iXL's and Scient's financial forecasts and the pro
forma financial forecasts of the combined company, First Union Securities has
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best current
estimates and judgments of iXL's and Scient's management teams as to the future
financial performance of their respective companies and the combined company.
First Union Securities has discussed iXL's and Scient's financial forecasts and
the pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company with the respective
management teams of iXL and Scient, but First Union Securities assumes no
responsibility for and expresses no view as to iXL's or Scient's financial
forecasts, the pro forma financial forecasts of the combined company, or the
assumptions upon which any of them are based. Furthermore, in arriving at its
opinion, First Union Securities has not conducted any physical inspections of
the properties or facilities of iXL or Scient, and has not made any independent
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of iXL or Scient. In
addition, in arriving at its opinion, First Union Securities has reviewed
certain summary information regarding iXL's venture investment portfolio and,
with the permission of iXL's board of directors, has relied solely upon guidance
from iXL's management as to its value.

     First Union Securities' opinion was necessarily based upon economic,
market, financial and other conditions as they existed and were subject to
evaluation by First Union Securities on the date of the opinion, and the
information made available to First Union Securities as of that date. Events
occurring after July 31, 2001 could materially affect the assumptions used in
preparing the opinion. First Union Securities has not undertaken to and is not
obligated to affirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment on any events
occurring after the date its opinion was given.

     In preparing its opinion to iXL's board of directors, First Union
Securities performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including
those described below. The summary of First Union Securities' analyses described
below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying First Union
Securities' opinion.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, First Union
Securities made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor that it considered. Accordingly, First Union Securities
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion. In its analyses, First Union Securities
considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
iXL and Scient. No company, transaction or business used in First Union
Securities' analyses as a comparison is identical to iXL or Scient or the
merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not

entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involved complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other facts
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions being analyzed. The estimates
contained in First Union Securities' analyses and the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition,
analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, First Union Securities' analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. First Union Securities' opinion
and related financial analyses was only one of many factors considered by iXL's
board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of iXL's board of directors or its management with
respect to the merger or the iXL exchange ratio.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
First Union Securities in connection with the preparation of its opinion and
reviewed with iXL's board of directors at their meeting held on July 30, 2001.
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular
format. To fully understand First Union Securities' financial analyses, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do
not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of First Union Securities' financial analyses.

  Common Stock Trading History

     First Union Securities examined the historical closing prices of iXL and
Scient common stock from July 27, 2000 to July 27, 2001. iXL common stock
reached a high of $17.75 per share and a low of $0.75 per share, and Scient
common stock reached a high of $54.94 per share and a low of $0.58 per share.

  Relative Contribution Analysis

     First Union Securities analyzed the pro forma financial contribution of iXL
and Scient to the combined company, assuming consummation of the merger, based
on historical financial results and projections provided by iXL and Scient
management. First Union Securities calculated the implied ownership and the
implied iXL exchange ratio of the combined company based on these financial
contributions. The analysis showed, among other things, the following:

Market capitalization at 7/27/01.........................  30.2%    69.8%      0.341x
Latest quarter annualized revenues.......................  25.7%    74.3%      0.363x
2001 projected revenues..................................  30.9%    69.1%      0.337x
Net tangible assets at 6/30/01...........................  57.9%    42.1%      0.205x
Projected unrestricted cash at 9/30/01...................  96.5%    3.5%       0.017x

Unrestricted cash is defined as cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, less cash collateralizing letters of credit relating to real estate
commitments. First Union Securities noted that the iXL exchange ratio of 0.250x
contemplated in the merger agreement was within the range of iXL exchange ratios
implied by the relative contribution analysis.

  iXL Financial Analysis

     Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis:  First Union Securities
analyzed the enterprise values and corresponding trading multiples of selected
publicly traded companies in the IT Services industry that First Union
Securities believed were reasonably comparable to iXL. These comparable
companies included:

     - Digitas Inc.

     - DiamondCluster International, Inc.

     - eLoyalty Corporation

     - Inforte Corp.

     - KPMG Consulting, Inc.

     - Modem Media, Inc.

     - Razorfish, Inc.

     - Sapient Corporation

     - Scient Corporation

     - Viant Corporation

     In examining these comparable companies, First Union Securities calculated
the enterprise value of each company as a multiple of its respective: (a) latest
reported quarter annualized revenues, (b) projected calendar year 2001 revenues
and (c) projected calendar year 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company
is equal to the value of its fully diluted common equity plus debt and the
liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus cash and cash
equivalents. All historical data were derived from publicly available sources
and all projected data were obtained from research analysts' estimates. Trading
prices and equity values used in calculating the following ranges are as of July
27, 2001. All other data used in calculating enterprise value are as of the most
recent publicly available financial statements of each company. First Union
Securities' analysis of the comparable companies yielded the following
enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                 RANGE         MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            ----------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenue...........................  (1.70x) to 1.42x   0.61x
CY 2001 projected revenues..................................  (2.10x) to 1.49x   0.68x
CY 2002 projected revenues..................................  (2.98x) to 1.61x   0.62x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable companies to the historical and projected results for comparable
periods of iXL to derive an implied enterprise value range for iXL of $96.4
million to $100.0 million. First Union Securities then added the value of iXL's
cash and cash equivalents less debt, plus the estimated value of iXL's venture
portfolio interest to iXL's implied enterprise value range to arrive at an
implied equity value range for iXL of $128.2 million to $131.7 million. This
equates to an implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.32 to
$1.36, with a median implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.33.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis:  Using publicly available information,
First Union Securities analyzed the purchase prices and implied enterprise value
multiples in the following selected merger and acquisition transactions in the
IT Services industry (acquiror/target):

     - CIBER, Inc./Aris Corporation

     - eXcelon Corporation/C-bridge Internet Solutions, Inc.

     - Motient Corporation/Rare Medium Group, Inc.

     - Dimension Data Holdings plc/Proxicom, Inc.

     - International Business Machines Corporation/Mainspring, Inc.

     - Novell, Inc./Cambridge Technology Partners (Massachusetts), Inc.

     - Red Hat, Inc./Planning Technologies, Inc.

     - CGI Group Inc./IMRglobal Corp.

     - ICICI Infotech Inc./Command Systems, Inc.

     In examining these comparable transactions, First Union Securities
calculated the enterprise value of each target company as a multiple of its
respective (a) latest quarter annualized revenues, (b) 2001 projected revenues
and (c) projected 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company is equal to
the amount offered by an acquiror for a target company's fully diluted common
equity plus the value of debt and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock, if any, minus cash and cash equivalents. All historical data were derived
from publicly available sources and all projected data were obtained from
research analysts' estimates. First Union Securities' analysis of the comparable
transactions yielded the following enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                RANGE       MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            -------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenues..........................   0.3x to 2.4x   0.74x
2001 projected revenues.....................................   0.3x to 2.6x   0.63x
2002 projected revenues.....................................   0.2x to 2.1x   0.35x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable transactions to the historical and projected results for
comparable periods of iXL to derive an implied enterprise value range for iXL of
$54.4 million to $120.6 million. First Union Securities then added the value of
iXL's cash and cash equivalents less debt, plus the estimated value of iXL's
venture portfolio interest to iXL's implied enterprise value range to arrive at
an implied equity value range for iXL of $86.1 million to $152.3 million. This
equates to an implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $0.89 to
$1.57, with a median implied equity value per fully diluted iXL share of $1.25.

     Liquidation Value Analysis:  First Union Securities performed a liquidation
value analysis for iXL based upon certain assumed values of its assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 2001. In the analysis, First Union Securities
analyzed two scenarios. In the first scenario, First Union Securities assumed
the value of iXL's tangible assets to be 100% of book value with the exception
of its Property Plant and Equipment, which was assumed to be 50% of book value,
and cash, which was reduced by cash collateralizing certain outstanding letters
of credit. In addition, iXL's venture portfolio interest was assumed to be 100%
of the value estimated by iXL management. All liabilities were assumed to be
paid in full in the event of liquidation. In the second scenario, First Union
Securities analyzed salvage values for non-cash tangible assets, other than
iXL's venture portfolio interest, at 50% of the value assumed in the first
scenario while all liabilities were again assumed to be paid in full. This
analysis resulted in an equity value range for iXL of $3.8 million to $37.7
million, or $0.04 to $0.39 per fully diluted iXL share, with a median value of
$0.21 per fully diluted iXL share.

  Scient Financial Analysis

     - Inforte Corp.

     - iXL Enterprises, Inc.

     - KPMG Consulting, Inc.

     - Modem Media, Inc.

     - Razorfish, Inc.

     - Sapient Corporation

and (c) projected calendar year 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company
is equal to the value of its fully diluted common equity plus debt and the
liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus cash and cash

prices and equity values used in calculating the following ranges are as of July
27, 2001. All other data used in calculating enterprise value are as of the most
recent publicly available financial statements of each company. First Union
Securities' analysis of the comparable companies yielded the following
enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                 RANGE         MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            ----------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenue...........................  (1.70x) to 1.42x   0.61x

CY 2002 projected revenues..................................  (2.98x) to 1.61x   0.62x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable companies to the historical and projected results for comparable
periods of Scient to derive an implied enterprise value range for Scient of
$40.9 million to $66.5 million. First Union Securities then added the value of
Scient's cash and cash equivalents less debt to Scient's implied enterprise
value range to arrive at an implied equity value range for Scient of $150.6
million to $176.2 million. This equates to an implied equity value per fully
diluted Scient share of $2.02 to $2.37, with a median implied equity value per
fully diluted Scient share of $2.06.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis:  Using publicly available information,
First Union Securities analyzed the purchase prices and implied enterprise value
multiples in the following selected merger and acquisition transactions in the
IT Services industry (acquiror/target):

     - CIBER, Inc./Aris Corporation

     - eXcelon Corporation/C-bridge Internet Solutions, Inc.

     - Motient Corporation/Rare Medium Group, Inc.

     - Dimension Data Holdings plc/Proxicom, Inc.

     - Red Hat, Inc./Planning Technologies, Inc.

     - CGI Group Inc./IMRglobal Corp.

     - ICICI Infotech Inc./Command Systems, Inc.

     In examining these comparable transactions, First Union Securities
calculated the enterprise value of each target company as a multiple of its
respective (a) latest quarter annualized revenues, (b) 2001 projected revenues
and (c) projected 2002 revenues. The enterprise value of a company is equal to
the amount offered by an acquiror for a target company's fully diluted common
equity plus the value of debt and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock, if any, minus cash and cash equivalents. All historical data were derived

from publicly available sources and all projected data were obtained from
research analyst estimates. First Union Securities' analysis of the comparable
transactions yielded the following enterprise value multiples:

ENTERPRISE VALUE AS A MULTIPLE OF:                                RANGE       MEDIAN
- ----------------------------------                            -------------   ------

Latest quarter annualized revenues..........................   0.3x to 2.4x   0.74x

2002 projected revenues.....................................   0.2x to 2.1x   0.35x

     First Union Securities applied the median enterprise value multiples from
the comparable transactions to the historical and projected results for
comparable periods of Scient to derive an implied enterprise value range for
Scient of $23.0 million to $80.2 million. First Union Securities then added the
value of Scient's cash and cash equivalents less debt to Scient's implied
enterprise value range to arrive at an implied equity value range for Scient of
$132.7 million to $189.9 million. This equates to an implied equity value per
fully diluted Scient share of $1.78 to $2.55, with a median implied equity value
per fully diluted Scient share of $2.01.

     Liquidation Value Analysis:  First Union Securities performed a liquidation
value analysis for Scient based upon certain assumed values of its assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 2001. In the analysis, First Union Securities
analyzed two scenarios. In the first scenario, First Union Securities assumed
the value of Scient's tangible assets to be 100% of book value with the
exception of its Property Plant and Equipment which was assumed to be 50% of
book value, and cash, which was reduced by cash collateralizing certain
outstanding letters of credit. All liabilities were assumed to be paid in full
in the event of liquidation. In the second scenario, First Union Securities
analyzed salvage values for non-cash tangible assets at 50% of the value assumed
in the first scenario while all liabilities were again assumed to be paid in
full. This analysis resulted in an equity value range for Scient of $63.3
million to $75.4 million, or $0.85 to $1.01 per fully diluted Scient share, with
a median value of $0.93 per fully diluted Scient share.

  Exchange Ratio Analysis

     From the valuation methodologies employed in the analyses described above,
First Union Securities derived a range of implied values for Holdco, the company
to be formed by the combination of iXL and Scient in the merger, for the purpose
of evaluating the iXL exchange ratio. First Union Securities established an
implied equity value range for iXL and Scient based on the median equity values
from each of the preceding valuation analyses, as follows:

                                                             LOW VALUE
                                                             PER SHARE    LOW EQUITY VALUE
                                                             ----------   -----------------

iXL........................................................    $0.21        $20.7 million
Scient.....................................................    $0.93        $69.3 million

                                                             HIGH VALUE
                                                             PER SHARE    HIGH EQUITY VALUE
                                                             ----------   -----------------

iXL........................................................    $1.33       $128.4 million
Scient.....................................................    $2.06       $152.9 million

     By combining the low iXL equity value with the high Scient equity value and
the high iXL equity value with the low Scient equity value, First Union
Securities established an implied value range for Holdco of $173.7 million to
$197.7 million. Applying the iXL exchange ratio of 0.250x and the Scient
exchange ratio of 0.310x to the iXL and Scient fully diluted shares outstanding,
respectively, First Union Securities calculated the number of fully diluted
Holdco shares to be issued in the merger which was used to derive the implied
value range per share of Holdco of $3.67 to $4.18.

     First Union Securities next compared the low and high iXL value per share
above to the respective implied Holdco value per share range to derive an
implied iXL exchange ratio for evaluation against the iXL exchange ratio
contemplated in the merger agreement of 0.250x, as shown in the table below:

                                                               LOW      HIGH
                                                              ------   ------

Implied iXL value per share.................................  $ 0.21   $ 1.33
Implied Holdco value per share..............................  $ 3.67   $ 4.18
Implied iXL exchange ratio..................................   0.058x   0.317x

     Pursuant to the terms of First Union Securities' engagement letter with
iXL, iXL has agreed to pay First Union Securities the following fees for its
financial advisory services in connection with the merger: (i) $400,000 upon its
delivery of a fairness opinion and (ii) $600,000 upon the consummation of the
merger. iXL also has agreed to reimburse First Union Securities for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel
and any other advisor retained by First Union Securities, and to indemnify First
Union Securities and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

     First Union Securities is an investment banking firm and an affiliate of
First Union Corporation. First Union Securities makes a market in iXL's common
stock, provides research coverage on iXL's common stock and has in the past
provided investment banking services to iXL. First Union National Bank, an
affiliate of First Union Securities, is currently a lender to iXL. In the
ordinary course of its business, First Union Securities and its affiliates may
actively trade or hold the securities of iXL or Scient, for our own account or
for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities. In addition, First Union Securities and
its affiliates (including First Union Corporation and its affiliates) may
maintain relationships with iXL and Scient.

OPINION OF SCIENT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Thomas Weisel Partners has acted as financial advisor to Scient in
connection with the merger. On July 30, 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners delivered
to the board of directors of Scient its oral opinion that, as of that date, the
consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view. Thomas
Weisel Partners then delivered its written opinion, dated July 31, 2001,
confirming its oral opinion. Scient did not impose any limitations on Thomas
Weisel Partners with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed
in rendering its opinion.

     The full text of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion is attached as Annex F
to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Stockholders of Scient are urged to,
and should, read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. We have, however,
included the following summary of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion.

     Thomas Weisel Partners has directed its opinion to the board of directors
of Scient. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to you as to how you
should vote with respect to the transaction. The opinion addresses only the
fairness of the consideration to shareholders of Scient from a financial point
of view. It does not address the relative merits of the merger or any
alternatives to the merger. Further, it does not address Scient's underlying
decision to proceed with or effect the merger. In furnishing its opinion, Thomas
Weisel Partners did not admit that it is an expert within the meaning of the
term "expert" as used in the Securities Act of 1933, nor did it admit that its
opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933. The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion includes statements to this
effect.

     In connection with its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect
       to Scient and iXL, including the consolidated financial statements for
       recent years and interim periods to June 30, 2001 and certain other
       relevant financial and operating data relating to Scient and iXL made
       available to Thomas Weisel Partners from published sources and from the
       internal records of both companies;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
       the voting agreements;

     - reviewed certain publicly available information concerning the trading
       of, and the trading market for, Scient's and iXL's common stock;

     - compared Scient and iXL from a financial point of view with other
       companies in the Internet Professional Services industry that Thomas
       Weisel Partners deemed to be relevant;

     - considered the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       selected recent business combinations of companies in the Internet
       Professional Services industry that Thomas Weisel Partners deemed to be
       comparable, in whole or in part, to the merger;

     - reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of Scient
       and iXL certain information of a business and financial nature regarding
       Scient and iXL, furnished to Thomas Weisel Partners by them, including
       financial forecasts and related assumptions for Scient and iXL;

     - made inquiries regarding and discussed the merger and the merger
       agreement and other matters related thereto with Scient's counsel; and

     - performed such other analyses and examinations as Thomas Weisel Partners
       deemed appropriate.

     In preparing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume any
obligation to independently verify the information referred to above. Instead,
with Scient's consent, Thomas Weisel Partners relied on the information being
accurate and complete in all material respects. Thomas Weisel Partners also made
the following assumptions, in each case with Scient's consent:

     - with respect to the financial forecasts for Scient and iXL described
       above, Thomas Weisel Partners assumed for purposes of its opinion, upon
       the advice of management of Scient and iXL, that (a) these forecasts
       (including, without limitation, forecasts relating to cost savings and
       operating synergies) have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
       the best available estimates and judgments of management of Scient and
       iXL at the time of preparation as to the future financial performance of
       Scient and iXL, and (b) these forecasts provided a reasonable basis upon
       which Thomas Weisel Partners could form its opinion;

     - that there have been no material changes in Scient's or iXL's assets,
       financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since
       the respective dates of their last financial statements made available to
       Thomas Weisel Partners;

     - that the transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in all
       respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
       the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and all other applicable federal and
       state statutes, rules and regulations;

     - that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be
       treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the United States
       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

     - that the transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms
       described in the merger agreement, without any further amendment thereto,
       and without any waiver by Scient of any of the conditions to any party's
       obligations thereunder.

In addition, for purposes of its opinion:

     - Thomas Weisel Partners relied on advice of Scient's independent
       accountants as to all financial reporting matters with respect to Scient,
       and Scient's independent counsel with respect to legal matters relating
       to the merger and the merger agreement; and

     - Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume responsibility for making an
       independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or
       liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Scient or iXL, nor was Thomas
       Weisel Partners furnished with any such appraisals.

     The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion was based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Thomas Weisel Partners as of, the date of its opinion.

Accordingly, although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, Thomas
Weisel Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion.

     The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners in connection with providing its opinion to
the board of directors of Scient. Some of the summaries of financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners, you should read the tables together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners.

     In connection with providing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners used two
approaches in measuring the implied market value of the consideration to be
received by shareholders of Scient pursuant to the merger. The first valuation
approach used by Thomas Weisel Partners was to take the sum of the market values
of Scient and iXL as of the date of the fairness opinion and to allocate 49% of
that sum as the implied consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient
in the merger. The second valuation approach used by Thomas Weisel Partners was
to value the consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient in the
merger based on the market value of iXL as of the date of the fairness opinion
multiplied by the implied Scient exchange ratio. These two approaches used by
Thomas Weisel Partners constituted the outside limits of the ranges discussed in
the analyses set forth below.

     Comparable Company Valuation Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated aggregate value, which Thomas
Weisel Partners defined as equity value plus debt less cash, as a multiple of
estimated revenue for companies in the Internet Professional Services industry
for calendar years 2001 through 2002. Thomas Weisel Partners believes that the
following 12 companies have operations similar to some of the operations of
Scient, but noted that none of these companies has the same management,
composition, size or combination of businesses as Scient: AGENCY.COM Ltd.; Braun
Consulting Inc.; Cysive Inc.; Digitas Inc.; Inforte Corp.; Lante Corporation;
Modem Media Inc.; Organic Inc.; Razorfish Inc.; Sapient Corp.; Tanning
Technology Corp; and Viant Corp.

     The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis:

AGGREGATE VALUE TO                                         LOW     MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH
- ------------------                                        -----    ----   ------   ----

2001 Estimated Revenues.................................  (1.99)x  0.25x   0.57x   1.59x
2002 Estimated Revenues.................................  (1.63)x  0.31x   0.50x   1.89x

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the range of the aggregate values of the
consideration to be received by shareholders of Scient in connection with the
merger implied ratios of Scient's aggregate value to (1) calendar year 2001
estimated revenues ranging from 0.36x to 0.77x and (2) calendar year 2002
estimated revenues ranging from 0.34x to 0.74x.

     While the comparable company valuation analysis compared Scient to 12
companies in the Internet Professional Services industry, Thomas Weisel Partners
did not include every company that could be deemed to be a participant in this
same industry or in the specific sectors of this industry.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated aggregate value as a multiple of
revenue for the last twelve months, or LTM, and for the next twelve months, or
NTM, in seven particularly comparable acquisitions of Internet Professional
Services companies that have been announced since February 21, 2001:

ANNOUNCEMENT DATE                  NAME OF ACQUIROR             NAME OF TARGET
- -----------------                  ----------------             --------------

June 14, 2001..................  CIBER                   ARIS Corp.
May 23, 2001...................  Excelon                 C-Bridge Internet Solutions
May 15, 2001...................  Motient Corporation     Rare Medium
May 7, 2001....................  Dimension Data          Proxicom
April 19, 2001.................  IBM (Global Services)   Mainspring
March 12, 2001.................  Novell                  Cambridge Technology Partners
February 21, 2001..............  CGI Group (Canada)      IMRglobal

     The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis and
the range of multiples implied by the proposed merger:

AGGREGATE VALUE TO:                               LOW    MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH     MERGER
- -------------------                               ----   ----   ------   ----   ----------

LTM Revenue.....................................  0.27x  0.95x   0.90x   1.87x  0.10x-0.22x
NTM Revenue.....................................  0.28x  0.92x   0.53x   2.45x  0.41x-0.88x

     No company or transaction used in the comparable company or comparable
transactions analyses is identical to Scient, iXL or the merger. Accordingly, an
analysis of the results of the foregoing is not mathematical; rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that
could affect the public trading value of the companies to which Scient, iXL and
the transaction are being compared.

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the consideration
paid in comparable U.S. acquisitions in the technology industry (excluding the
healthcare technology and manufacturing industries), involving an aggregate
value of $50-$150 million, announced between January 1, 1999 and July 16, 2001.
Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the premiums paid in these transactions over
the share price of the acquired company as of one day, one week and one month
prior to the announcement of the acquisition offer.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the share price of the
acquired company with respect to these technology transactions:

                                                          LOW     MEAN   MEDIAN   HIGH
                                                         -----    ----   ------   -----

Premium One Day Prior to Announcement..................  (19.2)%  41.7%   28.5%   190.3%
Premium One Week Prior to Announcement.................  (47.5)%  55.3%   40.9%   322.3%
Premium One Month Prior to Announcement................  (55.1)%  67.8%   58.8%   298.1%

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the share price premium implied by the
merger as of one day prior to the date of Thomas Weisel Partners' analyses
ranged from 61.5% to 120.2%; the implied premium as of one week prior to the
date of Thomas Weisel Partners' analyses ranged from 53.6% to 109.4%; and the
implied premium as of one month prior to the date of Thomas Weisel Partners'
analyses ranged from (13.2%) to 18.3%.

     Contribution Analysis.  Based on public and other available information,
Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the estimated contribution of Scient to
estimated revenue and gross profit for fiscal years 2001 through 2002 for the
combined company.

     The following table shows the percentage contributions indicated by this
analysis:

TOTAL REVENUES
  2001 Projected............................................  31.0%
  2002 Projected............................................  29.7%
GROSS PROFIT
  2001 Projected............................................   9.1%
  2002 Projected............................................  25.0%

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the forecasted share ownership of the
combined company to be held by the stockholders of Scient was 49%.

     Liquidation Analysis.  Scient's management estimated that the per-share
amount that would be distributed to shareholders of Scient in the event of a
liquidation of Scient would be between $0.43 and $0.64 per share. Thomas Weisel
Partners noted that the per-share value implied by the merger ranged from $0.94
to $1.28 per share.

     The foregoing description is only a summary of the analyses and
examinations that Thomas Weisel Partners deems material to its opinion. It is
not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually
conducted by Thomas Weisel Partners. The preparation of a fairness opinion
necessarily is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Thomas Weisel Partners believes that its analyses and the summary set forth
above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
would create an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth
in its presentation to the board of directors of Scient. In addition, Thomas
Weisel Partners may have given various analyses more or less weight than other
analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in
the summary above is not meant to indicate that this analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis. Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view
of Thomas Weisel Partners with respect to the actual value of Scient.

     In performing its analyses, Thomas Weisel Partners made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Scient and
iXL. The analyses performed by Thomas Weisel Partners are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. These analyses
were prepared solely as part of the analysis performed by Thomas Weisel Partners
with respect to the financial fairness of the consideration to be received by
Scient's shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement, and were provided to the
board of directors of Scient in connection with the delivery of the Thomas
Weisel Partners opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at
which any securities may trade at any time in the future.

     As described above, Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion and presentation were
among the many factors that the board of directors of Scient took into
consideration in making its determination to approve, and to recommend that its
stockholders approve, the merger agreement and the Scient merger.

     Scient has agreed to pay Thomas Weisel Partners the following fees with
respect to the merger: (i) $400,000 upon its delivery of a fairness opinion and
(ii) $600,000 upon the consummation of the merger. Scient was aware of this fee
structure and took it into account in considering the Thomas Weisel Partners
opinion and in approving the transaction. Further, Scient has agreed to
reimburse Thomas Weisel Partners for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
to indemnify Thomas Weisel Partners, its affiliates, and their respective
partners, directors, officers, agents, consultants, employees and controlling
persons against specific liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

     Scient selected Thomas Weisel Partners to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger based on Thomas Weisel Partners' experience,
expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with Scient's business. Thomas
Weisel Partners is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged

in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, Thomas Weisel Partners actively trades the equity securities of Scient
for its own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in these securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN IXL DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of iXL to vote
FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan, stockholders of iXL should be aware that members of the
iXL board of directors and members of iXL's management team have agreements or
arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that differ from and
are in addition to those of iXL stockholders. The iXL board of directors was
aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the
merits of the merger and in determining to recommend to the stockholders of iXL
that they vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement and FOR adoption of the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan.

(1) Based on market value as of August 23, 2001.

     All of the unvested iXL options issued under the 1996 Stock Option Plan or
the 1998 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan will terminate and be forfeited
immediately prior to the closing of the merger to the extent not exercised

by current iXL employees who will continue as employees of Holdco will be
replaced with options to purchase Holdco Common Stock at the closing of the
merger. All of the iXL options issued under the 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan
or 1999B Employee Stock Option Plan will be exchanged for options to purchase

     Indemnification and Insurance.  The merger agreement provides that, upon
completion of the merger, Holdco will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of iXL and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities:

     - to the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement
       of expenses as of July 31, 2001, which is the date of the merger
       agreement, pursuant to iXL's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
       indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of
       iXL and its subsidiaries; and

directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement
of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of iXL. In addition, upon completion of
the merger, Holdco will cause to be maintained, for a period of six years after
completion of the merger, the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by iXL, or
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured,
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the completion of the merger, although Holdco will not be required to expend in
any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
by iXL for directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance.

proxy statement describing the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. See "The

     Indemnification and Insurance.  The merger agreement provides that Holdco
shall include and caused to be maintained in its certificate of incorporation
and bylaws after the completion of the merger provisions regarding elimination
of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Scient. In addition, upon
completion of the merger, Holdco will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of Scient and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities:

     - to the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement
       of expenses as of July 31, 2001, which is the date of the merger
       agreement, pursuant to Scient's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
       indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of
       Scient and its subsidiaries; and

     - to the fullest extent permitted by law,

in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of
the merger.

     The merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the merger,
Holdco will cause to be maintained, for a period of six years after completion
of the merger, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Scient, or policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous

to the insured, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the completion of the merger, although Holdco will not be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Scient for directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or, to the extent legally permissible, waived,
including the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of iXL and
Scient. The merger will become effective upon the filing of certificates of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

     We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
expect to complete the merger during the fall of 2001.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF IXL AND SCIENT STOCK

     Structure.  To accomplish the combination of their businesses, iXL and
Scient jointly formed a new company, Holdco, with two subsidiaries, India Merger
Sub and Sierra Merger Sub. At the time the merger is completed:

     - iXL will be merged into India Merger Sub, and India Merger Sub will be
       the surviving corporation; and

     - Scient Merger Sub will be merged into Scient, and Scient will be the
       surviving corporation.

     As a result, iXL (through its successor corporation India Merger Sub) and
Scient will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

     Conversion of iXL and Scient Stock.  When the merger is completed:

     - iXL common stockholders will receive 0.25 shares of Holdco common stock
       for each share they own; and

     - Scient common stockholders will receive 0.31 shares of Holdco common
       stock for each share they own.

     The number of shares of Holdco stock issuable in the merger will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar event
with respect to the iXL common stock or Scient common stock effected between the
date of the merger agreement and the date of completion of the merger.

EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR HOLDCO STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering your iXL or Scient stock
certificates in exchange for statements indicating book-entry ownership of
Holdco common stock or, if requested, stock certificates. When you deliver your
iXL or Scient stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly
executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your stock
certificates will be canceled and you will receive statements indicating
book-entry ownership of Holdco common stock or, if requested, stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of Holdco stock to which you are entitled
under the merger agreement. iXL and Scient stockholders will receive payment in
cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdco common stock
which would have been otherwise issuable to them as a result of the merger.

     You should not submit your iXL or Scient stock certificates for exchange
until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

     You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Holdco common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
iXL or Scient stock certificates in exchange for Holdco stock certificates.

     If there is any dividend or other distribution on Holdco stock with a
record date after the date on which the merger is completed and a payment date
prior to the date you surrender your iXL or Scient stock certificates in
exchange for Holdco stock certificates, you will receive the dividend or
distribution with respect to the whole shares of Holdco stock issued to you
promptly after they are issued. If there is any dividend or other distribution
on Holdco stock with a record date after the date on which the merger is
completed and a payment date after the date you surrender your iXL or Scient
stock certificates in exchange for Holdco stock certificates, you will receive
the dividend or distribution with respect to the whole shares of Holdco stock
issued to you promptly after the payment date.

     Holdco will only issue a Holdco stock certificate or a check in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered iXL or
Scient stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent with
all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership
and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

TREATMENT OF IXL AND SCIENT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY BASED AWARDS

     iXL.  When the merger is completed:

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's Tessera 1995 Stock
       Option Plan shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent not exercised,
       provided that all unvested options under this plan shall accelerate and
       vest prior to the effective time of the merger;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's 1996 Stock Option
       Plan and 1998 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan shall terminate and be
       forfeited to the extent not exercised;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to iXL's 1999 Employee
       Stock Option Plan and 1999B Employee Stock Option Plan, whether or not
       then vested or exercisable, will automatically be exchanged for options
       to purchase the number of shares of Holdco common stock that is equal to
       the product of 0.25 multiplied by the number of shares of iXL common
       stock that would have been subject to the option before the merger,
       rounded down to the nearest whole share; the exercise price per share
       will be equal to the exercise price per share of iXL common stock subject
       to the option before the merger divided by 0.25; and

     - current iXL employees holding options issued under iXL's Tessera 1995
       Stock Option Plan or iXL's 1996 Stock Option Plan who will continue as
       employees of Holdco will receive options to purchase the number of shares
       of Holdco common stock that is equal to the product of 0.25 multiplied by
       the number of shares of iXL common stock that would have been subject to
       the option before the merger, rounded down to the nearest whole share;
       the exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per
       share of iXL common stock subject to the option before the merger divided
       by 0.25; the vesting schedules shall be identical to that of the
       forfeited iXL options as they existed immediately prior to the
       effectiveness of the merger.

     Scient.  When the merger is completed:

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 1997 Stock Plan
       will be cancelled in accordance with the plan, provided, however, all
       unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the merger;

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 1999 Equity
       Incentive Plan will expire in accordance with the plan, provided,
       however, all unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the
       merger; and

     - all outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Scient's 2000 Stock Plan
       will expire in accordance with the plan, provided, however, that all
       unvested options will accelerate and vest prior to the merger.

     Holdco.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will reserve for the
issuance of stock options to employees, directors and consultants of Holdco a
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the

merger. A large portion of these options will be granted immediately following
the merger in order to provide important retention incentives for employees.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following summary discusses certain material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of iXL and Scient stock.

     For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder means:

     - a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or
       organized under the laws of the United States or any political
       subdivision thereof;

     - a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
       administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the
       authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or

     - an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income
       regardless of its source.

     This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions
currently in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The discussion assumes that iXL stockholders hold their iXL
common stock and will hold their Holdco common stock, and that Scient
stockholders hold their Scient common stock and will hold their Holdco common
stock, as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in
light of his, her or its personal investment circumstances or to stockholders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,
but not limited to:

     - insurance companies;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currency;

     - banks or trusts;

     - persons that hold their iXL common stock or Scient common stock as part
       of a straddle, a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale or
       conversion transaction;

     - persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

     - investors in pass-through entities;

     - stockholders who acquired their iXL common stock or Scient common stock
       through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or through a
       tax-qualified retirement plan; or

     - holders of options granted under any iXL or Scient benefit plan.

     Furthermore, this discussion does not consider the potential effects of any
state, local or foreign tax laws.

     The mergers have been structured to qualify as tax-free transactions under
the Internal Revenue Code. The obligations of Scient to consummate the merger of
Sierra Merger Sub, Inc. into Scient is conditioned on the receipt by Scient of
an opinion from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to Scient, that the merger
relating to Scient will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The obligations of iXL to consummate the merger of iXL
into India Merger Sub, Inc. is conditioned on the receipt by iXL of an opinion
from Greenberg Traurig, LLP, counsel to iXL, that the merger relating to iXL
will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts, and the parties do not intend to request a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the mergers. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge such conclusion
or that a court will not sustain such challenge. Such

opinions shall be based on certain facts, assumptions and representations set
forth or referenced in such opinions. Assuming the mergers qualify as
reorganizations, the material tax consequences are as follows.

     Tax Consequences to Scient Shareholders.  U.S. Holders of Scient common
stock will not recognize gain, income, or loss upon the receipt of Holdco common
stock in exchange for their shares of Scient common stock, except with respect
to cash received by U.S. Holders of Scient common stock in lieu of fractional
shares of Holdco common stock. The tax basis of the shares of Holdco common
stock will be equal to the tax basis of the U.S. Holder's Scient common stock
exchanged for that Holdco common stock, reduced by any amount allocable to the
fractional share interests in Holdco common stock for which cash is received.
The holding period of the shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger
by a U.S. Holder of Scient common stock will include the holding period of the
U.S. Holder's Scient common stock surrendered therefor.

     Tax Consequences to iXL Shareholders.  U.S. Holders of iXL common stock
will not recognize gain, income, or loss upon the receipt of Holdco common stock
in exchange for their shares of iXL common stock, except with respect to cash
received by U.S. Holders of iXL common stock in lieu of fractional shares of
Holdco common stock. The tax basis of the shares of Holdco common stock will be
equal to the tax basis of the U.S. Holder's iXL common stock exchanged for that
Holdco common stock, reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share
interests in Holdco common stock for which cash is received. The holding period
of the shares of Holdco common stock received in the merger by a U.S. Holder of
iXL common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. Holder's iXL common
stock surrendered therefor.

     Tax Consequences to Scient and iXL.  No gain, income, or loss will be
recognized by Scient or iXL pursuant to the mergers.

     Copies of these opinions are attached as exhibits 8.1 and 8.2 to the
registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus forms a part.
Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or
failure of any factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and
complete in all material respects, could affect the continuing validity of the
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, tax opinion and the Davis Polk & Wardwell tax opinion.

     Cash Instead of Fractional Shares.  The receipt of cash instead of a
fractional share of Holdco common stock by a U.S. Holder of iXL or Scient common
stock will result in taxable gain or loss to such U.S. Holder for U.S. federal
income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash
received by such U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the
fractional share as set forth above. The gain or loss will constitute capital
gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder's holding period is greater than 12 months as of the date of the merger.
For non-corporate U.S. Holders, this long-term capital gain generally will be
taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

     Backup Withholding.  Certain non-corporate iXL and Scient stockholders may
be subject to backup withholding on cash payments received instead of fractional
shares of Holdco capital stock. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to
an iXL or Scient stockholder who:

     - furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he,
       she or it is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9
       or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered
       to iXL and Scient stockholders following the date of completion of the
       merger;

     - provides a certification of foreign status on Form W-8 or successor form;
       or

     - is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

     The amount of backup withholding from a payment of cash instead of
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock will be allowed as a credit against
such U.S. Holder's federal tax liability and may entitle you to a refund,
provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

     Reporting Requirements.  A U.S. Holder of iXL common stock or Scient common
stock receiving Holdco common stock as a result of the merger may be required to
retain records related to such U.S.

Holder's iXL common stock and Scient common stock, as the case may be, and file
with its federal income tax return, a statement setting forth facts relating to
the merger.

     This summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are
contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, the summary does not address
any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the
merger. The summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction
other than the merger. Accordingly, each iXL and Scient stockholder is strongly
urged to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state,
local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the merger to the holder.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     We intend to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations. iXL will be deemed the purchaser of Scient's business
for accounting purposes. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements."

REGULATORY MATTERS

     iXL and Scient are not aware of any governmental approvals or actions that
are required to complete the merger. iXL and Scient conduct operations in a
number of foreign countries, some of which have voluntary and/or post-merger
notification systems. Should any approval or action be required, iXL and Scient
currently plan to seek such approval or take such action. Failure to obtain such
approval or take such action is not anticipated to have a material effect on the
merger or on Holdco.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF IXL AND SCIENT

     The offer and sale of shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Holdco common stock
issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either iXL or Scient
at the time of the special meetings. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
the common control of either iXL or Scient and may include our executive
officers and directors, as well as our significant stockholders. Affiliates may
not sell their shares of Holdco common stock acquired in connection with the
merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     Holdco's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement-prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Holdco
common stock to be received by our affiliates in the merger; however, Holdco has
agreed to register the shares of stock received by affiliates in the merger
pursuant to a registration rights agreement. See "-- Registration Rights
Agreement."

NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LISTING OF HOLDCO COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     The merger agreement requires Holdco to use its best efforts to cause the
shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official notice of issuance,
before the completion of the merger. Each of iXL's and Scient's obligation to
complete the merger is subject to the condition that this approval is obtained.
See "-- The Merger Agreement."

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, iXL stockholders and Scient stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger because the common stock of each
of iXL and Scient is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the shares of common
stock of

Holdco which the stockholders of iXL and Scient will receive in the merger will
be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF IXL AND SCIENT COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, iXL common stock and Scient common stock will
each be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and will be deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     - Scient must have:

         and

      -- any failure of such representations and warranties to be true and

       purposes the merger relating to Scient will constitute a reorganization

     "Material Adverse Effect," when used in reference to any entity, means any
material adverse effect on:

     - the business, assets (including cash), financial performance, condition
       (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of such entity and its
       subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any event, change,
       circumstance or effect relating:

      -- to the economy or financial markets in general;

      -- in general to the industries in which such entity operates and not
         specifically relating to (or having the effect of specifically relating
         to or having a materially disproportionate effect (relative to most
         other industry participants) on) such entity; or

      -- to the actions taken by the transition and succession team to the
         extent and in the manner specified in the merger agreement; or

     - the ability of such entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by
       the merger agreement.

     No Other Transactions Involving iXL or Scient.  The merger agreement
contains detailed provisions prohibiting iXL and Scient from seeking an
alternative transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions, each of iXL
and Scient has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, officers or
directors, will not, and that it will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
its and its subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives, (including
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors) do
not, directly or indirectly:

     - initiate, solicit, induce, encourage or knowingly facilitate the making
       or receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, as described below; or

     - have any discussion with, or provide (by any medium) any material
       non-public information or data to, any person relating to an Acquisition
       Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition
       Proposal, or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
       Acquisition Proposal.

     "Acquisition Proposal" means, with respect to iXL or Scient, other than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer or proposal for, or
any indication of interest, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term
sheet or inquiry relating to:

     - a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
       combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
       transaction involving it or any of its significant subsidiaries;

     - any transfer, lease, assignment, exchange, purchase or sale of 15% or
       more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its subsidiaries) of
       such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

     - any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, any equity or
       voting debt securities of such party, which if consummated, would result
       in any person beneficially owning any securities representing 15% or more
       of the outstanding voting power of such party (or of the surviving,
       resulting or ultimate parent entity in such transaction) or any of its
       significant subsidiaries.

     However, the merger agreement does not prevent each of iXL and Scient or
their respective board of directors from engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with, or providing(by any medium) material, non-public data or
information to, any person in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal by that person, but if and only to the extent that:

     - its stockholders have not voted to adopt the merger agreement;

     - its Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with
       independent outside counsel and independent financial advisors that such
       Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
       Proposal (as described below);

     - prior to providing any information or data to any person in connection
       with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, its Board of Directors
       receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement having
       provisions that are customary in such agreements relative to proposed
       transactions such as the Acquisition Proposal, as advised by outside
       counsel, provided that if such confidentiality agreement contains
       provisions that are less restrictive than the comparable provision, or
       omits restrictive provisions, contained in the confidentiality agreement
       between iXL and Scient, then the confidentiality agreement between iXL
       and Scient will be deemed to be amended to contain the less restrictive
       provisions or to omit the restrictive provisions (as the case may be);
       and

     - prior to providing any material, non-public data or information or data
       to any person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
       person, such party notifies the other party promptly (and, in any case,
       within 24 hours) of inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
       information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
       sought to be initiated or continued with, such person or any of its
       representatives, indicating the name of the person and the material terms
       and conditions of any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals, term
       sheets or offers.

     "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made to iXL or
Scient, as the case may be,

     - regarding a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
       business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
       iXL or Scient as a result of which the person making the proposal or its
       stockholders would own a majority of the combined voting power of the
       entity surviving or resulting from the transaction, or its ultimate
       parent entity;

     - which is on terms which the board of directors of iXL or Scient, as the
       case may be, in good faith concludes, following receipt of the advice of
       its financial advisors and outside counsel, taking into account, among
       other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
       proposal and the person making the proposal would, if completed, result
       in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of iXL or
       Scient, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the
       merger; and

     - which provides that any requisite external financing is either then
       committed or otherwise funded and not subject to any material
       contingency.

     In addition, if either iXL or Scient makes a Change in Board
Recommendation, as defined below, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
then it will

     - provide immediate written notice to the other party of the Change in
       Board Recommendation specifying the identity of the person making the
       Acquisition Proposal, as well as the material terms of the Acquisition
       Proposal; and

     - postpone or delay its stockholders meeting to be held for the purpose of
       voting on the merger agreement for not less than five days after such
       written notice is provided to the other party.

     "Change in Board Recommendation" means, with respect to any party to the
merger agreement:

     - withdrawing, modifying or qualifying, or proposing to withdraw, modify or
       qualify, in any manner adverse to the other party to the merger
       agreement, the recommendation of that party's board of directors that its
       stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - taking any action or making any statement in connection with the special
       meeting of the stockholders of that party that is inconsistent with the
       recommendation of that party's board of directors.

     Each of iXL and Scient has agreed under the provisions of the merger
agreement that:

     - it will promptly keep the other party informed of the status and terms of
       any proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations covered by the "no
       solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement;

     - it will, and its officers, directors and representatives will,
       immediately cease and terminate any activities, discussions or
       negotiations existing as of July 31, 2001, the date of the merger
       agreement, with any parties conducted before that date with respect to
       any Acquisition Proposal;

     - it will promptly inform its directors, officers, key employees, agents
       and representatives of the obligations of the "no solicitation"
       provisions of the merger agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to
       obtain their express acknowledgment of the terms of the "no solicitation"
       provisions; and

     - it will not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition
       Proposal other than the merger between iXL and Scient.

     Nothing contained in the "no solicitation" provisions of the merger
agreement will:

     - permit iXL or Scient to terminate the merger agreement, except as
       specifically provided in the merger agreement; or

     - affect any other obligation of iXL or Scient under the merger agreement.

     Termination.  iXL and Scient can terminate the merger agreement by mutual
written consent at any time. Either company may also terminate the merger
agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed on or before December 31, 2001; however, this
       date may be extended to no earlier than March 31, 2002 if the
       registration statement of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus is
       a part has not yet been declared effective by the SEC, and neither
       company may terminate pursuant to this provision if its willful failure
       to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause
       of or resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed by such date;

     - any governmental entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
       taken any action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
       merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
       final and nonappealable, except that this right to terminate the merger
       agreement shall not be available to any party who has been the cause of
       such action;

     - either company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement
       at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders;

     - the board of directors of the other party fails to recommend that the
       stockholders of that party vote for the adoption of the merger agreement
       or effects a Change in Board Recommendation, whether or not permitted by
       the terms of the merger agreement;

     - the other party fails to notice and convene a special meeting of its
       stockholders to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - the other party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
       warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger
       agreement in such a way as to render the conditions to the completion of
       the merger relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties and
       the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants contained
       in the merger agreement incapable of being satisfied on or before
       December 31, 2001 or such later date agreed to by the parties as
       described above.

     Termination Fee.  The merger agreement entitles each of iXL and Scient to a
$7,500,000 termination fee from the other party if it terminates the merger
agreement because:

     - the board of directors of the other party shall have failed to recommend
       that its stockholders approve the merger, effected a Change in Board
       Recommendation, or failed to notice and convene a special meeting of its
       stockholders to vote on adoption of the merger agreement; or

     - the approval of the merger by the other party's stockholders is not
       obtained, if prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with
       respect to the other party has been publicly announced or otherwise
       communicated publicly to the senior management, representatives, board of
       directors or stockholders of the other party.

  Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.

     Transition Team.  The merger agreement requires iXL and Scient to
reasonably cooperate in the formation of a transition and succession team
comprised of an equal number of representatives of each of iXL and Scient for
the purpose of establishing goals and programs, and implementing same, in
furtherance of the long-term strategic prospects, goals and objectives of
Holdco. To be effective, any action undertaken by such transition and succession
team shall require the affirmative approval of at least one representative of
each of iXL and Scient.

     Restrictions on Conduct of Business.  Under the merger agreement, each of
iXL and Scient has agreed that, during the period before completion of the
merger, it will carry on its respective business in the usual, regular and
ordinary course in all material respects, in substantially the same manner as
previously conducted, and will use its reasonable best efforts to preserve
intact its present line of business, maintain its rights and franchises and
preserve its relationships with third parties to the end that its ongoing
business shall not be impaired in any material respect at the completion of the
merger. Each of iXL and Scient has also agreed that it will not, and it will not
permit any of its subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions, enter into any
new material line of business or incur or commit to any capital expenditures or
any obligations or liabilities in connection with such capital expenditures,
other than as previously disclosed to the other party or in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice.

     In addition to these agreements regarding the conduct of business
generally, each of iXL and Scient has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to
some specific restrictions relating to, among other things, the following:

     - the declaration or payment of dividends;

     - the alteration of share capital, including, among other things, stock
       splits, combinations or reclassifications;

       securities;

     - the taking of actions that would prevent or impede the merger from
       qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
       Code;

     - compensation of directors, executive officers and key employees;

     - accounting policies and procedures;

     - entrance into agreements that limit or restrict, or after completion of
       the merger, could limit or restrict iXL, Scient or any of their
       subsidiaries or affiliates, including Holdco, from engaging or competing
       in any line of business or in any geographic area; and

     - actions that would result, or would reasonably be expected to result, in
       any of the conditions to the merger not being satisfied, or a material
       delay in the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the merger.

     Additional Agreements.  Each of iXL and Scient has agreed to cooperate with
each other and to use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all
things necessary, proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable
laws to complete the merger as soon as practicable after July 31, 2001, which is
the date of the merger agreement. Accordingly, each has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to:

     - as promptly as practicable, prepare and file all applications, notices,
       petitions, filings and other documents, and to obtain all consents,
       waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings,
       authorizations and clearances from any third party or any domestic or
       foreign governmental entity necessary to complete the merger; and

     - take all reasonable steps to obtain all necessary consents and required
       approvals, including those required under applicable antitrust laws.

     The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to, among other
things, the cooperation between iXL and Scient in the preparation of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus and additional agreements between them relating to
access to information, mutual notice of specified matters and public
announcements.

     Amendment, Extension and Waiver.  The merger agreement may be amended by
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the merger by the
stockholders of iXL and Scient has been obtained. After the stockholder
approvals have been obtained, however, no amendment may be made which by law or
in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market requires further
approval by the stockholders of iXL or Scient, as the case may be, without such
further approval. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing and
signed by each party.

     At any time before the completion of the merger, the parties may, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, to the extent
legally allowed:

     - extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
       acts of the other parties;

     - waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
       the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger
       agreement; and

       the merger agreement.

     All extensions and waivers must be in writing and signed by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

     Expenses.  Whether or not the merger is completed, all expenses and fees
incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger will be paid by
the party incurring the expenses or fees, except:

     - if the merger is completed, Holdco shall pay, or cause to be paid, any
       and all expenses incurred by iXL and Scient; and

     - irrespective of whether the merger is consummated, iXL and Scient shall
       share equally:

registration under the Securities Act of the offer and sale of the common stock
held by such affiliates; provided, however, upon the existence of certain
circumstances, Holdco may delay a demand for registration for a specified
period. Each demand for registration must be made by affiliates holding at least
10% of the common stock held by all such affiliates. Additionally, if Holdco is
at any time eligible to register the common stock held by the affiliates on Form

SCIENT, INC. 2001 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

     The following summary of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the equity
incentive plan, which is incorporated by reference and attached as

Annex I to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. We urge you to read the full
text of such equity incentive plan.

     General.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to comply
with the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Holdco's board of directors believes that in order for Holdco to attract, retain
and reward valuable personnel it is important for Holdco to adopt a flexible,
long-term incentive plan.

     Purpose.  The purpose of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is to
promote the long-term success of Holdco and the creation of stockholder value by
encouraging employees, directors and consultants to focus on critical long-range
objectives, encouraging the attraction and retention of employees, directors and
consultants with exceptional qualifications and linking such individuals
directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership.

     Shares Available for Grants.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan
will reserve for issuance of stock incentives to employees, directors and
consultants of Holdco a number of shares equal to 25% of the number of Holdco
common stock outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger. In
addition, as of January 1 of each year, commencing with the year 2002, the
aggregate number of shares underlying awards which may be granted under the plan
will automatically increase by a number equal to the lesser of 8% of the total
number of Holdco common stock then outstanding or (b) 10 million; provided that
the number of shares of Holdco common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to
the plan does not exceed 25% of the number of Holdco common stock outstanding as
of such January 1.

     No participant may receive stock options and/or stock appreciation rights
in any calendar year that relate to more than [______] shares, except that a
newly hired employee may receive options and/or stock appreciation rights
covering up to [______] shares. If awards granted under the plan are forfeited
or otherwise terminated, then the shares subject to those awards will again
become available for issuance under the plan. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
aggregate number of shares of Holdco common stock that may be issued under the
plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options will be [______] and may not
be increased when shares of restricted stock or other awards are forfeited.

     Substitute awards granted in assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding awards previously granted by a company which Holdco or an affiliate
acquires or with which Holdco or an affiliate combines, will not reduce the
number of shares available for issuance the plan.

     Administration.  The Holdco compensation committee will administer the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. The committee will have complete
discretion to make all decisions relating to the interpretation and operation of
the plan. Specifically, the committee will have the discretion to select the
employees and consultants who are to receive options under the plan, determine
the type, number, vesting requirements and other features and conditions of such
options, interpret the plan and make all other decisions relating to the
operation of the plan. The committee will also be permitted to reprice
outstanding options and modify outstanding options in other ways. In addition,
the committee will have the authority within the plan limits to establish
sub-plans if required to be in compliance with non-U.S. laws.

     Eligibility.  All employees, directors and consultants of Holdco and its
affiliates will be eligible to participate in the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan; provided that incentive stock options will be limited to common
law employees of Holdco, a parent or a subsidiary.

     Types of Awards.  The Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan provides for
the following types of awards: incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units.

     Terms of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.  An optionee who exercises
an incentive stock option may qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code. On the other hand, nonstatutory stock options
do not qualify for such favorable tax treatment. The exercise price for all
incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the plan
will be at least 100% of the fair market

value of Holdco common stock on the option grant date. The exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options may be as low as the par value of the underlying
shares of Holdco common stock.

     Optionees will be permitted to pay the exercise price by using cash; shares
of Holdco common stock that the optionee already owns; a full-recourse
promissory note, except that the par value of newly issued shares must be paid
in cash; an immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by
us; or a loan from a broker designated by us, secured by the option shares.

     Options and stock appreciation rights will vest at the time or times
determined by the compensation committee. In most cases, the options will vest
over the four-year period following the date of grant.

     Options will generally expire 10 years after they are granted, except that
they will generally expire earlier if the optionee's service terminates earlier.

     Restricted Shares and Stock Units.  Restricted shares may be awarded under
the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan in return for cash; a full-recourse
promissory note, except that the par value of newly issued shares must be paid
in cash; services already provided to Holdco; and in the case of treasury shares
only, services to be provided to Holdco in the future.

     Restricted shares and stock units vest at the time or times determined by
the Holdco compensation committee.

     Change in Control.  If a change in control of Holdco occurs, an option or
other award granted under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan will
generally become fully vested, unless the surviving company assumes the option
or other award or replaces it with a comparable award. In addition, an option or
other award will ordinarily become vested in full -- even if it was assumed or
replaced -- if the participant is discharged within 12 months after the change
in control other than for cause. For this purpose, a participant is also treated
as having been discharged other than for cause if the participant resigns after
being asked to relocate, after suffering a reduction in compensation or after
being demoted.

     A change in control includes a merger of Holdco after which Holdco's
stockholders own 50% or less of the surviving company; a sale of all or
substantially all of Holdco's assets; a proxy contest that results in the
replacement of more than one-half of Holdco's directors over a 24-month period;
or an acquisition of 30% or more of Holdco's outstanding stock by any person or
group, other than a person related to Holdco, such as a holding company owned by
Holdco's stockholders.

     Automatic Grants to Non-Employee Directors.  The non-employee members of
Holdco's board of directors are eligible for automatic option grants under the
Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Each non-employee director will receive
options for 5,000 shares of Holdco common stock each calendar quarter. These
options will be exercisable immediately after the grant, and the option shares
will be fully vested from the outset. The exercise price of each non-employee
director's option will be equal to the fair market value of Holdco common stock
on the option grant date. A director will be able to pay the exercise price by
using cash, shares of common stock that the director already owns or an
immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by Holdco. The
non-employee directors' options will have a 10-year term, except that they will
expire one year after a director leaves the Holdco board, if earlier.

     Adjustment.  All share amounts under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan, including shares reserved for issuance and the maximum number of shares
covered by options or stock appreciation rights granted to any participant in a
calendar year, are subject to proportionate adjustment upon stock splits, stock
dividends and the like; provided, however, that the quarterly options for
non-employee directors of 5,000 shares are not subject to adjustment.

     Amendment or Termination.  The Holdco board of directors may amend or
terminate the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan at any time. If the board
amends the plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the
amendment unless applicable law requires it. The plan will continue in effect
for 10 years after the completion of the merger, unless the board decides to
terminate the plan earlier.

     New Plan Benefits.  Awards under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan are discretionary. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the
allocation of all of the benefits that will be received in the future by
participants in the plan. It is anticipated that following the completion of the
merger, the following options to purchase Holdco common stock will be granted
under the plan to the directors and officers of Holdco:

     Summary of Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of
Awards.  The following is the current, general U.S. federal income tax
consequences of awards that may be granted under the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan. It is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all
possible tax consequences related to awards under the plan.

     Neither the participant nor Holdco will incur any federal tax consequences
as a result of the grant of an option or a stock appreciation right. The
participant will have no taxable income upon exercising an incentive stock
option (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply), and Holdco will
receive no deduction when an incentive stock option is exercised. Upon
exercising a nonstatutory stock option or a stock appreciation right, the
participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the "spread"
between the exercise price and the fair market value of Holdco common stock on
the date of exercise; Holdco will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction for the
same amount.

     The tax treatment of a disposition of shares acquired upon exercise of an
option depends on how long the shares have been held and on whether the shares
were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option or by exercising a
nonstatutory stock option. Holdco will not be entitled to a deduction in
connection with a disposition of option shares, except in the case of a
disposition of shares acquired under an incentive stock option before the
applicable holding periods have been satisfied.

     In the case of awards other than options and stock appreciation rights, the
participant will generally be taxed as ordinary income equal to the fair market
of the shares, cash or other property received. This tax will accrue at the time
of grant, except in the case of an award that is non-transferable and subject to
a risk of forfeiture. In that case, the tax may not accrue until lapse of at
least one of these restrictions, although the participant may elect to be taxed
at the time of grant. Subject to an exception discussed below under
"-- Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code," Holdco will be
entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income taxed to
the participant.

     Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Holdco
compensation committee intends that some awards under the Scient, Inc. 2001
Equity Incentive Plan should qualify as performance-based, as defined in Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) imposes a cap of $1 million
on the amount of tax deductions that an employer may take for compensation to
any particular

executive in a single year, but qualifying performance-based compensation
remains fully deductible regardless of its amount. Under the plan, options and
stock appreciation rights are intended to qualify as performance-based
compensation.

     By approving the plan, stockholders will also be approving the eligibility
of executive officers and others to participate in the plan and the per-person
limitations for performance-based awards. The plan imposes per-person
limitations so that a participant may not receive awards intended to qualify as
performance-based in excess of his or her annual limit. The annual limit has
been set above the committee's present anticipated award levels because Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code permits only downward discretionary
adjustments.

     A number of other requirements must be met in order for a particular
compensation to qualify as performance-based under Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code. There can be no assurances that compensation resulting
from awards granted under the plan intended to qualify as performance-based
will, in fact, be fully deductible under all circumstances. In addition, the
plan authorizes types of awards that will not qualify as performance-based.
Compensation paid as a result of these awards may be subject to the limitation
on deductibility under Section 162(m) if it and other non-performance-based
compensation paid to any named executive officer exceed $1 million in a given
year. The committee's policy will be to preserve corporate tax deductions
attributable to the compensation of executives while maintaining the flexibility
to approve, when appropriate, compensation arrangements which it deems to be in
the best interests of Holdco and its stockholders, but which may not always
qualify for full tax deductibility under Section 162(m).

     Stockholder approval of the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan is
being sought in order to qualify for certain regulatory and tax benefits under
Nasdaq Stock Market rules, Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Sections 162(m)
and 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. If stockholders do not approve the plan,
it will not be adopted.

     The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by iXL
stockholders and the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by
Scient stockholders are required to adopt the Scient, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
Plan.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are presented to illustrate the effects of the merger on the historical
financial position and operating results of iXL and Scient. iXL and Scient have
different fiscal years. iXL has a December 31 year-end while Scient has a March
31 year-end. It is anticipated that Holdco will have a December 31 year-end. The
twelve-month unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are
presented using iXL's results for the year ended December 31, 2000 and Scient's
results for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001. The interim period unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are presented using both
iXL's and Scient's results for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Therefore,
Scient's results for the three months ended March 31, 2001 are included in both
the twelve-month and interim unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements
of operations. Revenue and net loss for Scient for the three months ended March
31, 2001 were $27.1 million and $90.2 million, respectively.

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at June
30, 2001 gives effect to the merger as if it occurred as of that date. The
following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give
effect to the merger as if it occurred as of January 1, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are
presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have actually occurred if
the merger had been in effect on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of Holdco. The pro
forma adjustments are based on the information and assumptions available at the
time of the printing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Although
estimates are preliminary, management does not believe the actual results will
differ significantly.

THE MERGER

     The merger will be structured as a stock-for-stock exchange and is
described under "The Merger -- Structure of the Merger and Conversion of iXL and
Scient Stock."

     As a result of the merger, it is anticipated that the former stockholders
of iXL will have an approximate 50% interest in Holdco and that the former
stockholders of Scient will have an approximate 50% interest in Holdco. The
merger is expected to be accounted for as an acquisition by iXL of Scient under
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, as covered by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations."

     Management expects that the strategic benefits of the merger will result in
cost saving opportunities for the combined company. Those opportunities include,
but are not limited to, the ability to reduce real estate lease costs and
administrative costs. However, such incremental cost savings have not been
reflected in the accompanying pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations of Holdco.

                   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1. The purchase price of the merger was based on the number of common
shares outstanding of Scient that would be converted into Holdco shares based
upon the agreed ratio as of July 31, 2001. Scient has options outstanding that
will vest and be available to exercise upon consummation of the merger. All
options not exercised by closing will be cancelled. A significant portion of the
Scient options outstanding are out of the money. While it is likely that those
options in the money at the time of the closing will be exercised, there is no
way to estimate the ultimate number of Holdco shares that will be issued in
conjunction with any exercised options. Because the number of options that will
ultimately be exercised cannot be determined at this time, no adjustment for the
possible increase in the purchase price of Scient due to increased number of
shares outstanding is included in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet
as of June 30, 2001. Management does not believe the effects resulting from any
differences in the final allocation of the purchase price will differ
significantly from the estimates used herein.

     The purchase price and allocation used in preparation of these pro forma
statements were computed as follows:

PURCHASE PRICE (IN THOUSANDS):
Cost of acquired entity.....................................  $62,513(a)
Acquisition expenses (estimated)............................    7,356(b)
                                                              -------
Total purchase price........................................  $69,869
                                                              =======
PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE (IN THOUSANDS):
Fair value of Scient net assets at June 30, 2001............  $73,543
Excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost of
  acquired entity...........................................   (3,674)(c)
                                                              -------
Total purchase price........................................  $69,869
                                                              =======

- ---------------

a. The cost of the acquired entity is based on the outstanding shares of Scient
   as of July 31, 2001. The number of shares has been converted to an equivalent
   number of iXL shares and valued based on the average closing stock price for
   the period two days prior and two days after the July 31, 2001 merger
   announcement.
b. Total transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the merger are
   estimated to be approximately $7.4 million. These costs are presented as an
   adjustment to accrued liabilities in the unaudited pro forma condensed
   combined balance sheet. These costs are related to legal, printing,
   accounting, financial advisory services and other expenses. Other expenses
   include approximately $1.2 million of exit costs to be incurred in connection
   with the merger, such as a reduction in workforce.
c. The $3.7 million amount represents the excess of fair value of net assets
   acquired over cost and has been reallocated to property and equipment through
   a pro forma adjustment, resulting in a decrease in the property and equipment
   balance in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and a decrease in
   depreciation expense in the pro forma condensed combined income statements.

     2. Pro forma adjustments to record the merger as of June 30, 2001 represent
an increase in common stock resulting from the issuance of Holdco shares offset
by the elimination of Scient's existing common stock and a corresponding
decrease in additional paid in capital and unearned compensation resulting from
the elimination of Scient's existing additional paid in capital and unearned
compensation, offset by the cost of the acquired entity in excess of the par
value of the common stock.

     3. The pro forma combined weighted average common shares outstanding amount
for all periods presented is based on the estimated number of shares outstanding
after iXL stockholders and Scient stockholders have received their respective
0.25 and 0.31 shares in Holdco. Scient has options outstanding that will vest
and be available to exercise upon consummation of the merger. Because the number
of options that will ultimately be exercised cannot be determined at this time,
no adjustment to weighted shares outstanding has been made.

     4. Certain financial statement balances of Scient have been reclassified to
conform with iXL's financial statement presentation.

                                  IXL BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     iXL is a leading business and technology consultancy that helps companies
utilize emerging technologies and business strategy designed to build stronger,
more profitable relationships with their customers and business partners. iXL
has 7 principal offices in the United States and Europe. iXL began operations in
May 1996, and since that time iXL has acquired a total of 38 companies.

     iXL's goal is to be the leader in providing unique e-business solutions for
Global 1000 companies and other corporate users of information technology. To
achieve its goal, iXL seeks to utilize a focused set of vertical market
capabilities and cost-effective development and implementation resources. iXL
intends to leverage and expand its industry expertise, capture and disseminate
knowledge and best practices, recruit, train and retain experienced
professionals, expand client relationships and leverage strategic alliances with
key technology companies.

     iXL derives its revenue from fees for services for the design and delivery
of e-business solutions. These solutions typically include Web-based
applications, many of which integrate with a client's existing computer systems.
These solutions can incorporate multiple capabilities, including business
strategy consulting; creative design; information architecture; software
engineering; project management; and audio, video and animation production. iXL
offers its services on a time and materials and fixed-price basis.

     iXL typically staffs engagements with a multi-disciplined team of
professionals including, for example, project managers, strategic consultants,
creative designers, information architects, industry experts and software
engineers. By assembling these multi-disciplined teams of professionals, iXL
provides comprehensive e-business solutions to its clients. iXL utilizes a
proprietary engagement methodology called iD5, which defines and delineates
business procedures and processes to take full advantage of best practices
developed throughout iXL. iD5 governs and directs all phases of project
management from initial engagement definition to final solutions delivery. The
goal of iD5 is to provide consistent procedures for all engagement phases by
encouraging the use of best practices, while providing clients with greater
clarity of expectations, regular progress reports and a higher degree of project
organization. iXL believes iD5 helps it achieve on-time and on-budget solutions,
capture best practices and leverage its industry expertise.

     iXL uses its extensive engineering capabilities to deliver complex
e-business solutions by employing proven technologies such as Java, XML, Perl,
CGI, C and C++. iXL has also entered into an agreement with HPS America, Inc.
Under this agreement, HPS will complement and supplement iXL's existing core
engineering capabilities with its expertise in e-commerce, Web technology, rapid
application development, re-engineering and migration, legacy system maintenance
and enterprise integration.

     iXL's growth and its ability to provide e-business services depend in large
part on iXL's ability to recruit, train and retain experienced professionals.
iXL's strategy is to expand its existing expertise by recruiting senior
professionals from major consulting firms, creative design firms, information
technology services firms and other e-business services companies. iXL maintains
an informal, team-driven and results-oriented culture that is attractive to
energetic, talented professionals and provides incentives for iXL employees
through a competitive compensation plan, equity ownership and our stock option
plans.

     iXL is a Delaware corporation. iXL's principal executive offices are
located at 1600 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, and its telephone

on new engagements, improving efficiency of implementation and reducing project
delivery times.

SERVICE LINES

     iXL has organized its solution delivery around six service lines: Business
to Employee, E-Commerce/ Core Engineering, Strategy, Enterprise Relationship
Management, E-Value Chain and User Experience.

  Strategy

     iXL offers its clients, leading national and multinational businesses, a
single source for the comprehensive range of solutions required to identify,
design, develop and deploy e-business solutions that complement or expand
conventional business processes. iXL's strategy services combine innovative
strategic thinking, creative design capabilities, change management and
technological expertise to identify and develop innovative solutions.

  Business to Employee

     iXL's B2E group currently has three primary offerings: Knowledge
Management, eLearning and eHR and Employee Portals. The focus for these
solutions is to increase employee productivity and effectiveness. Together,
these solutions provide the basis for a powerful differentiator for iXL in
developing and winning eValue and ERM opportunities, as well as large enterprise
client engagements.

     iXL's B2E group has been named the strategic services partner for Cisco's
E-Learning Eco-system. Through this partnership, iXL will work with Cisco to
provide reference architecture and set solutions built on Cisco technologies.
Together iXL and Cisco will offer a number of knowledge management and learning
tools for large-scale enterprise solutions, including:

     - a means for employees to update their skill sets and job knowledge;

     - an efficient channel for sharing and disseminating information;

     - content creation and reuse;

     - increased employee productivity and reduced operational costs; and

     - delivery technologies including interactive multimedia, content on
       demand, virtual classroom, learning management and streaming media.

  E-Commerce/Core Engineering

     iXL designs, develops and deploys sophisticated e-commerce applications for
bringing buyers and sellers together via the Internet. iXL has created a broad
range of e-commerce applications for its clients, ranging from online retail
sites to electronic procurement systems. iXL's strength in e-commerce lies in
its ability to integrate third-party software with a client's existing computing
and network infrastructure to create a robust e-commerce environment for the
client's customers and prospects. iXL's technology group utilizes a set of core
e-commerce enabling technologies from companies, including:

     - Microsoft and BEA, for e-commerce server;

     - Oracle, for database platform development; and

     - Compaq and Sun Microsystems, for computing platforms and networking
       products and services.

     iXL has created its own e-commerce applications for specific client needs.
iXL also works with many third-party software companies that have developed more
general applications for conducting different aspects of e-commerce, ranging
from security to online transaction payments processing. iXL's E-Commerce/Core
Engineering service line also features specialized skills in E-Globalization.
E-Globalization is the process that enables a company to deliver products and
services to customers internationally. iXL works with clients to prepare
Internet-related business strategies and processes to handle international
inquiries, orders and customer support. Technology internationalization is the
creation or modification of software code, or HTML, to support information
processing in multiple locales, languages, currencies, calendars and other
differing data types. iXL assists clients in assessing the readiness of their
technology systems for globalization and localization. Technology localization
is the adaptation of a product or service to the legal, cultural, linguistic and
technical requirements of a particular market.

  Enterprise Relationship Management

     iXL designs and develops sophisticated computer-based business information
management systems. These include database-driven web sites that help clients
manage their customer, supplier and vendor relationships more effectively and
provide secure database access. Some of these web sites also have the capacity
to recognize and profile the types of information a user is typically interested
in, and to provide that information automatically to the user during future
visits to the site. As part of its ERM capability, iXL develops intranets and
extranets, which enable iXL's clients to communicate with employees, customers,
suppliers and vendors, as well as to track and store critical business data and
other information.

  E-Value Chain

     iXL's e-Value Chain group designs, builds and manages integrated trading
partner communities. iXL works with clients to develop solutions that provide
the ability to create, manage, maintain and optimize relationships with their
partners and suppliers across the entire Value Chain. iXL's e-Value Chain
practice provides strategic analysis and solutions to clients including
strategy, demand planning and order management,

procurement, technology, marketplaces for trading communities and supply chain
transformation and optimization.

  User Experience

     iXL's User Experience group builds a customized bridge between every client
and its customers. iXL's User Experience team is composed of experts in creative
strategy, branding strategy, content strategy and management, design,
information architecture, site authoring and usability engineering. Excellence
in quality and innovation in delivery are iXL's dominant drivers, allowing each
customer a unique and compelling experience.

SALES AND MARKETING

     iXL's marketing department has overall responsibility for communications,
advertising, public relations and iXL's World Wide Web site. iXL's sales &
marketing activities are aligned with iXL's vertical industry groups.

     Industry-aligned sales and marketing professionals are responsible for
developing new business within each industry, targeting new clients and
supporting the growth of existing client relationships. iXL's sales approach is
consultative and involves industry and solution experts who understand the
client's specific business and technology issues. Senior client executives are
assigned to strategic accounts to support and expand follow-on business.

     iXL's sales and marketing strategy is to leverage its industry expertise,
engineering, and technology skills to attract new clients and expand the scope
of existing client relationships into broader engagements, and to create and
sustain preference and loyalty for the iXL brand as a leading provider of
e-business solutions and services.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND AFFILIATIONS

     iXL has entered into, and intends to continue entering into, strategic
alliances and affiliations with a select group of technology service providers.
The primary goals of iXL's strategic alliances and affiliations are:

     - to train and retain iXL's engineers, architects, creative talent and
       strategists;

     - to create or identify new revenue opportunities through referrals and the
       creation of new service offerings; and

     - to increase iXL's credibility and visibility in the marketplace by
       operating an industry-leading alliances program as well as collaborating
       with alliance partners in joint marketing efforts.

     iXL has established strategic affiliations with, among others, Cisco,
Compaq, EMC, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Sun Microsystems. These strategic
affiliations provide iXL early access to training, product support, tools, best
practices and technology for these core elements of IT infrastructure. iXL has
also established strategic alliances with companies offering technologies that
serve specific roles in the deployment or delivery of iXL services. These
alliances are arranged by portfolios that focus on a particular solution set or
service line. Some of the portfolios and representative alliance partner
companies include Art Technology Group, BEA, Blue Martini, BroadVision,
Documentum, Interwoven, Vignette, Epicentric, Epiphany, Kana, Siebel and Ariba.
The contracts governing the strategic affiliations and alliances generally do
not have long durations or minimum requirements. In addition, they are generally
terminable by iXL or the other party at will.

     iXL has also entered into an agreement with HPS America, Inc. This
agreement is intended to enable HPS to complement and supplement iXL's existing
core engineering capabilities with its expertise in e-commerce, web technology,
rapid application development re-engineering and migration, legacy system
maintenance and enterprise integration. HPS is a joint venture between HCL
Technologies Limited, India's largest information technology company, and Perot
Systems, the world's third largest IT outsourcing company. HPS will provide iXL
with preferred pricing, priority scheduling and customized capabilities via
SEI-CMM Level 5 iXL-dedicated facilities in Noida and Bangalore, India. HPS was
assessed enterprise-wide at Level 5 of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
developed by the Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University,
Pittsburgh, USA.

     The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a federally funded research and
development center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and operated by
Carnegie Mellon University. Only 20 of over 1,000 worldwide assessments have
been assessed at this level. The CMM for Software describes the principles and
practices underlying software process maturity and is intended to help software
organizations improve the maturity of their software processes in terms of an
evolutionary path from ad hoc, chaotic processes to mature, and disciplined
software processes. The CMM is organized into five maturity levels with Level 5
being the highest: (1) Initial; (2) Repeatable; (3) Defined; (4) Managed; and
(5) Optimizing. Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's
software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these
five levels. The key process areas at Level 5 cover the issues that both the
organization and the projects must address in order to implement continual,
measurable software process improvement.

TRADEMARKS

     iXL(TM), the iXL logo, Interactive Excellence(TM), Internet Excellence(TM),
iD5(TM) and the names of products and services offered by iXL are trademarks,
registered trademarks, service marks or registered service marks of iXL.

COMPETITION

     The market for iXL's solutions and services is highly competitive and
characterized by a growing number of companies that have introduced or developed
similar offerings. iXL's target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to
continuous technological changes. In addition, there are relatively low barriers
of entry into iXL's business. iXL currently has limited patented or other
proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering
the Internet consulting market. As a result, iXL's competitors may be better
positioned to address these developments and may react more favorably to these
changes, which could have a material adverse effect on iXL's business, results
of operations and financial condition. Existing and future competitors may
develop or offer solutions and services that provide significant technological,
creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services offered by
iXL.

     iXL classifies its competitors into several groups:

     - e-business solution providers;

     - strategic consulting firms;

     - large information technology consulting services providers; and

     - computer hardware and service vendors.

     iXL's primary competitors today are Sapient Corporation, Proxicom, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Dimension Data), Viant Corp. and smaller professional services
firms. In addition, the "Big Five" consulting firms as well as other large and
small services firms are now offering Internet consulting services. iXL also
competes with professional services groups of computer equipment companies such
as IBM, Computer Sciences Corporation and Electronic Data Systems. These larger
firms may be better positioned than iXL to secure attractive client engagements,
and may also be better positioned to withstand any fluctuations in demand. Many
of iXL's current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and
relationships with clients; larger installed customer bases; and significantly
greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than iXL.
Competitors that have established relationships with large companies but limited
expertise in providing e-business solutions may successfully use their client
relationships to enter iXL's target market or prevent iXL's penetration into
their client accounts. iXL believe that due to the relatively low cost of
entering iXL's markets, competition will intensify and increase in the future.
Many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     This intense competition may limit iXL's ability to become profitable or
result in the loss of market share. As a result, iXL's competitors may be better
positioned to address developments in the industry or may react more effectively
to industry changes, which could adversely affect iXL's business. Additionally,
because

competition for Global 1000 client accounts is significant, some clients are
demanding discounts and/or other preferred terms in their contracts. iXL's
unwillingness or inability to grant discounts in an effort to protect profit
margins may impact iXL's ability to attract or maintain these clients.

EMPLOYEES

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL had approximately 1,000 employees, including
approximately 795 professional services employees, 205 general and
administrative employees, and 75 sales and marketing employees. None of iXL's
employees is represented by a labor union. iXL has experienced no work stoppages
and believes its relationship with its employees is good.

PROPERTIES

     iXL's executive offices are located in Atlanta. Additionally, iXL leases
office space for its principal offices in the following metropolitan areas: New
York, NY; Chicago, IL; Boston, MA; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, VA; and London,
England. iXL has obligations under leases for several of iXL's recently closed
offices. iXL has sublet certain of this space and is currently working to sublet
or enter into lease termination agreements for the remaining space. Even if iXL
is able to sublet these offices, iXL will continue to be responsible for the
tenant obligations in the event of a default by iXL's subtenant.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On or about September 8, 2000, the first in a series of shareholder class
action complaints was filed against iXL and certain of its present and former
directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. Those cases were consolidated by Order dated January 23,
2001, and a consolidated amended class action complaint (Case No.
1:00-CV-2347-CC) was filed on March 27, 2001, naming only iXL as a defendant, on
behalf of a putative class of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired
securities of iXL between November 30, 1999 and September 1, 2000. The amended
complaint seeks damages based on general allegations of false and misleading
press releases and SEC filings concerning our business prospects and financial
statements. The amended complaint asserts claims under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Another complaint related to the
volatility in the market price of iXL's common stock was filed in Redwing Ltd.
v. iXL Enterprises, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:00-CV-29790HTW, United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against iXL and certain of
its present and former directors and officers. The Redwing complaint alleges
causes of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Sections 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, the Georgia Blue
Sky laws, as well as common law claims for breach of contract and negligent
misrepresentation. A second related complaint was filed in Next Century
Communications Corp. v. U. Bertram Ellis, Case No. 1:01-CF-0755-TWT, United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The Next Century
complaint alleges fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary
duty. We have filed motions to dismiss the Redwing complaint. We have moved to
dismiss the class action amended complaint and the Next Century complaint. We
believe we have meritorious defenses to the allegations and intend to defend
these cases vigorously. In light of the nature of the litigation process, there
can be no assurance that iXL will not be constrained to consider reasonable
settlement opportunities or suffer an adverse result, either of which could have
a material adverse impact on iXL.

                  IXL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements relating to iXL's future financial performance, business strategy,
financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks.
iXL's actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by
these forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors,
including, but not limited to, iXL's current liquidity position and need for
additional financing, actions that iXL's lenders could take under the amended
credit facility, the success of iXL's restructuring efforts and other factors
contained in the risk factor disclosure set forth in "Risk Factors," above. The
forward-looking statements contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus
are made only as of the date hereof, and iXL undertakes no obligation to update
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
developments or otherwise.

These solutions can incorporate multiple capabilities, including business
strategy consulting; creative design; information architecture; software
engineering; project management; and audio, video and animation production. iXL
offers its services on a time and materials and fixed-price basis.

     iXL has incurred substantial losses since its inception. As of June 30,
2001, iXL had an accumulated deficit of approximately $570.2 million. There has
been a significant decline in revenue over the last year of the operations. The
demand for Internet consulting services is changing rapidly. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2000, Internet consultants, including iXL, experienced a
significant reduction in demand. This overall slowdown affected iXL in that many
of the Company's Global 1000 clients rethought or delayed implementing their
Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as to our Global 1000 clients
resulted in part from diminished competitive pressures from dot.com companies,
which were struggling or failing. In addition, many larger traditional companies
have chosen to utilize in-house resources for the implementation of their
Internet initiative in lieu of those offered by iXL and its competitors. As a
result, the average amount of time invested by iXL to attempt to secure any
given project has increased. It is likely that demand for Internet consulting
services, including those offered by iXL, will remain lower than prior levels
for the foreseeable future.

     This reduction in demand has adversely affected iXL's revenue. In response
to these factors, iXL initiated an extensive restructuring plan designed to
reduce iXL's workforce and lower general and administrative expenses. This is
further discussed in Note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements
contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. As a result of the
restructuring and employee terminations, iXL may have difficulty retaining its
most qualified employees. Likewise, iXL may have difficulty attracting new
qualified employees. The failure to attract and retain qualified creative,
technical, consulting and sales personnel could materially and adversely affect
iXL's financial condition and results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Comparison of Three Months Ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000

     Revenue.  Revenue decreased $85.7 million, or 73%, to $32.7 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2001 from $118.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the significant reduction
of demand experienced by Internet consultants, including iXL. This overall
slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients reevaluated or
delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as
to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished competitive
pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing. In addition,
many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses decreased
$29.5 million, or 54%, to $25.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2001
from $55.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services headcount over the
same period last year as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts. As a
percentage of revenue, professional services expenses increased from 47% for the
three months ended June 30, 2000 to 78% for the three months ended June 30,
2001. The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue was due to
the substantial decrease in revenue over the same period as described above.
Also, see the discussion of the industry trend in the "Overview" section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.8
million, or 51%, to $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from
$11.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was
primarily attributable to decreased advertising, promotional material, and
public relations expenditures.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
decreased $28.7 million, or 68%, to $13.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 from $42.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000. This
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other Expenses.  Stock-based compensation and
other expense decreased to $405,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2001
from $756,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2000. The $351,000 decrease in
stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in the number of
employees with such stock options as a result of the restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense decreased $222,000, or 5% to $4.7
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $4.9 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL made additional investments in physical
infrastructure and expansion in prior periods in anticipation of continued
growth in 2000. However, this increase in capital assets was offset by the
significant write-offs of property and equipment related to office closures that
iXL has recorded, thus resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense decreased $7.1 million or 63% to $4.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $11.2 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the
write-off of impaired intangible assets that iXL recorded during the three
months ended December 31, 2000 and again during the three months ended June 30,
2001.

     Other Income.  Other income increased $8.0 million to $7.9 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2001 from $(84,000) for the three months ended June
30, 2000. The increase is primarily due to the fact that iXL recorded
approximately $7.0 million in other income related to the adjustment in the
value of certain call rights on warrants associated with iXL's note payable to
ProAct.

     Interest Income.  Interest income decreased $1.3 million or 76% to $350,000
for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $1.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cash and
marketable securities balances at June 30, 2001 versus June 30, 2000.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.1 million or 502% to $1.3
million for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from $219,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to interest expense
and amortization on the note payable to ProAct and an increase in credit
facility fees.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $21.9 million loss as a
result of its equity investment in affiliates during the three months ended June
30, 2000. This loss was related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations. No such charge was recorded for the three months ended June 30,
2001, as all equity investments have a zero basis.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense of benefit in the
three months ended June 30, 2001. This expense was recorded for state income
taxes related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the Tessera
acquisition.

  Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000

     Revenue.  Revenue decreased $146.3 million, or 67%, to $73.4 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $219.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a result of the significant reduction
of demand experienced by Internet consultants, including iXL. This overall
slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients reevaluated or
delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market dynamics as
to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished competitive
pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing. In addition,
many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house resources for
the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those offered by iXL
and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses decreased
$42.2 million, or 41%, to $60.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001
from $103.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services headcount over the
same period last year as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts. As a
percentage of revenue, professional services expenses increased from 47% for the
six months ended June 30, 2000 to 83% for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue was due to the
substantial decrease in revenue over the same period as described above. Also,
see the discussion of the industry trend in the "Overview" section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $10.1
million, or 48%, to $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$21.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was
primarily attributable to decreased advertising, promotional material, and
public relations expenditures.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
decreased $46.0 million, or 58%, to $33.5 million for the six months ended June
30, 2001 from $79.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses as a result of iXL's restructuring efforts.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other Expenses.  Stock-based compensation and
other expense decreased to $606,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$3.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The $3.3 million decrease
in stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in the number of
employees with such stock options as a result of the restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $606,000, or 7% to $9.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $9.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily related to additional
investments in physical infrastructure and expansion in prior periods in
anticipation of continued growth, which was partially offset by the significant
write-offs of property and equipment related to office closures that iXL has
recorded.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense decreased $13.6 million or 62% to $8.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $22.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily a

result of the write-off of impaired intangible assets that iXL recorded during
the three months ended December 31, 2000 and again during the three months ended
June 30, 2000.

     Other Income.  Other income increased $8.0 million to $7.8 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 from $(266,000) for the six months ended June 30,
2000. The increase is primarily due to the fact that iXL recorded approximately
$7.0 million in other income related to the adjustment in the value of certain
call rights on warrants associated with iXL's note payable to ProAct.

     Interest Income.  Interest income decreased $2.4 million or 73% to $937,000
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $3.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cash and
marketable securities balances at June 30, 2001 versus June 30, 2000.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.6 million or 232% to $2.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $(690,000) for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to interest expense
and amortization on the note payable to ProAct and an increase in credit
facility fees.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $32.1 million loss as a
result of its equity investment in affiliates during the six months ended June
30, 2000. This loss was related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations. No such charge was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
as all equity investments have a zero basis.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense of benefit in the
six months ended June 30, 2001. This expense was recorded for state income taxes
related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the Tessera
acquisition.

  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999

     In June 2000, iXL's ownership of ProAct was reduced to approximately 49% of
the voting interest and 85% of ProAct's outstanding common stock. Accordingly,
iXL's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 do
not include the consolidated financial statements of ProAct as a consolidated
subsidiary. iXL instead has accounted for its ownership using the equity method
of accounting. As a result, iXL believes it is difficult to compare the
operating results for the year ended December 31, 2000 to the operating results
for the year ended December 31, 1999.

     Revenue.  Revenue increased $141.0 million, or 64.6%, to $359.3 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $218.3 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was attributable to an increase in
the number and size of client engagements. Revenue for the six months ended
December 31, 2000 was $139.6 million as compared to $219.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. Beginning in the third quarter of 2000, Internet
consultants, including iXL, experienced a significant reduction in demand. This
overall slowdown affected iXL in that many of iXL's Global 1000 clients
rethought or delayed implementing their Internet strategy. This shift in market
dynamics as to iXL's Global 1000 clients resulted in part from diminished
competitive pressures from dot.com companies, which were struggling or failing.
In addition, many larger traditional companies have chosen to utilize in-house
resources for the implementation of their Internet initiatives in lieu of those
offered by iXL and its competitors.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses increased
$103.5 million, or 93.8%, to $213.8 million for the twelve months ended December
31, 2000 from $110.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional services
headcount over the same period last year. As a percentage of professional
services revenue, professional services expenses increased from 50.5% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999 to 59.5% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000. The increase as a percentage of professional services revenue
was due to an increased number of professional services personnel hired in
anticipation of higher demand for Internet consulting services. The demand for
iXL's services did not reach the level iXL anticipated. See the discussion of
the industry trend in the Overview section above.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $9.7
million, or 19.8%, to $39.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
2000 from $49.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. As
discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, the sales and marketing expenses for
ProAct were included in the consolidated sales and marketing expenses contained
in the financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 but
were excluded from the consolidated sales and marketing expenses contained in
the financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000. An
increase in salaries and other payroll related costs, travel expenses and use of
outside services in 2000 over 1999 was offset by the inclusion of ProAct's sales
and marketing expenses in 1999. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing
expenses decreased to 10.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from
22.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
increased $80.2 million, or 83.9%, to $175.8 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 from $95.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt
expense, an increase in rent and increases in salaries, travel and other
administrative expenses related to the increase in the number of general and
administrative personnel necessary to support iXL's anticipated growth. As
discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, the general and administrative
expenses for ProAct were included in the consolidated general and administrative
expenses contained in the financial statements for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 but were excluded from the consolidated general and
administrative expenses contained in the financial statements for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses increased to 48.9% for the twelve months ended December
31, 2000 from 43.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other.  Stock-based compensation and other
expense decreased $0.7 million to $4.2 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 from $4.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due to a decrease in
the number of employees with such stock options as a result of the
restructuring.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $7.6 million to $20.5 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $12.9 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily related to increases
in leasehold improvements and equipment.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense increased $25.8 million to $44.0
million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $18.2 million for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily a result of
the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce recorded in connection with
the acquisition of Tessera Enterprises Systems, Inc.

     Impairment Charge on Intangible Assets.  iXL recorded a $97.4 million
impairment charge on intangible assets during the twelve months ended December
31, 2000. No such charge was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. The charge is the result of a write-down of certain intangible assets
resulting from a sustained drop in the market capitalization of iXL and the
changes in the dynamics of the demand for Internet consulting services. See Note
5 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus.

     Restructuring Charges.  iXL recorded a $76.6 million restructuring charge
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2000. No such charge was recorded
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. The restructuring charge includes
charges for rent and sublease expenses and severance costs. See Note 4 of the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Other Expenses.  Other expenses increased $1.6 million to $1.8 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $0.2 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily the result of the
write off of property and equipment not affiliated with the restructuring
charge.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased $1.8 million to $5.4 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.6 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to increased
cash and marketable securities balances in 2000 versus 1999.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.1 million to $2.1 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 from $1.0 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to borrowings
under iXL's credit facility.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  iXL incurred a $41.1 million loss on
equity investments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 as compared
to a $65,000 loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This loss
was primarily related to iXL's percentage share in ProAct's results of
operations under the equity method of accounting. See Note 3 of the consolidated
financial statements contained elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

     Income Taxes.  iXL recorded income tax expense of $600,000 for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2000. iXL recorded no income tax expense or benefit in
the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. This expense was recorded for state
income taxes related to iXL's operations in Massachusetts, as a result of the
Tessera acquisition.

  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998

     The following discussion relates to iXL's actual operating results for the
periods noted. These operating results include the operations of the companies
acquired by iXL during the periods referenced from the date of acquisition only.
iXL completed 24 acquisitions during 1998 and one during 1999. As a result, iXL
believes the operating results for the year ended December 31, 1999 are not
comparable to the operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998.

     Revenue.  Revenue increased $153.5 million, or 236.9%, to $218.3 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $64.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to a
series of acquisitions throughout 1998 and to an aggressive hiring initiative
throughout 1999 and 1998 which expanded iXL's client base and headcount. The
growth was also due to an increase in the number and size of client engagements
and the development and growth of industry practice groups and other Internet
based business solutions.

     Professional Services Expenses.  Professional services expenses increased
$74.5 million, or 208.1%, to $110.3 million for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999 from $35.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. This
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to the
integration of the companies acquired by iXL, organic growth in billable
headcount, as well as to the development of ProAct. As a percentage of revenue,
professional services expenses decreased to 50.5% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999, down from 55.2% for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in billing rates and
improvements in revenue per billable employee.

     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $33.0
million, or 206.3%, to $49.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999 from $16.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The
increase was primarily attributable to the increase in headcount due to the
development of iXL's sales and marketing infrastructure and staff. As a
percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 22.4% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1999, down from 24.7% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 1998.

     General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses
increased $53.0 million, or 124.4%, to $95.6 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 from $42.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in headcount due
to the integration of the companies acquired by iXL since January 1, 1998, as
well as the expansion of management and physical infrastructure to support the
growth in iXL's operations. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 43.8% for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999, from 65.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998.

     Stock-Based Compensation and Other.  Stock-based compensation and other
expense increased $3.3 million to $4.9 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 from $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1998. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to an increase in
the number of employees with such stock options.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased $7.7 million, or 146%, to
$12.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $5.2 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The increase primarily related to
the depreciation of assets of the companies acquired by iXL since January 1,
1998 and an increase in property and equipment at these companies after
acquisition.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense increased $7.6 million, or 72%, to
$18.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $10.6 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The increase was a result of the
amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce recorded in connection with the
acquisitions that took place during 1998.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased $2.8 million to $3.6 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $0.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily due to increased
cash and marketable securities balances in 1999 versus 1998.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $0.2 million to $1.0 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $0.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily due to borrowings
under iXL's credit facility.

     Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates.  Loss on equity investments decreased
to $65,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 from $1.6 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The decrease was a result of a
reduction in equity investments on which to record losses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     iXL has funded its operations primarily with cash generated from
operations, sales of securities and bank borrowings. On January 7, 2000, iXL
entered into a senior secured revolving syndicated credit facility with several
institutions providing for borrowings of up to $50.0 million. The credit
facility expires on January 7, 2002. The credit facility bears interest payable
at least quarterly at a rate of either (i) 2.75% plus an adjusted LIBOR rate or
(ii) 1.75% plus the greater of Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate or .5% plus the
federal funds rate. The credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all
of the assets of iXL's domestic operating subsidiaries. These obligations are
also secured by all of the capital stock of iXL's domestic operating
subsidiaries, iXL's stock holdings in ProAct, the general and limited
partnership interests in iXL Ventures LP, and 65% of the capital stock of iXL's
foreign subsidiaries, including the pledge of the capital stock of the same
subsidiary companies. The credit facility provides for borrowings based upon a
borrowing base formula of qualified billed and unbilled accounts receivable. A
commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the credit facility.

     On December 7, 2000, iXL executed an amendment to the credit facility to
waive a violation of a financial covenant. The credit facility was further
amended to do the following: restrict the borrowing base to qualified billed
accounts receivable from domestic operations; permit the sale by iXL of equity
interests forming part of the collateral securing iXL's obligations associated
with the credit facility; reduce the amount of permitted capital expenditures;
reduce the minimum required consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and require iXL to maintain an
minimum level of liquidity.

     On March 30, 2001, iXL executed an amendment to its senior secured
revolving syndicated credit facility which reduced the commitment under the
credit facility in stages from $50,000,000 to $20,000,000 pursuant to certain
events, expanded the borrowing base to include foreign receivables and certain
assets of iXL Ventures and eliminated and amended certain financial covenants.
The amended credit facility established certain EBITDA (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenants for the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2001. This amendment to the credit facility became
effective on April 2, 2001. At June 30, 2001, iXL was in violation of a
financial covenant under the credit facility. Effective August

10, 2001, the lenders waived any event of default resulting from this covenant
violation until the earlier of the completion of the pending merger or November
30, 2001 and the commitment under the credit facility was reduced to $8,050,000.

     At June 30, 2001, iXL had $3,700,000 in borrowings outstanding under the
credit facility and had utilized approximately $8,048,000 of the credit facility
for letters of credit issued primarily as security for office leases. iXL repaid
the borrowings outstanding in July 2001.

     On March 30, 2001, pursuant to an agreement in principle reached March 26,
2001, iXL sold 15,875,000 shares of restricted common stock to unaffiliated
third parties and to parties related to iXL through its principal stockholder,
including two directors, for total proceeds of approximately $15,875,000 before
expenses. This stock sale was subject to certain conditions, including the
effectiveness of the amendment to the credit facility as discussed above.

     As of June 30, 2001, iXL had $23.2 million of working capital, including
$25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $202,000 of marketable
securities, as compared to $38.5 million of working capital, including $45.3
million in cash and cash equivalents and $239,000 in marketable securities as of
March 31, 2001 and $40.5 million of working capital, including $48.6 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $4.0 million in marketable securities as of
December 31, 2000.

     Cash used in operating activities was $42.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2001, as compared to cash used in operating activities of $10.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Cash used in operating
activities for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was largely due to a decrease
in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and the restructuring reserve.
iXL calculates average days' sales outstanding (DSO) based on billed and
unbilled receivables less deferred revenue. The DSO for the quarter ended June
30, 2001 was 65 as compared to 77 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Cash
used in investing activities was $651,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2001, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $78.4 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2000. Cash used by investing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 was due to purchases of property and equipment. This
was partially offset by the sale of certain assets that were non-strategic to
the scope of our principal business. Cash provided by financing activities was
$21.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 as compared to cash
provided by financing activities of $24.5 million for the six months ended June
30, 2000. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June
30, 2001 primarily resulted from the sale of restricted common stock.

     iXL has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception. iXL's future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many
factors. iXL's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased to
$52.6 million at December 31, 2000 from $155.7 million at December 31, 1999, of
which $15.2 million related to ProAct. iXL's cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities decreased to $25.8 million at June 30, 2001. At the time
of filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, iXL believed that its existing cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with funds available
under the credit facility, and proceeds from recent stock sales in March 2001
would be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for working capital and
capital expenditures for the remainder of 2001.

     Subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K, iXL has experienced additional
declines in revenue resulting in continued operating losses and iXL violated an
amended debt covenant as of June 30, 2001. On July 31, 2001, iXL and Scient
entered into a definitive agreement to merge. Stockholders of approximately 34%
of the outstanding common stock of iXL and stockholders of approximately 34% of
the outstanding common stock of Scient have agreed to vote their shares in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement. However, there can be no assurance that
the merger will be successfully completed as it is subject to stockholder
approval by the stockholders of each of iXL and Scient respectively.

     iXL believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities and cash from operations, together with funds that may be available
under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for
working capital and capital expenditures until the earlier of the consummation
of the pending merger or November 30, 2001. In the event the merger does not
close by November 30, 2001, iXL would be in violation of certain debt covenants
or be required to collateralize outstanding letters of credit

under the credit facility with cash and, among other things, would not have
access to funds under the credit facility. As a result, iXL would require
additional funds or liquidity to fund its operations or further reduce its
workforce, or both. iXL is also continuing its efforts to raise additional funds
through the sale of certain minority equity interests in developing businesses
held by iXL Ventures. There can be no assurance any such assets can be sold on
acceptable terms or for cash. If iXL raises additional funds through the
issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities, such equity securities
may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of common stock.
Furthermore, because of the low trading price of iXL's common stock, the number
of shares of the new equity or equity-related securities that may be required to
be issued may cause stockholders to experience significant additional dilution.
In addition, the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or
perceived risk of iXL. iXL cannot, however, be certain that additional
financing, or funds from asset sales, will be available on acceptable terms if
required. If this additional financing becomes necessary and is not available or
we are unable to raise funds from the sale of assets or the pending merger with
Scient does not close in the time period anticipated, iXL may need to
dramatically change its business plan or face bankruptcy or liquidation. The
matters discussed above raise substantial doubt about iXL's ability to continue
as a going concern if the merger is not completed. The audited financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

         IXL QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     On December 19, 2000 iXL consummated a transaction with ProAct in which iXL
Ventures PHC, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of iXL, issued a 5.75%
secured convertible note to ProAct in exchange for a cash payment of $20.0
million. The note is secured by and exchangeable for, upon satisfaction of
certain conditions, ten million shares of common stock of ProAct held by iXL
Ventures PHC, Inc. iXL Ventures PHC, Inc. has no other properties or assets
other than its interest in the ProAct common stock. The note is non-recourse to
iXL Enterprises, Inc.

     The note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis
commencing March 31, 2001. The entire amount of unpaid principal and accrued and
unpaid interest is due and payable on January 7, 2004. iXL may at any time
prepay all or a portion of the principal amount. iXL may repay the principal
amount of the note by payment in cash or under certain circumstances by transfer
of the pledged collateral. Also, ProAct, at its option, may at any time (1)
exchange the note for the pledged collateral or (2) purchase the pledged
collateral for $20.0 million. iXL is required to make adjustments to the
carrying value of the note for changes in the fair value of ProAct's common
stock because the terms of the note enable ProAct to exchange the note for the
pledged collateral. iXL will record any resulting adjustment as interest income
or interest expense.

     Additionally, in conjunction with the issuance of the secured convertible
note, iXL issued to ProAct call rights to purchase up to ten million shares of
its common stock owned by iXL Ventures, LP, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of iXL, at a purchase price of $3.00 per share. ProAct may exercise the call
rights at any time for all or a portion of the call shares provided that the
minimum amount of call shares purchased at any time is 500,000. The call rights
expire on January 7, 2004.

     iXL is required to make adjustments to the carrying value of the note for
changes in the fair value of ProAct's common stock because the terms of the note
enable ProAct to exchange the note for the pledged collateral. iXL will record
any resulting adjustment as interest income or interest expense. iXL is also
required to carry the call rights at their fair value during their term with any
resulting changes in the fair value being recorded as other income or expense.
iXL uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of
the call rights. During the three months ended June 30, 2001, iXL adjusted the
value of the call rights by approximately $7.0 million and recorded this amount
as other income.

    are mandated by SEC rules and do not represent iXL estimate or projection of
    the future price of iXL common stock. iXL does not believe that this method
    accurately illustrates the potential value of a stock option.

REPORT OF THE IXL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     The following Report on Executive Compensation and the performance graph
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus do not constitute
soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference
into any other iXL filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent iXL specifically incorporates this
Report or the performance graph by reference therein.

     The Compensation Committee of iXL's Board of Directors is responsible for
the following matters with respect to the compensation of iXL's Chief Executive
Officer and other executive officers as well as those of iXL's subsidiaries:

     - reviews, recommends and approves the base salaries of iXL's and its
       subsidiaries' executive officers;

     - reviews, recommends and approves iXL's annual incentive compensation
       programs;

     - administers iXL's equity-based compensation programs, including approval
       of stock option grants;

     - reviews, recommends and approves changes to iXL's benefits programs;

     - reviews and recommends all employment related agreements and amendments
       thereof; and

     - reviews, approves and authorizes the process and design elements of all
       other aspects of compensation.

     The Compensation Committee through its designees continually monitors
market practices and trends, and makes revisions as necessary to ensure that
iXL's programs are adequate to attract and retain the best possible executive
talent. The Compensation Committee is comprised of three non-employee directors,
namely Messrs. Wall, Bynum, and Walker.

What is iXL's philosophy regarding executive officer compensation?

     iXL's executive compensation programs for 2000, which consisted of a
combination of base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity-based
awards, serve the following principal purposes:

     - to attract and retain the best possible executive talent;

     - to provide additional incentive to these executives to achieve the goals
       inherent in iXL's business strategy;

     - to link executive and shareholder interests through equity-based plans;
       and

     - to provide a compensation package that recognizes individual
       contributions as well as overall business results.

     The Committee believes that this performance and results-based compensation
philosophy will attract and retain the type of executive talent necessary to
achieve iXL's business objectives. iXL's compensation plans have been developed
and communicated in a manner designed to encourage a culture where executives
understand expectations, choose to remain with iXL and seek to improve results.

What are the components of executive compensation?

     In determining compensation levels for 2000, the Compensation Committee
primarily relied upon publicly available compensation information and informal
survey information obtained by management with respect to cash compensation and
stock option grants to similarly situated officers of comparable companies.
Additionally, the Compensation Committee based its review of stock option grants
on various factors, including without limitation the executive's
responsibilities, the executive's past, present and expected future
contributions to iXL and the executive's current stock and option holdings.

     Annual Salary.  The Compensation Committee reviews each executive officer's
salary annually. In determining the appropriate salary levels, the Compensation
Committee considers, among other factors, the executive's scope of
responsibility, prior experience, past accomplishments and data on prevailing
compensa-

tion levels in relevant markets for executive talent. There is no set annual
salary grading structure for iXL's senior executive team, as each salary is
based on an analysis of executive and position-specific information. None of
these factors is weighted or subject to a formula.

     The Compensation Committee believes that the base salary levels of the
executive officers are competitive considering the factors above, and its focus
on at-risk compensation that emphasizes incentive pay.

     Annual Incentive Compensation.  Annual incentives for iXL's executive
officers, excluding its Chief Executive Officer, were determined based on iXL's
and the executive's, as the case may be, achievement of specified goals. The key
measurement areas included, among other factors, client satisfaction, market
awareness, financial performance, organizational goals and personal goals. The
weighting of the key measurements varied for each executive, depending on his or
her role with iXL. Also depending on a participant's role in iXL, the
achievement of certain goals was measured on a company-wide or individual office
basis.

     The Compensation Committee reviewed iXL's and each executive officer's
performance, as well as recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer, in
determining the annual incentive payments to executive officers.

     Long-Term Incentive Compensation.  iXL maintains certain equity-based
compensation plans that allow the Compensation Committee to award the
individuals it selects with stock options. These plans are as follows: (a) the
iXL Enterprises, Inc. 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan, and (b) the iXL
Enterprises, Inc. 1999B Employee Stock Option Plan. Awards under iXL's
stock-based compensation plans directly link potential participant rewards to
increases in shareholder value.

     iXL historically has provided all equity-based compensation in the form of
stock options. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or
greater than the market price of iXL's common stock on the date of the grant and
each generally vest over a four year period in four equal installments of 25% on
each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.
This approach is designed to encourage the creation of shareholder value and the
retention of the executives over the long term, as this element of the
compensation package has value only to the extent that stock price appreciation
occurs.

     In determining stock option awards to iXL's executive officers in 2000, the
Compensation Committee also considered each executive's responsibilities, the
executive's past, present and expected future contributions to iXL and the
executive's current stock and option holdings.

     iXL Leaders Fund, L.P.  During 1999, iXL organized the iXL Leaders Fund,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Fund"). The purpose of the Fund is to
enable iXL to recruit and retain officers and other key employees of outstanding
ability and to motivate these employees to exert their best efforts on iXL's
behalf. The Fund enabled certain qualified iXL employees to participate in
investment opportunities identified by iXL Leaders Fund GP I, L.L.C., the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner") in a variety of private
equity investments.

     Certain iXL employees, who were "accredited investors" (as defined under
the federal securities laws) and who were approved for participation by the
General Partner, were eligible to invest in the Fund as limited partners on a
one-time basis in April 2000. Each participating employee was required to make a
capital commitment of at least $25,000, but no more than $250,000, to the Fund.
iXL matched each participating employee's capital contribution on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, which in the aggregate totaled approximately $2.43
million. No further contributions will be made to the Fund.

     Each participating employee shall be fully vested with respect to returns
on his or her capital contributions and related profits (except upon a default
by such employee), but will vest in certain distributions of other profits
related to iXL's matching contributions with respect to such participating
employee at the rate of 25% per year on December 31 of 2000 through 2003.
Participating employees are not entitled to receive distributions other than
distributions necessary to satisfy his or her tax liabilities in respect of such
investments until iXL has recouped its matching contributions and expenses plus
a 12% return.

How is iXL's chief executive officer compensated?

     The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the compensation
of iXL's Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee believes that in
the highly competitive, emerging markets in which iXL operates, equity-based
compensation provides the greatest incentive for outstanding executive
performance and the greatest alignment of management and shareholder long-term
interests. Mr. Ellis served as Chief Executive Officer during 2000. He did not
receive a cash bonus during 2000, but was granted stock options totaling
510,577. See "-- iXL Stock Option Information -- Option Grants in Last Fiscal
Year" and the footnotes thereto for details concerning grants to Mr. Ellis. In
February 2001, Mr. Formant joined iXL as President and Chief Executive Officer.

How is iXL addressing Internal Revenue Code limits on deductibility of
compensation?

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally
disallows a federal income tax deduction to public companies for certain
compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a corporation's chief executive
officer or any of its four other most highly compensated executive officers.
Qualifying performance-based compensation will not be subject to the deduction
limit if certain requirements are met. iXL has structured its equity-based
compensation plans (i.e., obtained shareholder approval of plans) to qualify the
compensation income deemed to be received upon the exercise of stock options
granted under the plans as performance-based compensation. The Compensation
Committee intends to review the potential effects of Section 162(m) periodically
and in the future may decide to structure additional portions of iXL's
compensation programs in a manner designed to permit unlimited deductibility for
federal income tax purposes. iXL is not currently subject to the limitations of
Section 162(m) because none of its executive officers received cash payments
from iXL during 2000 in excess of $1 million. To the extent that iXL is subject
to the Code 162(m) limitation in the future, the effect of this limitation may
be mitigated by net operating losses, although the amount of any deduction
disallowed under Section 162(m) could increase the alternative minimum tax by up
to 2% of such disallowed amount. For information relating to iXL's net operating
losses, see Note 17 to iXL's Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

IXL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS

     No member of iXL's Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or
employee of iXL or serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation

IXL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     iXL entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Formant beginning
February 1, 2001 continuing until December 31, 2003. Mr. Formant's initial base
salary is $500,000, subject to adjustments annually at the Compensation
Committee's discretion. In addition to Mr. Formant's base salary, he is eligible
to receive a bonus, based upon a formula, in an amount not less than $250,000,
paid in quarterly installments throughout the calendar year. Mr. Formant also
received a option to purchase 1 million shares of iXL's common stock and
purchased 1.5 million shares of common stock (see "iXL Transactions with Related
Parties"). In the event Mr. Formant's employment is terminated for reasons other
than cause, he will be entitled to received twelve months of his then current
base salary together with continued benefits. He will also be entitled to
receive any accrued, but unpaid, bonus amount. The severance payable can be
reduced in the event Mr. Formant finds other suitable employment during the
severance period. In addition, if Mr. Formant is terminated for reasons

other than cause, the greater of (i) one-half of any unvested options or (ii)
vested options resulting from a one-year forward vesting, will immediately vest.
In the event of a change of control, Mr. Formant shall be eligible to receive
any rights, benefits and entitlements made generally available to other members
of executive management. The employment agreement will continue in full force
and effect. Concurrent with any change of control, the greater of (i) one-half
of any unvested options or (ii) vested options resulting from a one-year forward
vesting, will immediately vest. If Mr. Formant is terminated without cause
within one year of a change of control or his duties and responsibilities are
materially diminished, he is entitled to a lump sum payment in an amount equal
to not less than two times his then current base salary plus any accrued, but
unpaid, bonus amount; in addition, the remaining unpaid balance of the four-year
stock purchase loan described in "iXL Transactions with Related Parties" shall
be forgiven and all outstanding stock options be accelerated and fully vested.
Mr. Formant agrees to keep iXL's secrets and confidential information and will
not disclose any such information obtained during his employment. For a period
of twelve months following the end of his employment, or three months if he is
terminated without cause or for good reason, Mr. Formant cannot become
associated with competitive companies listed in the agreement, nor will he
solicit any of iXL's employees and customers or representatives of those
customers. In the event that iXL becomes bankrupt or insolvent within one year
after the date of Mr. Formant's employment agreement, any unpaid amounts due
under the four-year stock purchase loan shall be forgiven.

     In connection with the merger, Mr. Formant and iXL have executed an
Agreement of Amendment and Assignment with respect to his employment agreement.
In the Agreement of Amendment and Assignment, among other things:

     - Mr. Formant consents to the assignment of his employment contract to
       Holdco;

     - Mr. Formant's bonus entitlement is amended to provide for any such bonus
       as determined by the Holdco board of directors;

     - Mr. Formant's severance benefit is amended to eliminate entitlement to
       accrued but unpaid bonuses;

     - Mr. Formant agrees that the transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement will not be deemed to constitute a change of control or good
       reason for resignation;

     - the noncompetition and nonsolicitation of customers provisions applicable
       to Mr. Formant are deleted; and

     - Mr. Formant consents to the treatment of his options in the manner
       applicable to all options as specified in the merger agreement.

This Agreement of Amendment and Assignment will become effective upon completion
of the merger.

                             IXL PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following graph compares, for the period from June 3, 1999 (the date
that iXL's common stock was first publicly traded) to December 31, 2000, the
cumulative total stockholder return on the common stock of iXL with:

     - the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S.) Index; and

     - the J.P. Morgan H&Q Internet Index (formerly known as the Chase H&Q
       Internet Index)

     The graph assumes that $100 was invested on June 3, 1999 in iXL's common
stock and on May 31, 1999 in the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S.) Index and the J.P.
Morgan H&Q Internet Index, and further assumes no payment or reinvestment of
dividends. The stock price performance on the following graph is historical and
not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Christopher M. Formant.................   January 9, 2001           1,500,000           $1,500,000
Frank K. Bynum, Jr.....................    March 30, 2001             275,000              275,000

     In contemplation of his employment, Mr. Formant purchased 1.5 million
shares of iXL common stock in a private placement. The purchase price of $1.00
was the closing market price on the date of purchase. The purchase price of the
shares was paid by two loans from iXL: a four-year promissory note in the amount
of $1 million and a bridge note in the amount of $500,000, each bearing interest
at 9% per annum, payable at maturity. The bridge note was due and payable
promptly upon Mr. Formant's receipt of payment of his capital account (or other
funds such as his 401K) from his previous employer. Mr. Formant repaid the
bridge note in March 2001. The four-year promissory note is due and payable on
January 9, 2005. Mr. Formant has agreed to prepay the loan with the net after
tax proceeds of any annual bonus he receives in excess of $500,000, plus the net
after tax proceeds from the sale of any shares acquired from the stock purchased
or from the sale of exercised stock options. The shares purchased are subject to
the terms and conditions of a Pledge and Security Agreement.

     On March 30, 2001, iXL completed a private placement of common stock to
various investors. iXL director Mr. Bynum participated in this private
placement.

SHAREHOLDER BOARD DESIGNEES

     Under a shareholders agreement, iXL is required to include as board
nominees at every annual stockholders' meeting (or at any special stockholders'
meeting for the election directors) two individuals designated by the Kelso
Funds and one individual designated by J.P. Morgan Partners (23A SBIC), LLC
(formerly CB Investors, L.P.) so long as each of these stockholders own at least
5% of iXL outstanding common stock.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     On March 22, 2000, iXL's former subsidiary ProAct Technologies Corp.
(formerly known as Consumer Financial Network, Inc.) ("ProAct") issued and sold
an aggregate of 32,896,000 shares of its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock
for a purchase price of $4.00 per share. Purchasers of these shares included the
Kelso Funds (of which iXL director Mr. Bynum is a Managing Director) (an
aggregate of 1,250,000 shares), U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. (62,500 shares) and Urchie
B. Ellis, the father of U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. (5,000 shares). In connection with
this equity financing a Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement and a
Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement were executed. The
business purpose of this transaction was to raise working capital. This issuance
was valued based on a negotiated estimate of the fair market value of ProAct.
iXL believes this issuance was negotiated at arms' length and was made on terms
no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     Mr. Ellis is a limited partner in the partnership that owns the building in
which iXL began leasing space in May 1997. The lease expires December 31, 2008.
In 2000, iXL paid approximately $1.1 million in rental payments. iXL believes
this lease is at fair market value and was negotiated on an arm's-length basis.
iXL's effective lease rate is $15.50 per square foot, compared to a range of
$12.50 to $16.50 per square foot for comparable space.

     In March 2000, iXL contributed assets to AppGeneSys, Inc. in exchange for
10 million shares of AppGeneSys' Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 10
million shares of AppGeneSys' Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (constituting
in the aggregate approximately 27% of the voting power of AppGeneSys).
Contemporaneously with such asset contribution, AppGeneSys issued and sold an
aggregate of 50 million shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for a
purchase price of $1.00 per share. Purchasers of these shares included Kelso
Funds (of which iXL director Mr. Bynum is a Managing Director) (an aggregate of
7,300,000 shares, constituting approximately 10% of the voting power), NeoCarta
Ventures, L.P. and NeoCarta Scout Fund, LLC (in which the iXL Leaders Fund,
L.P., Mr. Ellis, and certain of the Kelso investment professionals, including
iXL director Mr. Bynum, hold an interest) (an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares,
constituting approximately 4% of the voting power), the iXL Leaders Fund, L.P.
(500 shares, constituting less than 1% of the voting power), and U. Bertram
Ellis, Jr. (225,000 shares, constituting less than 1% of the voting power). Mr.
Ellis serves as a director of AppGeneSys. In connection with this equity
financing a Stockholders Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement were
executed. The business purpose of this transaction was to raise working capital
for AppGeneSys. This issuance was valued based on a negotiated estimate of the
fair market value of AppGeneSys. The asset contribution was approved by the
Spin-Off Committee of the Board of Directors. iXL believes this issuance was
negotiated at arms' length and was made on terms no less favorable to iXL than
could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Contemporaneously with
these transactions, iXL executed (a) a Master Services Agreement with AppGeneSys
regarding the delivery of services in the ordinary course of business to
AppGeneSys, and (b) a Strategic Alliance Agreement pursuant to which AppGeneSys
will participate in the iXL Ventures Program and iXL became AppGeneSys'
preferred provider of core services, and likewise AppGeneSys has become iXL's
preferred provider of AppGeneSys' core services.

     iXL believes that all of the transactions set forth above were negotiated
at arm's length and were made on terms no less favorable to us than could have
been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

                                SCIENT BUSINESS

     Scient is a leading provider of a category of professional services called
systems innovation. Scient provides integrated eBusiness strategy and technology
implementation services on a global basis to enterprise clients who want to
fully leverage eBusiness technologies as part of their overall business
strategy. Scient's service offering includes strategy consulting, systems
architecture and design, application and technology infrastructure development,
and eBusiness management. Scient's services are designed to improve a client's
competitive position and increase efficiency through the development of
innovative business strategies enabled by the integration of emerging and
existing technologies.

SERVICES

     Scient uses eBusiness as a catalyst to help its clients unlock the value
hidden in their enterprises. Scient's process leverages Scient's expertise in
strategy, customer experience and technology to help clients create new sources
of revenue and eliminate cost. Scient also works with clients to increase their
organization's abilities to anticipate and capitalize on changes in their
business environment. Scient's service offering includes strategy consulting,
architecture and design services, application and technology infrastructure
development, and eBusiness management. The following descriptions highlight the
primary services that Scient offers.

     Strategy Consulting.  Scient works with clients to tailor a business
strategy designed to provide them with measurable results. Scient's goal is to
leverage the industry and eBusiness experience and knowledge base of Scient's
professionals along with the experiences of Scient's clients' senior executives
to formulate innovative, executable and flexible eBusiness strategies.

     Architecture and Design.  In addition to strategy, Scient offers
architecture and design capabilities to its clients. Using a variety of
technologies, Scient architects eBusiness applications and technology
infrastructure for clients. Recognizing that the technical infrastructure
becomes the foundation for any future application development, Scient's
technology infrastructure design services focus on enabling eBusiness
applications to be reliable, robust, secure, scalable and extensible.
Additionally, Scient offers customer experience design to its clients. Because
Scient considers the user interface to be more than just visual design, Scient
incorporates its abilities in information architecture, user interface
engineering, editorial services, and usability research to develop systems with
innovative customer experience.

     Application and Technology Infrastructure Development.  Scient builds and
implements innovative eBusiness applications and technology infrastructure that
take into account the current and future business needs of Scient's clients.
This can be accomplished through Scient's Engineer Acceleration Center (EAC),
with teams located either on the client's site or in Scient's dedicated
facilities in Dallas, Texas. Scient's EAC was established to provide deeply
skilled teams, an integrated customer experience and technology process, along
with dedicated technology to provide the most efficient, effective and highest
quality solutions to Scient's clients. The EAC offers a pre-configured
development environment to Scient's clients that is intended to establish
processes, project management structures, and standards that reduce overall
project risks. All of this results in a reduced cost of development and a
potential accelerated return on investment for Scient's clients. Scient
recognizes that new types of communications devices are proliferating, network
usage is expanding, and the future of eBusiness will be dependent upon the
development and integration of a variety of technologies. Scient builds
applications and technology infrastructure intended to accommodate these changes
in the eBusiness environment. Scient's applications and technology
infrastructure development services utilize Scient's capabilities in application
software, networks, systems, security and infrastructure architecture. Scient
develops applications and technology infrastructure to be robust and to serve as
the foundation for eBusiness innovations that can link to existing systems and
technologies.

     eBusiness Management.  Upon completion of engagements, Scient offers its
clients eBusiness management to help them operate and extend their eBusinesses.
These services include remote systems management, application management,
performance management, content management, and system security management and
are provided on a monthly subscription basis with established service level
agreements. Scient's extended capabilities leverage the iterative nature of the
Scient Approach methodology to provide the framework and business structure for
continuous re-innovation of an eBusiness.

THE SCIENT APPROACH(TM) METHODOLOGY

     The Scient Approach methodology is a well-defined process that helps Scient
efficiently and successfully deliver Scient's services. This methodology
provides a framework that facilitates the distribution of knowledge within an
engagement and across all parts of Scient's firm. The Scient Approach
methodology is designed to allow Scient to provide consistent quality across
engagements and to deliver high value to clients in all aspects of Scient's
services.

     The key to the Scient Approach methodology is the iterative improvement of
the eBusiness innovations that Scient delivers. Because the needs of Scient's
clients are dynamic, Scient has designed the Scient Approach methodology with
built-in feedback and iteration processes in order to improve the services
delivered to clients and to enhance the approach itself. These processes serve
as a critical feedback tool that assists Scient in designing and extending
eBusinesses for its clients.

     The Scient Approach methodology has four general stages: Conceive,
Architect, Engineer and Operate. Each of these stages includes the critical
decisions Scient's clients must make in order to build an eBusiness. The
methodology also includes two foundational elements: Launch and Innovate, which
are interwoven throughout the approach.

     Conceive.  During the Conceive stage of the approach, Scient works closely
with the client to define the overall business strategy for the eBusiness,
including market positioning and value offering. The five components of the
Conceive stage include Assessing, Visioning, Conceptualizing, Prototyping, and
Defining. Upon completion of the Conceive stage, Scient should have the
information necessary to define key business success factors and to prioritize
the client's eBusiness initiatives based on a common understanding of the
client's eBusiness objectives.

     Architect.  In the Architect stage, Scient defines the scope of the
eBusiness to be developed and designs applications to enable clients to meet
their objectives. Scient also scopes and designs the underlying infrastructure
to integrate the software, network and hardware components necessary to support
the applications. This stage includes the evaluation of any third party
software. The architect stage occurs in two phases, Architect-Scope and
Architect-Design.

     - Architect-Scope.  The goal of this phase is to collect application and
       process requirements to develop a baseline for the Architect-Design
       phase.

     - Architect-Design.  During this phase, Scient defines the processes,
       components and timeline necessary to realize the application goals. The
       goal of this phase is to create a complete plan that allows the
       applications to be constructed, tested and implemented on time and within
       budget.

     After the Architect stage, the client has a "blueprint" for its eBusiness
development. This blueprint identifies in detail the tasks necessary to meet the
objectives and overall strategy goals as defined in the Conceive stage.

     Engineer.  In this stage, Scient iteratively builds and delivers the
eBusiness, which may include the incorporation or integration of third party
software or devices. Within this stage are three phases that are focused on
successfully implementing the applications defined during the Architect stage.
Scient has established the Engineer Acceleration Center (EAC) in Dallas, Texas
to provide world class software engineering. The EAC provides deeply skilled
teams, integrated customer experience and technology processes, and dedicated
technology to achieve the most efficient, effective, and highest quality
solutions for Scient's clients.

     - Transition to the EAC.  In this phase, the Scient project team and EAC
       transition team work to transition the project into the EAC by
       understanding the major project components, identify gaps and risks,
       develop solutions and risk mitigation plans, and establish project
       responsibilities to ensure the successful delivery of the project.

     - Engineer-Detailed Design.  In this phase, Scient works with the client to
       finalize specific details of the requirements, including all customer
       interaction interfaces and detailed technical designs.

     - Engineer-Construct.  In this phase, the modules of the application are
       built, refined and unit tested. This phase is aimed at producing the
       tangible results for the client that were identified in the earlier
       stages of the Scient Approach methodology. Development and QA
       environments are constructed, software development is completed, code
       reviews are performed, and unit testing takes place.

     - Engineer-Test.  In this phase, applications are tested to ensure they
       meet functional, technical and user requirements. This phase intends to
       ensure that the engineered applications perform in accordance with the
       requirements defined in the Architect stage. The EAC offers a full suite
       of functional, integration, and system testing to ensure the overall
       quality and robustness of the delivered system.

     - Engineer-Deploy.  In this phase, the system is deployed into a production
       environment, providing the necessary support and rapid issue resolution.

     The Engineer-Deploy phase will deliver the eBusiness system in its
production environment typically employing performance, security, user
acceptance, and limited volume beta test, followed by a full-scale introduction
to the complete target user population.

     Upon completion of the Engineer stage, Scient delivers the system to the
client. During the transition to operate phase, the Scient team completes all
final deliverables, produces the final distribution media, and conducts formal
transition meetings with the appropriate client operations team.

     Operate.  In the Operate stage, Scient transfers knowledge and techniques
for the eBusiness technical operations and provides a framework for ongoing
re-innovation of the client's eBusiness. By leveraging Scient's knowledge about
the ongoing management and innovation of its eBusiness systems, the client can
effectively perform these services in-house or via an outside service provider.
The Operate stage centers around two separate but related sets of activities.

     - eSolution Management.  This area focuses on transferring knowledge and
       techniques for the day-to-day operations of the eBusiness, allowing
       Scient's client to manage and measure the technical operations of the
       eSolution in-house or through a third-party provider. The eSolution
       Management has two steps:

      - Implement.  In this step, the client's operational requirements and
        architecture are assessed. Scient assists the client to implement a high
        availability management solution within the client's infrastructure or
        through a third-party provider.

      - Manage.  In this step, Scient will assist with the client's ongoing
        eBusiness systems management including application management,
        performance management, content management and system security
        management.

     - eBusiness Management.  This area focuses on the strategic planning of an
       eBusiness solution and extending it into new versions with improved
       capabilities. This involves continued re-innovation and improvement in
       the eBusiness solution, implemented via a series of new releases with
       enhanced capabilities.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Through Scient's global direct sales force and marketing organization,
Scient markets and sells Scient's services to clients who are creating
eBusinesses or are rethinking or expanding their existing businesses to
integrate eBusiness capabilities. Scient's sales professionals are aligned
within global business units. Scient currently targets three principal markets:

     - Financial Services Markets, including financial products and services
       providers such as investment and commercial banks, securities firms,
       insurance companies, credit card companies, and online brokerages and
       lending institutions;

     - Enterprise Markets, which includes Global 1000 companies facing the
       challenges of adapting their businesses' traditional procurement and
       distribution networks to take advantage of eBusiness capabili-

       ties including industrial products, consumer packaged goods,
       manufacturing, energy, transportation and logistics, media and
       entertainment, telecommunications and utilities; and

     - Health and Wellness Markets, which includes pharmaceuticals,
       biotechnology, genomes, medical products and technology and consumer
       wellness, and diagnostics.

     Scient employs a team selling approach, whereby Scient's sales people
collaborate with Scient's business unit professionals and management to identify
prospects, conduct sales and manage client relationships. Due to the strategic
nature of Scient's engagements, Scient typically negotiates with the senior
business and technical management personnel of Scient's current and potential
clients.

     Scient's marketing efforts are focused on creating awareness of the systems
innovation category, establishing Scient as the leader in this category and
building the Scient brand on a global basis. Scient uses a broad mix of programs
to accomplish these goals, including market research, brochures, information
pieces published for industry forums, public relations activities, marketing
programs, seminars and speaking engagements and website marketing.

CLIENTS

     Scient has performed professional services for a variety of clients in many
industries around the world. Scient is currently focused on serving companies in
the Financial Services, Enterprise, and Health and Wellness markets. From
inception through March 31, 2001, Scient has served over 165 clients and has
helped its clients launch approximately 50 eBusinesses. For the three months
ended June 30, 2001, Scient's five largest clients accounted for approximately
49% of Scient's revenues.

     Scient generally enters into contracts with its clients on a time and
materials basis, though Scient sometimes works on a fixed-fee basis or caps the
amounts Scient may invoice. In the future, Scient anticipates an increasing
percentage of its client engagements will be under arrangements with fixed-fee
components. If Scient miscalculates the resources or time needed to complete
engagements with capped or fixed fees, Scient's operating results could be
seriously harmed. Because of the strategic and competitively sensitive nature of
the engagements Scient performs for some of its clients, Scient sometimes agrees
not to perform services for Scient's clients' competitors or in a particular
field for limited periods of time. These non-compete agreements reduce the
number of Scient's prospective clients and reinforce the importance of Scient's
client selection.

DELIVERY SERVICES

     Scient's professional services colleagues are organized into areas of
expertise and core competencies called Delivery Services Groups. These Delivery
Services Groups are designed to address the full range of expertise and
competencies needed in order to address the eBusiness needs of clients in
Scient's targeted markets. When Scient delivers services to its clients, Scient
typically builds an integrated team of professionals from several or all of
Scient's Delivery Services Groups. In addition, the Delivery Services Groups
promote the development of specialized knowledge, techniques and experience, and
foster the training, mentoring and professional development of its members. Each
of Scient's professional service colleagues is in one of the following Delivery
Services Groups:

     - Strategic Services -- Provides consulting services to define and
       implement the strategic business, organization, market and brand
       direction for an eBusiness. Includes strategy consultants and industry
       experienced managers, each of whom is focused on one of Scient's targeted
       markets. Includes service offerings in CRM, Knowledge Management and
       Content Management, eIntegration, Collaborative Commerce and the Scient
       Studio.

     - Architecture and Design services -- Integrates the disciplines of
       technical, experience and business architecture, and all elements of
       design.

     - Build Services -- Delivers the skills and expertise necessary to manage
       and engineer the applications and infrastructure of eBusinesses.

     - Asset Services -- Defines and manages the eBusiness assets Scient
       delivers to clients on a subscription, annuity or service bureau basis.
       The Asset Services works with other Delivery Services Groups, global
       business units, operations, finance and management to package and
       subsequently manage those aspects of Scient's assets that can be offered
       on subscription, annuity or service bureau basis.

     - Project Management Services -- Provides the necessary production, project
       and program management skills and experience necessary to manage client
       engagements.

NEIGHBORHOODS

     Scient has established neighborhoods, or organized communities of interest,
that pursue and develop ideas, focus on quality and efficiency improvements, and
establish points of view to improve colleague and client satisfaction. Scient's
neighborhoods span across its global business units, innovation centers and core
services units to minimize redundancies and maximize colleague team-building,
participation and innovation. As of June 30, 2001, Scient had over 20
neighborhoods, spanning areas of interest such as emerging technologies,
eOrganizational issues and customer relationship management.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

     Scient's knowledge management processes and systems, which Scient refers to
as Knowledge Management, enable the development and re-use of Scient's
intellectual capital. Scient has found that while there are unique features to
each client engagement, there is often a degree of commonality. Scient's focus
on particular industries, business processes and technologies creates
intellectual capital that can be adapted for use in different industries and
applications provided that it is not proprietary to a client. Through the Scient
Approach methodology and its iterative process, Scient expects to capture this
common intellectual capital and develop common frameworks, processes, and
technology to use in the delivery of Scient's services. Knowledge Management is
designed to enable each engagement team to bring the experiences of Scient's
entire company to bear on each client engagement.

     Knowledge Management facilitates access to the Scient Approach methodology
and helps Scient's colleagues determine what services to deliver to clients and
when to perform the services during the different steps of the approach.
Resources available through Knowledge Management include tutorial materials,
templates, expert contacts and sample outputs for the different process steps.

     Scient has invested significantly in Knowledge Management with the intent
that such expenditures will allow Scient to use its intellectual capital in
order to accelerate the delivery of its services, reduce its costs and leverage
its industry experience. However, Scient cannot guarantee that Knowledge
Management will help it achieve these goals or will be adequate to support
Scient's future operations.

COMPETITION

     Competition in the eBusiness services market is intense. Scient competes
against companies selling electronic commerce software and services, including
those offering such products and services on a hosted basis, and the in-house
development efforts of companies seeking to engage in electronic commerce.
Scient's current competitors include the following:

     - Systems integrators that primarily engage in fixed-time/fixed-fee
       contracts, such as Sapient, Cambridge Technology Partners, and Viant;

     - Large systems integrators, such as Accenture and the consulting arms of
       the "Big Five" accounting firms;

     - The professional services groups of computer equipment companies, such as
       IBM;

     - Outsourcing firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation and Electronic
       Data Systems;

     - Web consulting firms and online agencies, such as Agency.com, and
       Proxicom (a subsidiary of Dimension Data);

     - General management consulting firms, such as Bain & Company, Booz Allen &
       Hamilton, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company; and

     - Internal IT departments of current and potential clients.

     Because relatively low barriers to entry characterize Scient's market,
Scient also expects other companies to enter Scient's market.

     Scient believes that the principal competitive factors in Scient's industry
are:

     - Value of services provided compared to the price of services;

     - The quality of services and deliverables, technical and strategic
       expertise, project management capabilities, reputation and experience of
       professionals delivering the service; and

     - The effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition, and
       the size of the firm.

     Scient believes that it presently competes favorably with respect to most
of these factors. In particular, Scient believes that it offers an integrated
set of strategic consulting and customer experience skills and technological
expertise that many existing service providers are not well suited to provide.
However, the market for eBusiness services is highly competitive and Scient
cannot be certain that Scient will compete successfully in the future. Scient
expects that competition will continue to intensify in the future, particularly
as large IT consulting firms focus more resources on eBusiness opportunities.
Because Scient contracts with its clients on an engagement-by-engagement basis,
Scient competes for engagements at each stage of its methodology. There is no
guarantee that Scient will be retained by its existing or future clients on
later stages of work. See "Risk Factors -- We operate in a highly competitive
market with relatively low barriers to entry."

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Scient has developed detailed tools, processes and methodologies underlying
the Scient Approach methodology and software code, scripts, libraries, data
models, applications, business processes, frameworks, and other technology used
internally and in client engagements. Scient currently seeks to protect its
proprietary rights and other intellectual property through a combination of
copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, as well as through
contractual protections such as proprietary information agreements and
nondisclosure agreements. Scient cannot guarantee that the steps it has taken to
protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of
Scient's intellectual property, and Scient may not be able to detect
unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce Scient's intellectual
property rights. See "Risk Factors -- Holdco's ability to protect its
intellectual property is important to its business."

COLLEAGUES AND CORPORATE CULTURE

     Colleagues.  Scient generally uses the term "colleagues" instead of
"employees" to reinforce its one-firm concept and collegial culture. As of June
30, 2001, Scient had a total of 510 colleagues. Of these, 399 were in
professional services and 111 were in core services, including Knowledge
Management, Technology, People, Finance and Administration. Scient has offices
in San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Dallas, TX, Chicago, IL, Boston, MA, London,
England and affiliate offices in Paris, France and Tokyo, Japan. Subsequently,
Scient has undertaken restructuring efforts to reduce its workforce and offices;
these activities are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Scient
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" below. Scient's future success will depend in part on its ability to
attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management
personnel, for whom competition is intense. None of Scient's colleagues is
represented by any collective bargaining unit, and Scient has never experienced
a work stoppage. Scient believes its relations with its colleagues are good.

     Corporate Culture.  Scient believes that developing a rich environment and
a one-firm concept with a shared culture is critical to Scient becoming an
employer of choice for management, strategic, technical, design, sales,
marketing and support professionals of all levels. Scient actively fosters a set
of core values that were developed jointly by management and Scient's
colleagues. These values include a dedication to

maintaining an innovative and empowering environment where Scient works as a
team to achieve total client satisfaction and provide its colleagues with
personal and professional growth opportunities. In addition, Scient believes
that by linking employee compensation to the success of Scient through its
incentive compensation program, Scient encourages an owner attitude, which
Scient believes results in decisions that benefit its clients, colleagues and
the company. Scient believes that its ability to attract and retain high-caliber
colleagues will be in large part dependent on Scient's adherence to a one-firm
culture supported by the following values:

     - Spirit -- Growth

     - Community -- Innovation

     - Excellence -- Urgency

Scient announced the move of its headquarters to 39,000 square feet of leased
office space in New York, New York. This transition was substantially completed

in New York, NY, as well as offices in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, Boston,
MA, Dallas, TX, Sunnyvale, CA, Paris, France, Tokyo, Japan and London, England.

OVERVIEW

     Scient's net revenue is derived primarily from providing professional
services to clients who are expanding or reevaluating their existing businesses
to integrate eBusiness capabilities. Although until the quarter ended September
30, 2000, Scient experienced growth in its net revenues, in each quarter since
then Scient has experienced a sequential decline in net revenues quarter to
quarter. Scient believes that the decline in net revenues was primarily due to a
broad-based general economic slowdown in which clients have decreased technology
budgets, increased competitive pressure from traditional management consulting,
information technology services and eBusiness service competitors, and a lack of
urgency by Global 2000 companies to immediately fund large eBusiness projects.

     Scient expects that its net revenues will be driven primarily by the number
and scope of its client engagements, its professional services headcount, and
its ability to appropriately staff those engag
