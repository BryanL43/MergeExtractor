To the stockholders of Talarian Corporation:

   You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of stockholders of
Talarian Corporation to be held at                  on        ,            ,
2002 at   :00 a.m., Pacific Time.

   At the annual meeting, you will be asked to vote upon (a) the proposed
acquisition of Talarian by TIBCO Software Inc., which will be effected by the
merger of Talarian and Panther Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
TIBCO, with the surviving corporation of the merger becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of TIBCO, (b) the election of two Class II directors to the Talarian
board of directors, each to serve until the earlier of the expiration of a
three year term (or until his successor has been elected and qualified or until
his earlier resignation or removal) or the consummation of the merger, and (c)
the ratification of KPMG LLP as Talarian's independent auditors.

   If the merger is completed, each share of Talarian common stock you own will
be converted into the right to receive $2.65 in cash, without interest, and a
fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock equal to the exchange ratio. The
exchange ratio will be determined by dividing $2.65 by the closing trading
price, which is the average of the closing sales prices for one share of TIBCO
common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive
trading days ending and including one day prior to the closing date of the
merger, provided that if the closing trading price is greater than $16.21 or
less than $12.16, then for purposes of calculating the exchange ratio the
closing trading price will be deemed to be $16.21 if the average of the closing
sales prices is greater than $16.21 or $12.16 if the average of the closing
sales prices is less than $12.16.

   TIBCO common stock is traded on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading
symbol "TIBX." On               , 2002, the closing price of TIBCO common stock
was $   per share.

   After careful consideration, your board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger and the merger agreement with TIBCO and has determined that
the merger and the merger agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of, Talarian and its stockholders. The board of directors unanimously
recommends that the Talarian stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger. The Talarian board of directors also
unanimously recommends that the Talarian stockholders vote FOR the election of
each of the nominated Class II directors and FOR the ratification of KPMG LLP
as Talarian's independent auditors.

   The attached notice and accompanying proxy statement/prospectus provide
detailed information about the annual meeting of the Talarian stockholders and
the proposed merger, including additional information about TIBCO and Talarian.

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: What is the merger?

A: TIBCO and Talarian have entered into a merger agreement that sets forth the
   terms and conditions of TIBCO's proposed acquisition of Talarian. In the
   merger, Talarian and Panther Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
   TIBCO, will merge, and the surviving corporation will become a wholly owned
   subsidiary of TIBCO. Following the merger, former Talarian stockholders will
   become stockholders of TIBCO, and will hold approximately   % of the
   outstanding capital stock of TIBCO, based on the capitalization of Talarian
   and TIBCO as of         , 2002.

   For a more complete description of the merger, see the section entitled
   "Proposal No. 1--The Merger" on page 39.

Q: What will Talarian stockholders receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, each share of Talarian common stock will be
   converted into the right to receive $2.65 in cash, without interest, and a
   fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock equal to the exchange ratio.

   The exchange ratio will be determined by dividing $2.65 by the closing
   trading price, which is the average of the closing sales prices for one
   share of TIBCO common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for
   the ten consecutive trading days ending and including one day prior to the
   closing date of the merger, provided that if the closing trading price is
   greater than $16.21 or less than $12.16, then for purposes of calculating
   the exchange ratio, the closing trading price will be deemed to be $16.21 if
   the average of the closing sales prices is greater than $16.21 or $12.16 if
   the average of the closing sales prices is less than $12.16.

   For example, if the closing trading price of TIBCO common stock is $15.00,
   then each share of Talarian common stock will be converted into $2.65 in
   cash and 0.17667 of a share of TIBCO common stock. If you own 100 shares of
   Talarian common stock, then you will receive $265.00 in cash and 17 shares
   of TIBCO common stock. In addition, because TIBCO will not issue any
   fraction of a share, you will receive cash equal to $10.00 instead of the
   0.667 of a share of TIBCO common stock that you would otherwise be entitled
   to receive.

Q: Does the board of directors of Talarian recommend voting in favor of the
   merger?

A: Yes. After careful consideration, the Talarian board of directors
   unanimously recommends that the Talarian stockholders vote FOR the approval
   and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

   For a description of the reasons underlying the recommendation of the
   Talarian board of directors, see the section entitled "Proposal No. 1--The
   Merger--Reasons for the Merger--Talarian's Reasons for the Merger" on page
   42.

Q: Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger?

A: Yes. For example, Talarian and TIBCO may not realize the anticipated
   benefits of the merger. Also, the value that the Talarian stockholders will
   receive in the merger may decrease if the market price of TIBCO common stock
   decreases before or after the merger.

   For a more complete description of the risks to consider, see the section
   entitled "Risk Factors" on page 21.

Q: Other than the merger, am I being asked to vote on anything else?

A: Yes. The Talarian board of directors is also asking you to consider and to
   vote upon (a) the proposed election of Paul D. Callahan and Brian T. Horey
   as Class II directors, each to serve until the earlier of the expiration of
   a three year term (or until his successor has been elected and qualified or
   until his earlier resignation or removal) or the consummation of the merger
   and (b) the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Talarian's
   independent auditors for the year ending September 30, 2002.

   The Talarian board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of
   each of the nominated directors and FOR the ratification of the selection of
   KPMG LLP as Talarian's independent auditors.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including its
   annexes, and to consider how the merger affects you. Then, please mail your
   completed, dated and signed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope
   as soon as possible so that your shares can be voted at the annual meeting
   of the Talarian stockholders. Please also see the instructions included with
   your proxy card.

Q: What happens if I do not return a proxy card or vote?

A: If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
   merger. However, because only votes cast determine the outcome of the other
   proposals before the Talarian annual meeting, your failure to respond will
   have no effect on the proposals to elect two Class II directors and to
   ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as Talarian's independent auditors.

   If you date, sign and mail your proxy card, but do not indicate how you want
   to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of each of the
   proposals, including the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
   and the merger, and in the case of the proposal for electing two Class II
   directors, as a vote in favor of the election of each of the nominated
   directors.

   If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same effect
   as a vote against the merger and the proposal to ratify the selection of
   KPMG LLP as Talarian's independent auditors. However, because only votes
   cast determine the outcome of the proposal to elect two Class II directors,
   if you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have no effect on
   that proposal.

Q: May I vote in person?

A: Yes. You may attend the annual meeting of the Talarian stockholders and vote
   your shares in person whether or not you sign and return your proxy card.

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy card is voted at
   the annual meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can
   send a written, dated notice to the secretary of Talarian stating that you
   would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete, date, and submit
   a new proxy card. Third, you can attend the annual meeting and vote in
   person. Your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have
   instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions received
   from your broker to change those instructions.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my
   shares for me?

A: Your broker will not be able to vote your shares unless you provide your
   broker with instructions on how to vote your shares. You should instruct
   your broker to vote your shares, following the procedure provided by your
   broker. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted and you will, in
   effect, be voting against the merger. Because only votes cast determine the
   outcome of the other proposals to be voted upon by the stockholders at the
   Talarian annual meeting, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote on
   these other proposals, your proxy will have no effect on the proposals to
   elect two Class II directors and to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as
   Talarian's independent auditors.

Q: What vote is required to approve the merger?

A: The approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger will
   require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
   Talarian common stock outstanding on the record date.

Q: What are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the
   merger to me?

A: The material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to
   you depend upon the structure of the merger used by TIBCO and Talarian,
   which will not be known until the completion date of the merger.

   Accordingly, at the time you vote on the merger at the Talarian annual
   meeting, you will not know whether or not, for United States federal income
   tax purposes, the issuance to you of TIBCO common stock in the merger will
   be a taxable event to you. TIBCO and Talarian intend, if possible pursuant
   to the terms of the merger, for the merger to qualify as a reorganization
   within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
   as amended. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, the Talarian
   stockholders generally will not recognize any gain or loss for federal
   income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of Talarian common stock for
   shares of TIBCO common stock, although the Talarian stockholders will
   recognize taxable income with respect to the cash received as part of the
   merger consideration, in lieu of fractional shares of TIBCO common stock, or
   upon exercise of appraisal rights. If the merger does not qualify as a
   reorganization, the merger will be a fully taxable transaction to the
   Talarian stockholders. The actual tax consequences of the merger to you will
   be based upon the merger structure used by TIBCO and Talarian for completing
   the merger, and because this structure will depend in part on the market
   price of TIBCO common stock prior to the closing of the merger, the actual
   tax consequences will not be known by you until the completion of the merger.

   We urge you to consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the
   tax consequences of the merger to you.

   For a more detailed description of the tax consequences of the merger, see
   the section entitled "Proposal No. 1--The Merger--Material United States
   Federal Income Tax Considerations" on page 54.

Q: Should I send in my Talarian stock certificates now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions
   from TIBCO explaining how to exchange your shares of Talarian common stock
   for the merger consideration.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. In
   addition to obtaining stockholder approval, we must satisfy all other
   closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including regulatory
   approval. We anticipate that the closing of the merger will occur in TIBCO's
   second fiscal quarter of 2002, but we cannot predict the exact timing.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights?

A: Yes. Under Delaware law, holders of Talarian common stock are entitled to
   appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

   For a more complete description of your appraisal rights, see the section
   entitled "Proposal No. 1--The Merger--Appraisal Rights" on page 57.

The Merger and the Merger Agreement (pages 39 and 61)

   TIBCO and Talarian have entered into a merger agreement that provides for
the merger of Panther Acquisition Corp., a newly formed and wholly owned
subsidiary of TIBCO, with Talarian. As a result of the merger, the surviving
corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO, and Talarian
stockholders will receive cash and shares of TIBCO common stock.

   Structure of the Merger.  The merger agreement provides that the merger will
be structured as a "forward triangular merger" (in which Talarian will merge
with and into Panther Acquisition Corp., with Panther Acquisition Corp.
continuing as the surviving corporation). However, TIBCO may elect to change
the structure of the merger to a "reverse triangular merger" (in which Panther
Acquisition Corp. will merge with and into Talarian, with Talarian continuing
as the surviving corporation). TIBCO may elect to effect this change if TIBCO
cannot obtain a tax opinion that the forward triangular merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or TIBCO reasonably determines in good faith that the
fair market value of the TIBCO common stock to be issued in the merger will not
equal at least 45% of the total fair market value of the aggregate merger
consideration, in each case determined as of the time the merger is completed.
If TIBCO undertakes the reverse triangular merger and if the TIBCO common stock
issued in the merger as of the time the merger is completed is at least equal
to 40% of the total fair market value of aggregate merger consideration at that
time, Talarian will elect to require TIBCO to complete a "second-step forward
triangular merger". In that case, Talarian as the surviving corporation of the
initial reverse triangular merger will be merged with and into another direct,
wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO, with such subsidiary of TIBCO continuing as
the ultimate surviving corporation. Each of these three potential structures is
referred to as the "merger" in this proxy statement/prospectus. Due to the
contingencies inherent in the selection of the merger structure and
particularly, the market value of TIBCO common stock prior to the closing of
the merger, the ultimate structure of the merger will not be known until the
merger is completed.

   Merger Consideration.  If the merger is completed, each share of Talarian
common stock will be converted into the right to receive $2.65 in cash, without
interest, and a fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock equal to the exchange
ratio. The exchange ratio will be determined by dividing $2.65 by the closing
trading price, which is the average of the closing sales prices for one share
of TIBCO common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten
consecutive trading days ending and including one day prior to the closing date
of the merger, provided that if the closing trading price is greater than
$16.21 or less than $12.16, then for purposes of calculating the exchange ratio
the closing trading price will be deemed to be $16.21 if the average closing
sales price is greater than $16.21 or $12.16 if the average closing sales price
is less than $12.16.

   Conversion of Talarian Options and Warrant.  If the merger is completed,
each outstanding option and warrant to purchase Talarian common stock will be
assumed by TIBCO and converted into an option or warrant, as applicable, to
receive $2.65 in cash per Talarian share for which such option or warrant is
exercisable and to purchase shares of TIBCO common stock. The number of shares
of TIBCO common stock subject to, and the

exercise price of, the assumed options and warrants will be adjusted based on
the exchange ratio. The terms of the assumed options and warrants will
otherwise remain unchanged.

   The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
A. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully.

Annual Meeting of Talarian Stockholders (page 35)

   Talarian will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders on     ,          ,
2002 at   :00 a.m., Pacific Time, at                        . At the meeting,
the Talarian stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger. In addition, the Talarian
stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to elect Paul D. Callahan and
Brian T. Horey, the nominees of the Talarian board, as Class II directors, each
to serve until the earlier of the expiration of a three year term (or until his
successor has been elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or
removal) or the consummation of the merger, and to ratify the selection of KPMG
LLP as Talarian's independent auditors for the year ending September 30, 2002.

   Only holders of record of Talarian common stock at the close of business
on        , 2002, the record date for the annual meeting, are entitled to
notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. A majority of the shares of
Talarian common stock outstanding on the record date must be present, in person
or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. The merger must be
approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of Talarian common stock
outstanding on the record date. The two Class II directors must be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares of Talarian common stock cast at the
annual meeting. Ratification of the selection of KPMG as Talarian's independent
auditors must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
of Talarian common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal.

   The directors and executive officers of Talarian and their affiliates own
approximately   % of the shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting. At the
time the merger agreement was signed, directors and executive officers of
Talarian and their affiliates who own approximately   % of the total shares of
Talarian common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting entered into a
voting agreement, in the form attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex B, pursuant to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of Talarian
common stock for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger
and against any proposal, action or transaction that could prevent, materially
impede or delay the merger.

Recommendation of Talarian's Board of Directors (pages 35 and 45)

   The Talarian board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the
merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Talarian and its
stockholders. The Talarian board of directors unanimously recommends that its
stockholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger. The Talarian board of directors also unanimously recommends that the
Talarian stockholders vote FOR the election of each of the nominated Class II
directors and FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Talarian's
independent auditors.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Talarian (page 45 and Annex C)

   Talarian's financial advisor, Lehman Brothers Inc., has delivered a written
opinion, dated January 3, 2002, to the Talarian board of directors as to the
fairness as of that date, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Talarian common stock of the merger consideration to be received by the holders
of Talarian common stock in the merger. The full text of the written opinion of
Lehman Brothers, dated January 3, 2002, is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex C. We encourage you to read this opinion
carefully in its entirety for a description of

the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations of
the review undertaken by Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers' opinion is directed
to the Talarian board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to
any Talarian stockholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations (page 54)

   The United States federal income tax consequences of the merger vary
depending on the ultimate structure of the merger. The merger will be
structured as (a) a forward triangular merger pursuant to which Talarian will
merge with and into Panther Acquisition Corp., with Panther Acquisition Corp.
continuing as the surviving corporation, or (b) a reverse triangular merger
pursuant to which Panther Acquisition Corp. will merge with and into Talarian,
with Talarian continuing as the surviving corporation, or (c) a reverse
triangular merger followed by a second-step forward triangular merger pursuant
to which the surviving corporation of the reverse triangular merger will merge
with and into another wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO, with such subsidiary of
TIBCO continuing as the surviving corporation. All three of these merger
structures may be referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
"merger." Talarian stockholders will not know which merger structure is used by
the parties until the date when the merger is completed.

   In general, provided the merger is structured as a forward triangular
merger, the merger is expected to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. In that case, if you
exchange your shares of Talarian common stock for TIBCO common stock and cash
in the merger, you will recognize gain but not loss, for United States federal
income tax purposes, in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of cash
you receive in the merger and (b) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1)
the sum of the amount of cash you receive in the merger and the fair market
value of the TIBCO common stock you receive in the merger as of the time the
merger is completed over (2) the tax adjusted basis of your shares of Talarian
common stock.

   However, TIBCO may elect to change the structure of the merger to a reverse
triangular merger if either it cannot obtain a tax opinion that the forward
triangular merger will qualify as a reorganization, after using reasonable
efforts to do so, or it reasonably determines in good faith that the fair
market value of the TIBCO common stock to be issued in the merger as of the
time the merger is completed will not at least equal 45% of the total fair
market value of the aggregate merger consideration at that time. If TIBCO
undertakes the reverse triangular merger and if the TIBCO common stock to be
issued in the merger as of the closing of the merger is at least equal to 40%
of the total fair market value of the aggregate merger consideration, Talarian
will elect to cause TIBCO to further undertake a second-step forward triangular
merger. If used, the combined merger structure, the reverse triangular merger
followed by a second-step forward triangular merger, more likely than not will
qualify as a reorganization with identical United States federal income tax
consequences described above with respect to the forward triangular merger.
However, such qualification is not free from doubt, because the combined merger
structure has not specifically been determined to so qualify as a
reorganization by any court decision or ruling of the Internal Revenue Service,
although the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that an analogous transaction
structure qualifies as a reorganization.

   If the structure of the merger is changed to a reverse triangular merger and
Talarian does not elect to cause TIBCO to undertake the second-step forward
triangular merger, the merger will not be a reorganization. In this case,
instead of the tax consequences described above, you will recognize gain or
loss, for United States federal income tax purposes, in an amount equal to the
difference between (a) the sum of the cash and the fair market value, as of the
completion of the merger, of the TIBCO common stock you receive and (b) the
adjusted tax basis of your shares of Talarian common stock.

   We encourage you to consult your tax advisor about the effect that the
merger will have on you and the impact of any special circumstances that may
affect your particular situation.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (page 49)

   In considering the recommendation of the Talarian board of directors that
you vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, you should
be aware that some of the officers and directors of Talarian have interests in
the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. These
interests relate to, among other things:

    .  Talarian stock options held by each of Talarian's non-employee directors
       will become fully accelerated and exercisable, in accordance with their
       terms, for cash and shares of TIBCO common stock upon the closing of the
       merger;

    .  Talarian stock options held by Talarian's executive officers will be
       assumed in the merger and will vest as to 50% of such officers' unvested
       shares upon the closing of the merger. In addition, each of Talarian's
       executive officers will be entitled to further acceleration of all
       unvested shares held by them if any such officer's employment with
       Talarian or TIBCO is terminated, other than for cause, within 60 days
       prior to or 12 months after the consummation of the merger, or such
       officer terminates his employment because of an adverse and material
       change in his compensation or duties;

    .  Thomas J. Laffey, a director and executive officer of Talarian, has
       entered into an employment agreement with TIBCO that is effective upon
       the consummation of the merger and other officers of Talarian may be
       employed with TIBCO following the consummation of the merger; and

    .  directors and officers of Talarian have customary rights to
       indemnification against specified liabilities, each has an
       indemnification agreement with Talarian and TIBCO is required to
       maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for them for a
       specified period of time.

Conditions to Closing the Merger (page 68)

   TIBCO and Talarian will complete the merger only if the conditions specified
in the merger agreement are either satisfied or waived, which include the
following:

    .  the merger agreement and the merger must be approved and adopted by the
       Talarian stockholders;

    .  TIBCO's registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus
       is a part, must be effective, no stop order suspending its effectiveness
       may be in effect and no proceedings for suspending its effectiveness may
       be pending or threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission;

    .  no governmental entity will have enacted a law, regulation or order that
       has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
       merger;

    .  no governmental entity will have commenced or threatened in writing any
       proceeding preventing the merger or restricting TIBCO's operations after
       the merger;

    .  the applicable waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws must have
       expired or been terminated;

    .  Talarian must have net working capital at the closing of the merger of
       at least $40 million, less transaction expenses incurred by Talarian in
       connection with the merger and less $2 million for each month, pro rated
       for any portion of a full month, that elapses between March 31, 2002 and
       the effective time of the merger;

    .  the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement
       must be true and correct, except any failure that individually or in the
       aggregate does not constitute a material adverse effect on such party;

    .  the parties must have complied in all material respects with their
       respective agreements in the merger agreement; and

    .  Talarian must have obtained all necessary consents and approvals with
       regard to the merger under specified material contracts or obtained
       rights to alternative technology instead of the technology licensed
       under these specified contracts.

Governmental and Regulatory Matters (page 53)

   The merger is subject to antitrust laws. Each of TIBCO and Talarian has made
the required filings with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and
will make any necessary filings with foreign regulatory agencies. Other than
compliance with these antitrust laws, applicable federal and state securities
laws in connection with the issuance of the TIBCO common stock pursuant to the
merger, and applicable provisions of Delaware law, no United States federal or
state regulatory requirements must be complied with in order to complete the
merger.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 70)

   TIBCO, Panther Acquisition Corp. and Talarian may mutually agree in writing
to terminate the merger agreement at any time without completing the merger.
Either TIBCO or Talarian may terminate the merger agreement if:

    .  the merger is not completed, without fault of the terminating party, by
       June 30, 2002;

    .  a governmental authority has issued a final, non-appealable order,
       decree or ruling, or taken any other action, that would permanently
       prohibit the merger;

    .  the Talarian stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement
       and the merger, except that Talarian may not terminate the merger
       agreement if stockholder approval was not obtained because of Talarian's
       action or failure to act, which constitutes a breach of the merger
       agreement; or

    .  the other party breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement in the merger agreement, or any representation or warranty
       becomes untrue, in either case such that the breaching party is unable
       to satisfy a condition to the merger, except that the other party cannot
       terminate the merger agreement if it is at that time in material breach
       or if the breaching party has cured the breach within 20 days of written
       notice of the breach.

   In addition, TIBCO may terminate the merger agreement if any of the
following "triggering events" occurs:

    .  Talarian's board of directors withholds, withdraws, amends or modifies
       in a manner adverse to TIBCO its recommendation in favor of the approval
       and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger;

    .  Talarian fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the
       recommendation of the Talarian board of directors in favor of the
       approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger;

    .  the Talarian board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
       favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
       merger within 10 days after TIBCO requests in writing that the
       recommendation be reaffirmed;

    .  the Talarian board of directors approves or publicly recommends an
       acquisition proposal other than the merger with TIBCO;

    .  the commencement of a tender or exchange offer relating to more than 20%
       of the outstanding Talarian voting securities and the Talarian board of
       directors fails to send a statement to the Talarian stockholders
       recommending the rejection of the tender or exchange offer; or

    .  Talarian intentionally breaches its non-solicitation obligations under
       the merger agreement.

   Termination of the merger agreement will generally terminate the obligations
of the parties to perform their obligations under the merger agreement, except
that the parties must continue to comply with miscellaneous provisions that
survive termination of the merger agreement, including those concerning mutual
confidentiality, and, if applicable, Talarian's payment of a termination fee
and TIBCO's transaction expenses.

Termination Fee and Expenses (page 71)

   If TIBCO terminates the merger agreement due to the occurrence of any
triggering event, Talarian will be required to pay TIBCO a termination fee of
$3,850,000. Talarian will also be required to pay TIBCO the termination fee if
the merger agreement is terminated due to the failure of the Talarian
stockholders to approve the merger or Talarian's uncured breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger
agreement and, within six months following such termination, Talarian enters
into, or publicly announces its intention to enter into, a transaction where
the stockholders of Talarian prior to the transaction own less than 50% of the
surviving entity or majority control of Talarian's voting stock, or
substantially all of Talarian's assets, is acquired by a third party and such
acquisition is subsequently consummated.

   Other than the termination fee, TIBCO and Talarian will generally bear their
own costs and expenses in connection with the merger. However, if TIBCO
terminates the merger agreement after a triggering event or if either TIBCO or
Talarian terminates the merger agreement because the required Talarian
stockholder vote is not obtained, Talarian will be required to pay up to
$550,000 of the fees and expenses incurred by TIBCO in connection with the
merger. In addition, if TIBCO terminates the merger agreement due to Talarian's
uncured breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in the merger agreement, Talarian will be required to pay up to $550,000 of the
fees and expenses incurred by TIBCO in connection with the merger.

No Solicitation (page 66)

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Talarian has agreed, with limited exceptions, not to take any action, directly
or indirectly, with respect to an "acquisition proposal," as described on page
67 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

   If Talarian receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal
that the Talarian board of directors reasonably determines is reasonably likely
to lead to a "superior offer," as described on page 67 of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Talarian may furnish non-public information regarding it
and may enter into discussions with the person who has made the acquisition
proposal if it provides written notice to TIBCO and follows other specified
procedures described on page 66 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

   Talarian has agreed to inform TIBCO promptly as to any acquisition proposal,
or request for non-public information or inquiry that it reasonably believes
could lead to an acquisition proposal. Talarian has agreed to inform TIBCO of
the status and details of any acquisition proposal.

   The Talarian board of directors may change its recommendation in favor of
the merger if it concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Talarian stockholders
under applicable law.

Restrictions on Resales of TIBCO Common Stock (page 60)

   All shares of TIBCO common stock to be received by the Talarian stockholders
in connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is
considered an affiliate of either Talarian or TIBCO under the Securities Act.

Listing of TIBCO Common Stock to be Issued in the Merger (page 60)

   TIBCO common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "TIBX." TIBCO will list the shares of TIBCO common stock to be
issued in the merger for trading on The Nasdaq National Market.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (page 57)

   The merger will be treated as a purchase for accounting and financial
reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles, which means
that Talarian will be treated as a separate entity for periods prior to the
closing of the merger, and thereafter as a wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO.

Appraisal Rights (page 57)

   Under Delaware law, the Talarian stockholders are entitled to appraisal
rights with respect to the merger and, if the merger is completed, to receive
payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of Talarian common stock. In
general, to preserve their appraisal rights, the Talarian stockholders who wish
to exercise these rights must:

    .  deliver a written demand for appraisal to Talarian at or before the time
       the vote is taken at the Talarian annual meeting;

    .  not vote their shares for approval and adoption of the merger agreement
       and the merger;

    .  continuously hold their shares of Talarian common stock from the date
       they make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger; and

    .  comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
       Delaware General Corporation Law.

   The text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law governing
appraisal rights is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.
Your failure to comply with the procedures described in Annex D will result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. We urge you to read the text of Section 262
governing appraisal rights carefully.

             SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA
                   (in thousands, except per share amounts)

   The following selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data is being
provided to give you a better picture of what the results of operations and the
financial position of the combined businesses of TIBCO and Talarian might have
looked like had the merger occurred on December 1, 2000 for statements of
operations purposes and on November 30, 2001 for balance sheet purposes. The
selected unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations data for the year
ended November 30, 2001 combines TIBCO's and Talarian's consolidated statement
of operations data for the year ended November 30, 2001 and September 30, 2001,
respectively. The selected unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet data
assumes that the merger took place on November 30, 2001 and combines TIBCO's
November 30, 2001 consolidated balance sheet data and Talarian's September 30,
2001 consolidated balance sheet data.

   This information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of what the results of operations or financial position
of TIBCO would have been if the acquisition of Talarian actually occurred on
the dates assumed. In addition, this information is not necessarily indicative
of what TIBCO's future consolidated operating results or consolidated financial
position will be.

               COMPARATIVE AND PRO FORMA COMBINED PER SHARE DATA

   The following table presents certain unaudited historical per share and
combined pro forma per share data of TIBCO and Talarian after giving effect to
the merger of TIBCO and Talarian using the purchase method of accounting. The
pro forma data does not purport to be indicative of the results of future
operations or the results that would have occurred had the merger been
consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. The information set
forth below should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of TIBCO incorporated by reference
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of Talarian and the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial data included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus. All share information has been restated, as applicable,
for stock splits, as discussed in each entity's respective consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto. The unaudited pro forma combined and
unaudited pro forma equivalent per share data combine the results of operations
of TIBCO for the year ended November 30, 2001 and Talarian for the year ended
September 30, 2001, and TIBCO's financial position at November 30, 2001 with
Talarian's financial position at September 30, 2001. No cash dividends have
ever been declared or paid on TIBCO common stock or Talarian common stock.

(1) The historical net book value per TIBCO share is computed by dividing
    stockholders' equity by the number of shares of TIBCO common stock
    outstanding at November 30, 2001. The historical net book value per
    Talarian share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity by the number
    of shares of Talarian common stock outstanding at September 30, 2001. The
    pro forma net book value per combined company's share is computed by
    dividing the pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of
    shares of TIBCO common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2001, assuming
    the merger had occurred as of that date.
(2) Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma net loss per basic share were
    computed based on the assumption that 3.3 million shares of TIBCO common
    stock will be issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of Talarian
    common stock, and by adding that share number to TIBCO's weighted average
    shares outstanding. Options and warrants outstanding during 2001 were not
    included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because inclusion
    of such options and warrants would have been antidilutive.
(3) The equivalent pro forma combined net loss and net book value per
    equivalent Talarian share calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined
    amounts by the assumed exchange ratio of 0.1687 shares of TIBCO common
    stock for each share of Talarian common stock.

Recent Share Prices

   The following table provides the closing prices per share of TIBCO common
stock and Talarian common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market on
January 4, 2002, the last full trading day preceding the public announcement
that TIBCO and Talarian had entered into the merger agreement, and         ,
2002, the last full trading day for which closing prices were available at the
time of the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus.

   This table also provides the equivalent price per share of Talarian common
stock on those dates. The equivalent price per share of Talarian common stock
equals $2.65 in cash plus shares of TIBCO common stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing $2.65 by the average of the closing sale prices for a
share of TIBCO common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the
10 consecutive trading days ending and including one day prior to that date,
provided that if the closing trading price is greater than $16.21, then the
closing trading price is deemed to be $16.21, and if the closing trading price
is less than $12.16, then the closing trading price is deemed to be
$12.16.

   We urge you to obtain current market quotations for TIBCO common stock and
Talarian common stock. We cannot predict the market prices for either TIBCO
common stock or Talarian common stock at any time before completion of the
merger or the market price for TIBCO common stock after the completion of the
merger. Because the market price of TIBCO common stock is subject to
fluctuation, the market value of the shares of TIBCO common stock that holders
of Talarian common stock will receive in the merger may increase or decrease.

Dividend Information

   Neither TIBCO nor Talarian has ever paid any cash dividends on their shares
of capital stock, and both anticipate that they will continue to retain any
earnings for the foreseeable future for use in the operation of their
respective businesses. Under the merger agreement, Talarian has agreed not to
pay dividends pending the completion of the merger, without the written consent
of TIBCO.

Number of Stockholders

   As of         , 2002, there were approximately     stockholders of record of
Talarian common stock.

               STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This proxy
statement/prospectus contains such "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements may be made directly in this
proxy statement/prospectus referring to Talarian and TIBCO, and they may also
be made a part of this proxy statement/prospectus by reference to other
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by TIBCO and
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. These
statements may include statements regarding the period following completion of
the merger.

   Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend,"
"plan," "project," "seek," and words and terms of similar substance used in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, or
expected strategic benefits, advantages and other effects of the merger
identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are
management's present expectations of future events and are subject to a number
of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. In addition
to the risks related to the businesses of TIBCO, Talarian and the combined
company, the factors relating to the merger discussed under "Risk Factors" of
this proxy statement/prospectus, among others, could cause actual results to
differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
Neither Talarian nor TIBCO make any representation as to whether any projected
or estimated financial information contained in any forward-looking statements
will be obtained and stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus or the date of the document incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement/prospectus. Neither Talarian nor TIBCO is under any
obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

   For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements,
please see the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the annual reports on Form
10-K that Talarian and TIBCO have filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

                                 RISK FACTORS

   The merger involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the merger,
Talarian stockholders will be choosing to invest in TIBCO common stock. An
investment in TIBCO common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to
the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus, Talarian stockholders should carefully consider the
following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger.

   If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, financial
condition or prospects of either or both of TIBCO and Talarian may be seriously
harmed. In such case, the trading price of TIBCO common stock or Talarian
common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Related to the Merger

Since the average closing trading price of TIBCO common stock used for
determining the merger exchange ratio is subject to contractual price
limitations, the merger exchange ratio may not fully reflect changes in the
market value of Talarian common stock or TIBCO common stock before the closing
of the merger and accordingly, the value to be received by Talarian's
stockholders will decrease if the market value of TIBCO common stock falls
below $12.16.

   The merger exchange ratio will be determined based on the average closing
trading price of TIBCO common stock during the 10 consecutive trading days
ending the day prior to the closing date, provided that if such average closing
trading price is greater than $16.21 or less than $12.16, then the average
closing trading price for calculating the merger exchange ratio will be deemed
to be $16.21 or $12.16, respectively. Accordingly, the value to be received by
Talarian's stockholders will decrease if the market value of TIBCO common stock
falls below $12.16. The parties will not adjust the merger exchange ratio if
the market price of TIBCO common stock fluctuates above or below these limits
or if the market price of Talarian common stock appreciates in value. The value
of TIBCO common stock that Talarian stockholders will receive upon completion
of the merger will depend on the average closing trading price of TIBCO common
stock. The share prices of both Talarian common stock and TIBCO common stock
are subject to price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity
securities and have each experienced significant volatility. Neither TIBCO nor
Talarian can predict the market prices for either Talarian common stock or
TIBCO common stock at any time before the completion of the merger or the
market price for TIBCO common stock after the merger. TIBCO and Talarian
encourage you to obtain current market quotations of TIBCO common stock and
Talarian common stock.

The merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization, resulting in the
recognition of taxable gains or losses on the receipt of TIBCO common stock for
Talarian common stock in the merger.

   At the time you vote on the merger you will not know whether, for United
States federal income tax purposes, the issuance to you of TIBCO common stock
in the merger will be a taxable event to you. TIBCO and Talarian intend, if
possible pursuant to the terms of the merger, for the merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. TIBCO and Talarian, however, cannot provide any assurance that following
the merger the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the tax status of
the merger.

   TIBCO and Talarian will structure the merger as either a forward triangular
merger, a reverse triangular merger or a reverse triangular merger followed by
a second-step forward triangular merger. The forward triangular merger, if
used, is expected to qualify as a reorganization. The reverse triangular merger
followed by a second-step forward triangular merger more likely than not will
qualify as a reorganization, provided that the fair market value of the TIBCO
common stock issued by TIBCO to Talarian stockholders, determined at the
completion of the merger, will not be less than 40% of the total fair market
value of the aggregate merger consideration paid to or for the benefit of the
Talarian stockholders as of the completion of the merger. If the merger
qualifies as a reorganization, then you generally will recognize gain for U.S.
federal income tax purposes

as a result of the merger in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of
cash you receive in the merger and (b) an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value as of the time
the merger is completed of the TIBCO common stock you receive in the merger
over (2) your adjusted tax basis of your Talarian common stock.

   Alternatively, if TIBCO elects to change the structure of the merger to a
reverse triangular merger and TIBCO does not undertake the second-step forward
triangular merger, then the merger will not be a reorganization and the
issuance of TIBCO common stock and cash to you will be a fully taxable event.
In this taxable scenario, you generally will recognize gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between
(a) the sum of the cash and the fair market value, as of the completion of the
merger, of the TIBCO common stock you receive in the merger and (b) the
adjusted tax basis in your shares of Talarian common stock. See "Proposal
No. 1--The Merger--Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences."

TIBCO will face technical, operational and strategic challenges that may
prevent it from successfully integrating Talarian with TIBCO.

   The integration of TIBCO and Talarian will be a time consuming and expensive
process and may disrupt the combined company's operations if it is not
completed in a timely and efficient manner. If this integration effort is not
successful, the combined company's results of operations could be harmed,
employee morale could decline, key employees could leave and customers could
cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones. In addition, TIBCO may
not achieve any of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger.
Following the merger, TIBCO and Talarian must operate as a combined
organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating
procedures, financial controls and human resources practices. TIBCO and
Talarian may encounter the following difficulties, costs and delays involved in
integrating their operations:

    .  potential incompatibility of business cultures;

    .  potential difficulties in successfully integrating the management teams
       and employees of TIBCO and Talarian;

    .  managing the combined company's growth and managing larger, more
       geographically dispersed operations;

    .  perceived adverse changes in business focus;

    .  failure of the combined company to successfully manage relationships
       with customers, suppliers and other important relationships;

    .  failure of the combined company's customers to accept new services or to
       continue using the products and services of the combined company; and

    .  the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management
       from other ongoing business concerns.

The challenges of integrating the businesses of TIBCO and Talarian may be
increased by each company's ongoing efforts to integrate recent acquisitions by
TIBCO and Talarian.

Failure to complete the proposed merger could adversely affect the market price
of Talarian's and/or TIBCO's common stock and future business, operations and
prospects.

   The merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of closing conditions,
including the approval by Talarian's stockholders and regulatory agencies, and
we cannot assure you that the merger will be successfully completed. In the
event that the merger is not completed, Talarian and/or TIBCO may be subject to
a number of material risks, including the following:

    .  Talarian may be required to pay TIBCO a termination fee of $3,850,000;

    .  To the extent that the current market price for its common stock
       reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed, the
       price of Talarian's common stock may decline;

    .  Costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, and
       some advisory fees, must be paid, even if the merger is not completed;
       and

    .  Restoring Talarian's business to its pre-announcement of merger value
       could take a substantial amount of time and resources, and may not occur.

   Further, if the merger is not completed and Talarian's board of directors
determines to seek another business combination, Talarian may not be able to
find an acquiror willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than
that which would have been paid in the merger with TIBCO.

Talarian officers and directors have interests that are different from, or in
addition to, those of the Talarian stockholders generally.

   The officers and directors of Talarian have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, those of Talarian stockholders
generally. These include:

    .  Talarian stock options held by each of Talarian's non-employee directors
       will become fully accelerated and exercisable, in accordance with their
       terms, for cash and shares of TIBCO common stock upon the closing of the
       merger;

    .  Talarian stock options held by Talarian's executive officers will be
       assumed in the merger and will vest as to 50% of such officers' unvested
       shares upon the closing of the merger. In addition, each of Talarian's
       executive officers will be entitled to further acceleration of all
       unvested shares held by them if any such officer's employment with
       Talarian or TIBCO is terminated, other than for cause, within 60 days
       prior to or 12 months after the consummation of the merger, or such
       officer terminates his employment because of an adverse and material
       change in his compensation or duties;

    .  Thomas J. Laffey, a director and executive officer of Talarian, has
       entered into an employment agreement with TIBCO that is effective upon
       the consummation of the merger and other officers of Talarian may be
       employed with TIBCO following the consummation of the merger; and

    .  directors and officers of Talarian have customary rights to
       indemnification against specified liabilities, each has an
       indemnification agreement with Talarian and TIBCO is required to
       maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for them for a
       specified period of time.

   As a result, these officers and directors could be more likely to vote to
approve, and recommend the approval of, the merger agreement and the merger
than if they did not hold these interests.

The market price of TIBCO common stock is highly volatile, and if the merger's
benefits do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the
market price of TIBCO common stock may decline.

   In the past, TIBCO common stock has experienced substantial price
volatility. This volatility might occur in the future, which could cause the
TIBCO common stock to be worth less after the merger than before the merger.
Volatility can arise particularly in response to quarter-to-quarter variations
in the actual or anticipated financial results of TIBCO, its customers or
competitors, and announcements by TIBCO or its competitors regarding new
product and service introductions. The market price of TIBCO common stock can
also fluctuate in response to price and volume fluctuations in the stock
market, particularly those that affect the market prices of technology stocks.

   In addition, the market price of TIBCO common stock may decline as a result
of the merger if:

    .  the integration of TIBCO and Talarian is unsuccessful;

    .  TIBCO does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly
       as, or to the extent, anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or

    .  the effect of the merger on TIBCO's financial results is not consistent
       with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

The business of Talarian could suffer in response to the announcement of the
merger.

   The announcement of the merger may have a negative impact on Talarian's
ability to sell its products and services, attract and retain key management,
development or other personnel, maintain and attract new customers, and
maintain strategic relationships with third parties. For example, Talarian may
experience cancellations or a decline in the rate of orders for its products or
services or a deterioration in its customer relationships. In addition,
Talarian's employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with
TIBCO. If the merger is not completed, Talarian could be harmed by these
adverse changes in its business or the expectation of these changes, and
restoring Talarian's business to its pre-announcement value could take a long
time and be costly, and may not occur.

The completion of the merger may result in dilution in future per share
operating results to the stockholders of TIBCO.

   The completion of the merger will not necessarily result in improved per
share operating results of the combined company or a financial condition
superior to that which would have been achieved by either of the companies on a
stand-alone basis. The merger could fail to produce the benefits that the
companies anticipate, or could have other adverse effects that TIBCO and
Talarian currently do not foresee. In this event, the merger could result in a
reduction of per-share earnings of the combined company as compared to the
per-share earnings that would have been achieved if the merger had not occurred.

A pending class-action lawsuit, if successful, could prevent the business
combination of TIBCO and Talarian.

   On January 8, 2002, a purported class action complaint was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara against
Talarian and the directors of Talarian. The complaint generally alleges that
Talarian and the directors of Talarian have breached their fiduciary duties to
the Talarian stockholders in approving the merger, that the directors engaged
in self-dealing in connection with their approval of the merger and that, in
approving the merger, the directors failed to take steps to maximize the value
of Talarian to its stockholders. The complaint seeks class certification and
certain forms of equitable relief, including enjoining the consummation of the
merger. Talarian believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to
defend against the complaint vigorously. Talarian, however, cannot provide any
assurance that Talarian or the other defendants will be successful. The defense
of this lawsuit could result in the diversion of the time and attention of
Talarian's management away from the business operations of Talarian and the
completion of the merger, and could prevent the consummation of the merger,
which could harm Talarian's business. Negative developments with respect to the
lawsuit could cause Talarian's stock price to decline. If Talarian is required
to pay any amounts in connection with the resolution of the lawsuit by
settlement or otherwise, such a payment may reduce its cash reserves.

Risks Related to TIBCO's Business

   If the merger is successfully completed, holders of Talarian common stock
will become holders of TIBCO common stock. TIBCO's business differs from
Talarian's business, and TIBCO's results of operations, as well as the price of
TIBCO common stock, may be affected by factors different from, or in addition
to, those affecting Talarian's results of operations and the price of Talarian
common stock before the merger.

   The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect TIBCO's
future operating results and prospects and could cause actual events to differ
materially from those predicted in forward-looking statements related to its
business.

TIBCO has a history of losses and expects future losses, and if TIBCO does not
achieve and sustain profitability its business will suffer and its stock price
may decline.

   TIBCO may not be able to sustain its growth or obtain sufficient revenue to
achieve and sustain profitability. TIBCO incurred net losses of approximately
$13.2 million, $25.0 million and $19.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999
respectively. As of November 30, 2001, TIBCO had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $75.3 million.

   TIBCO has invested significantly in building its sales and marketing
organization and in its technology research and development. TIBCO expects to
continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing
enhancements to its existing and new software products and its direct sales and
marketing activities. As a result, TIBCO needs to generate significant revenue
to achieve and maintain profitability.

TIBCO's future revenue is unpredictable, and TIBCO expects its quarterly
operating results to fluctuate, which may cause its stock price to decline.

   Period-to-period comparisons of TIBCO's operating results may not be a good
indication of its future performance. Moreover, TIBCO's operating results in
some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and
investors. In that event, its stock price would likely decline. As a result of
TIBCO's limited operating history, its business strategy and the evolving
nature of the markets in which it competes, TIBCO may have difficulty
accurately forecasting its revenue in any given period. In addition to the
factors discussed elsewhere in this section, a number of factors may cause
TIBCO's revenue to fall short of its expectations or cause fluctuations in its
operating results, including:

    .  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services
       by TIBCO's competitors;

    .  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures
       relating to the expansion of TIBCO's operations; and

    .  the capital and expense budgeting decisions of TIBCO's customers.

   In addition, TIBCO's quarterly operating results are historically subject to
variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors, which generally result
in lower sales activity in its first and third fiscal quarters.

There can be no assurance that any of TIBCO's customers will continue to
purchase its products in the future.

   TIBCO does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers. There can
be no assurance that any of TIBCO's customers will continue to purchase its
products in the future. As a result, a customer that generates substantial
revenue for TIBCO in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent
periods. One customer accounted for 10.0% and 11.2% of TIBCO's total revenue in
the second and third quarters of fiscal 2001, respectively.

TIBCO's licensing and distribution relationship with Reuters places limitations
on its ability to conduct its business.

   TIBCO has a significant relationship with Reuters for licensing and
distribution. TIBCO's relationship with Reuters involves limitations and
restrictions on its business, as well as other risks, described below.

   Reuters has access to the intellectual property used in TIBCO's products,
and could use the intellectual property to compete with TIBCO.  TIBCO licenses
from Reuters the underlying TIB messaging technology, that existed as of
December 31, 1996, which is incorporated into some of its important TIBCO
ActiveEnterprise products. TIBCO does not own this technology. Reuters is not
restricted from using the TIB technology to produce products that compete with
TIBCO's products, and it can grant limited licenses to the TIB technology to
others who may compete with TIBCO. In addition, TIBCO must license all of the
intellectual property and products it creates through December 2011 to Reuters.
This will place Reuters in a position to more easily develop products that
compete with TIBCO's product offerings.

   TIBCO must rely on Reuters and other distributors to sell its products in
the financial services market, and they may not be successful in doing
so.  Under TIBCO's agreements with Reuters, TIBCO is restricted from selling
its products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the
financial services market and major competitors of Reuters, and from using the
TIB technology TIBCO licenses from Reuters to develop products specifically for
use by these companies. Accordingly, TIBCO must rely on Reuters and other
third-party resellers and distributors to sell its products to these companies.

   A significant portion of TIBCO's revenue from sales in the financial
services market consists of product fees paid to TIBCO by Reuters.  Although
Reuters is a distributor of TIBCO's products in the financial services market
and is required to pay TIBCO guaranteed minimum product fee payments until the
end of 2002, Reuters has no contractual obligation to distribute TIBCO's
products to financial services customers. Reuters and other distributors may
not be successful in selling TIBCO's products into the financial services
market, or they may elect to sell competitive third-party products into that
market, either of which may adversely affect TIBCO's revenue in that market. In
addition, when TIBCO sells to customers in the financial services market, TIBCO
must pay a fee to Reuters.

   TIBCO's relationship with Reuters restricts its ability to earn revenue from
sales in the financial services market.  Under the license agreement, Reuters
is required to pay TIBCO product fees based on a percentage of its revenue from
sales of TIBCO products in the financial services market, excluding products
that are embedded in any Reuters products. These product fees may be materially
less than the product fees TIBCO could obtain from other distributors or
resellers in the financial services market. In addition, when TIBCO sells its
products into the financial services market through third-party distributors
other than Reuters, Reuters receives a share of TIBCO's license revenue.

   TIBCO's license agreement with Reuters imposes practical restrictions on
TIBCO's ability to acquire other companies.  The license agreement places no
specific restrictions on TIBCO's ability to acquire companies with all or part
of their business in the financial services market. However, under the terms of
the license agreement, TIBCO is prohibited from bundling or combining its
products that are based on licensed technology with an acquired company's
products and services and then selling the bundled or combined products
directly to financial services companies. This prohibition could prevent TIBCO
from realizing potential synergies with companies it acquires.

The market for e-business infrastructure software may not grow as quickly as
TIBCO anticipates, which would cause its revenue to fall below expectations.

   The market for infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving. TIBCO
earns a substantial portion of its revenue from sales of its infrastructure
software, including application integration software, and related services.
TIBCO expects to earn substantially all of its revenue in the foreseeable
future from sales of these products and services. TIBCO's future financial
performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations
demanding software and services for application integration, information
delivery and seeking outside vendors to develop, manage and maintain this
software for their critical applications. Many of TIBCO's potential customers
have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would
incur

significant costs in switching to third-party products, which may substantially
inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software. If the market
fails to grow, or grows more slowly than TIBCO expects, its sales will be
adversely affected. In addition, a weakening global economy may lead to slower
sales growth.

TIBCO's acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems.

   TIBCO's success depends on its ability to continually enhance and broaden
its product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands,
and competitive pressures. To this end, TIBCO may acquire new and complementary
businesses, products or technologies. TIBCO does not know if it will be able to
complete any acquisitions or be able to successfully integrate any acquired
business, operate them profitably, or retain their key employees. Integrating
any newly acquired business, product or technology could be expensive and
time-consuming, could disrupt TIBCO's ongoing business, and could distract its
management. TIBCO may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and
more established companies with greater financial resources. In addition, in
order to finance any acquisitions, TIBCO might need to raise additional funds
through public or private financings. In that event, TIBCO could be forced to
obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to TIBCO and,
in the case of equity financing, that results in dilution to its stockholders.
If TIBCO is unable to integrate any newly acquired entity, products or
technology effectively, its business, financial condition and operating results
would suffer. In addition, any amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm TIBCO's
operating results.

TIBCO's investment strategy could cause financial or operational problems.

   Through November 30, 2001, TIBCO had invested $27.4 million in companies
with complementary technologies or products which provide it with access to
additional vertical markets and customers, and TIBCO plans to continue making
such investments in the future. The companies in which TIBCO invests are often
at early stages of development, and no public market exists for their
securities at the time of TIBCO's investment. These investments may not result
in any meaningful commercial benefit to TIBCO, and TIBCO's investments could
lose all or a significant part of their value. Moreover, in certain
circumstances, these investments could subject TIBCO to restrictions imposed by
the Investment Company Act of 1940. TIBCO might have to take actions, including
buying, refraining from buying, selling or refraining from selling securities
when it would otherwise not wish to, in order to avoid registration under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

TIBCO's stock price may be volatile, which could cause investors to lose all or
part of their investments in TIBCO stock.

   The stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology companies in
particular, have recently experienced volatility which has often been unrelated
to the operating performance of any particular company or companies. During
fiscal 2001, for example, TIBCO's stock price fluctuated between a high of
$77.50 and a low of $5.07. If market or industry-based fluctuations continue,
TIBCO's stock price could decline in the future regardless of its actual
operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments.

The rapid growth of TIBCO's operations could strain its resources and cause its
business to suffer.

   TIBCO's ability to successfully offer products and services and implement
its business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning
and management process. TIBCO has increased the scope of its operations and has
increased its headcount substantially, both domestically and internationally.
TIBCO must successfully integrate these new employees into its operations and
generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these
employees. If TIBCO fails to successfully integrate employees or to generate
the revenue necessary to offset employee-related expenses, it could be forced
to reduce its headcount, which would force TIBCO to incur significant expenses
and would harm its business and operating results. For example, in response to
changing market conditions, in fiscal 2001, TIBCO recorded a restructuring
charge of $21.2 million, including $2.8 million related to a reduction of its
headcount by approximately 170 employees. TIBCO's growth

has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on its management
systems, infrastructure and resources. TIBCO expects that it will need to
continue to improve its financial and managerial controls, reporting systems
and procedures. TIBCO will also need to continue to train and manage its
workforce worldwide. Furthermore, TIBCO expects that it will be required to
manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other
third parties. Failure to expand any of the foregoing areas efficiently and
effectively could interfere with the growth of TIBCO's business as a whole.

Pending litigation could harm TIBCO's business.

   Between July 6, 2001 and December 6, 2001, several purported class action
complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against TIBCO, several of its current and former officers
and directors and the underwriters of TIBCO's July 1999 initial public offering
and March 2000 follow-on offering. The complaints generally allege that the
named defendants violated federal securities laws because the prospectuses
related the offerings failed to disclose, and contained false and misleading
statements regarding, certain commissions purported to have been received by
the underwriters, and other underwriter practices, in connection with their
allocation of shares in TIBCO's offerings. TIBCO believes that the claims
against it and TIBCO's current and former officers and directors are without
merit and intends to defend against the complaints vigorously. The complaints
do not specify the amount of damages that the plaintiffs seek, and as a result,
TIBCO is unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be
incurred as a result of the lawsuits. TIBCO has not accrued any amounts
relating to potential damages associated with the lawsuits. The uncertainty
associated with a substantial unresolved lawsuit could harm TIBCO's business,
financial condition and reputation. The defense of the lawsuits could result in
the diversion of TIBCO's management's time and attention away from business
operations, which could harm its business. Negative developments with respect
to the lawsuits could cause TIBCO's stock price to decline. In addition,
although TIBCO is unable to determine the amount, if any, that it may be
required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement
or otherwise, such a payment could seriously harm TIBCO's financial condition,
results of operations and liquidity.

Risks Related to Talarian's Business

   If the merger is not completed, Talarian intends to continue as an
independent public company. For more information regarding Talarian, please see
"Business of Talarian," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of Talarian," Talarian's financial
statements and other sections of this document. If Talarian operates as an
independent company and if any of the following risks actually occur,
Talarian's business, financial condition and results of operations could be
seriously harmed.

   If the merger is consummated, Talarian will constitute a part of TIBCO's
business, and the combined company may be subject to some of the following
risks related to Talarian's business, including, but not limited to, the risks
regarding unknown defects in Talarian's products, interruptions in Talarian's
service to its customers and the infringement by Talarian of a third party's
intellectual property. As a result, it is important for you to carefully
consider the following risks related to Talarian's business.

Talarian has a history of losses, expects future losses, and may never achieve
or maintain profitability.

   Talarian has a history of losses, expects future losses, and does not expect
to achieve profitability in the near future. Talarian incurred net losses of
$3.5 million in fiscal 1999, $15.0 million in fiscal 2000 and $23.4 million in
fiscal 2001, and $3.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2001. As
of December 31, 2001, Talarian had an accumulated deficit of approximately $51
million. Talarian cannot assure you that its revenue will grow or that it will
achieve or maintain profitability in the future. While Talarian intends to
maintain controls on expenses at approximately current levels, it may be
necessary to increase its future product development, sales and marketing, and
administrative expenses. In any event, Talarian will need to increase its
revenue substantially to achieve and maintain profitability, which it may not
be able to do.

Economic conditions may reduce demand for Talarian's products and services.

   Talarian's revenue, and its ability to achieve and sustain profitability,
depends on the overall demand for the software products and services it offers.
The general economic slowdown in the world economy has caused many companies to
defer purchases of products and services and otherwise altered their purchasing
patterns. Capital spending in the information technology sector generally has
decreased over the past twelve to eighteen months, and many of Talarian's
customers and potential customers have experienced declines in their revenue
and operations. The terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 have increased the
uncertainty in the economic environment, and Talarian cannot predict the impact
of these events or possible similar or related future events on its customers
or its business. If United States or global economic conditions worsen, it will
likely have a material adverse impact on Talarian's business, operating
results, and financial condition.

Talarian's operating results are difficult to predict in advance and may
fluctuate significantly, and a failure to meet the revenue expectations of
securities analysts or investors might result in a decline in Talarian's stock
price.

   Talarian's future operating results may vary significantly. If Talarian's
operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or
investors, its stock price is likely to decline.

   Talarian's revenue and operating results have depended upon the volume and
timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery.
Historically, Talarian has had little backlog and its revenue in any quarter
has been substantially dependent upon orders booked in that quarter. In
addition, more than 50% of Talarian's license revenue in a given quarter has
often been recorded in the third month of that quarter, with a concentration of
this revenue in the last two weeks of the third month. Furthermore, more than
50% of Talarian's revenue has often been derived from fewer than 10 customers.
For example, in the first quarter ended December 31, 2001, seven customers
represented more than 50% of Talarian's revenue and one customer accounted for
more than 10% of Talarian's revenue. Talarian expects these trends to continue
and, therefore, any failure or delay in the closing of orders could have a
material adverse effect on its quarterly operating results. Additionally, since
Talarian's operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue and because a
high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a shortfall in
anticipated revenue could have a significant negative impact on its operating
results.

   Other factors that may cause Talarian's revenue or operating results to fall
short of expectations include:

    .  the uncertainty of current economic conditions and their effect on
       customer purchase decisions;

    .  the amount and timing of sales and marketing expenses and other
       operating costs and capital expenditures relating to Talarian's business;

    .  changes in prices of, and the adoption of different pricing strategies
       for, Talarian's products and those of its competitors;

    .  changes in the demand for Talarian's products due to the announcement or
       introduction of new or enhanced products or services by Talarian or its
       competitors;

    .  the capital and expense budgeting decisions of Talarian customers; and

    .  the impact of possible acquisitions both on Talarian's operations and on
       its reported operating results due to associated accounting charges.

Variations in the time it takes Talarian to sell its products may cause
fluctuations in its operating results.

   Variations in the length of Talarian's sales cycles could cause its revenue
to fluctuate widely from period to period. The period between Talarian's
initial contact with a customer and the time when it recognizes revenue from
that customer varies widely in length. Talarian's sales cycles typically range
from three to nine months. For larger opportunities with new customers, these
cycles can be longer. Additionally, due to the mission-critical

nature of many deployments of Talarian's products, its customers may take a
long time to evaluate Talarian's products, and many individuals may be involved
in the evaluation process. In addition, many of Talarian's customers purchase
its real-time infrastructure software as part of a large-scale information
technology project, which includes the purchase of many products from a number
of vendors. Changes in the scheduling of these projects, or delays or problems
caused by other vendors or their products, may cause unexpected delays in
Talarian's sales cycles.

Competition in the market for Talarian's products is intense; many of
Talarian's competitors and potential competitors are much larger than Talarian
and have significantly greater resources; Talarian may not be able to compete
effectively.

   The market for Talarian's products is intensely competitive, relatively new,
rapidly evolving, and subject to rapid technological change. Talarian believes
that competition will become more intense in the future and may cause price
reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any one of which
could significantly reduce Talarian's future revenue. Current and potential
competitors include:

    .  enterprise application integration vendors such as Sybase (NEON), Level
       8, IONA, Mercator, TIBCO, webMethods, seeBeyond and Vitria Technology;

    .  infrastructure software and application server providers such as IBM,
       Microsoft, Oracle, Sun and BEA;

    .  vendors of widely used operating system software, including Microsoft
       and Sun Microsystems, which may integrate real-time integration
       functionality into future versions of their operating system software or
       introduce directly competing integration functionality; and

    .  information technology departments of potential customers which have
       developed or may develop systems that provide for some or all of the
       functionality of Talarian's SmartSockets software and related products.

   Many of Talarian's current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and
marketing resources, greater name recognition and larger customer bases.
Talarian's competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior
to those Talarian offers, adapt more quickly than Talarian does to new
technologies, evolving industry trends or customer requirements, or devote
greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
Many of Talarian's competitors also have well-established relationships with
Talarian's existing and prospective customers as well as companies that have
significant influence in the industry. Negotiating and maintaining favorable
customer and strategic relationships is critical to Talarian's business, and
its competitors may be able to negotiate strategic relationships on more
favorable terms than Talarian is able to negotiate.

   Furthermore, a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic
relationships that would enable them to offer, or bring to market earlier,
products or services that are superior to Talarian's products and services in
terms of features, quality, pricing or other factors. Talarian expects
additional competition from other established and emerging companies. The
industry in which Talarian competes is rapidly evolving. Talarian may not be
able to compete effectively against current and potential competitors,
especially those with significantly greater resources.

Some of Talarian's competitors have significantly broader product offerings,
and Talarian may need to partner with third parties to provide a broader range
of products and services.

   Talarian's customers often purchase their real-time infrastructure software
as part of a large-scale information technology project requiring many products
from many vendors. Many of Talarian's competitors offer extended product lines,
and some customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors that are able
to offer broader functionality than can be provided by Talarian's products
alone as part of the customers' overall information technology project. For
example, some of Talarian's competitors offer a larger number of "adaptors"

that facilitate connecting their products with third-party applications, and
some competitors have products that contain a software feature, known as
"business logic," that facilitates the routing and delivery of information in a
different manner than is used by Talarian's products. In order to compete more
effectively, Talarian may need to expand the breadth of its product offerings
by partnering with companies offering complementary products. Talarian may not
be able to enter into relationships of this type, on reasonable terms or at
all, and its failure to do so could adversely affect Talarian's ability to sell
its products and services.

Talarian derives more than 85% of its total revenue from the SmartSockets
product line and if demand for SmartSockets decreases or does not increase,
Talarian's total revenue will not increase and may decrease.

   Talarian currently derives more than 85% of its total revenue from licensing
the SmartSockets software product line and providing related consulting and
maintenance services. Talarian expects to continue to derive a substantial
portion of its revenue from these sources for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, Talarian's future operating results will depend on the demand for
SmartSockets by future customers. If Talarian's competitors release products
that are superior to SmartSockets in performance or price, SmartSockets is not
widely accepted by the market, or Talarian fails to enhance SmartSockets and
introduce new versions in a timely manner, demand for this product may decrease
or fail to increase. A decline in demand for SmartSockets or a failure of
demand to increase, as a result of competition, technological change or other
factors, would significantly and adversely affect Talarian's business,
financial condition, and operating results.

If Talarian does not keep pace with technological change or industry standards,
its products may not be competitive and Talarian's revenue and operating
results may suffer.

   Talarian's industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent
new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving customer demands and
industry standards. Talarian's products may not be competitive if Talarian
fails to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet new customer
demands, support new standards, or integrate with new or upgraded versions of
packaged applications. The development of new products is complex, and there
can be no assurance that Talarian will be able to complete development in a
timely manner, or at all. There are currently no widely accepted standards in
various technical areas of importance to Talarian, including the areas of
reliable multicast and business-quality messaging. There can be no assurance
that the proposed standards Talarian supports will prevail or be widely
adopted. Talarian believes that it will need to continue to enhance its
products and develop new products to keep pace with competitive and
technological developments and evolving industry standards, and Talarian's
failure to do so on a timely basis, or to achieve market acceptance for its
products, would harm its revenue and operating results.

Failure to develop and maintain key strategic relationships could cause
Talarian to lose market opportunities and limit its growth.

   Talarian believes that its success in penetrating its target markets depends
in part upon Talarian's ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships
with key original equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, distributors,
and independent software vendors. Relationships with these parties are also
important because they often influence a customer's decision on which
infrastructure software will be used for a project. Talarian believes these
relationships will introduce its products to potential customers and provide
Talarian with insights into new technologies to which it may not otherwise have
access. For example, a system integrator that is responsible for reengineering
a network may be heavily involved in analyzing and ultimately selecting the
infrastructure software to be used in the network. To date, Talarian has
informal working relationships with several system integrators and formal
agreements with only a limited number of system integrators. Some of Talarian's
competitors have developed more strategic relationships than Talarian has.
Talarian cannot be certain that it will be able to establish relationships with
additional companies on a timely basis, or at all, or that these companies will
devote adequate resources to embedding, promoting or selling its products.
Potential conflicts between Talarian's direct sales force and third-party
reselling efforts could also limit its ability to develop additional key
strategic relationships. If Talarian fails to develop these strategic
relationships, or if any of

Talarian's current relationships with these types of organizations is
terminated, Talarian might lose important revenue opportunities and its growth
might be limited.

If Talarian fails to continue to penetrate key target markets, such as the
financial services market, or if these markets fail to grow as anticipated, its
revenue growth will be impaired.

   Talarian is focusing its engineering and sales and marketing resources to
penetrate the financial services, aerospace, and high technology manufacturing
(hardware and software original equipment manufacturers and independent
software vendors) markets. If Talarian fails to address the needs of these key
markets, its revenue growth will be impaired. In recent years, Talarian has
directed its sales and marketing efforts toward companies in such diverse
industries as financial services, business-to-business e-commerce,
telecommunications, high technology manufacturers (hardware and software
companies), embedded operating systems, cable television, transportation, and
aerospace industries. In fiscal 2001, less than 20% of Talarian's revenue was
derived from customers in markets outside the financial services, aerospace,
and high technology manufacturing markets. While Talarian will be focusing on
the markets in which it expects to derive a majority of its revenue, Talarian
will be more vulnerable to economic downturns or other adverse conditions
affecting these key markets. Additionally, these markets are rapidly changing.
Customers in these markets may require Talarian to change its product design or
features, sales methods, support capabilities or pricing policies. The costs of
addressing these requirements, as well as the failure to do so, could be
substantial and could adversely affect Talarian's operating results.

Doing business outside the United States involves numerous risks that could
negatively affect Talarian's financial results.

   Approximately 12% of Talarian's revenue was derived from international
sources in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and approximately 18% of
Talarian's revenue was derived from international sources in fiscal 2001. To
service the needs of these customers, Talarian must provide worldwide product
support and services. International operations require significant management
attention and financial resources that could adversely affect Talarian's
operating margins and earnings. Talarian may not be able to maintain or
increase international market demand for its products. In such event,
Talarian's international sales will be limited, and its business, operating
results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In
attempting to conduct and expand business internationally, Talarian would
remain exposed to various risks that could adversely affect its international
operations and, consequently, its operating results, including:

    .  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;

    .  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

    .  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of
       currency exchange controls, applicable to Talarian's business or to the
       Internet;

    .  difficulties and additional costs of tailoring Talarian's products to
       meet the demands of foreign markets;

    .  political and economic instability; and

    .  potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights.

The loss of key management personnel, on whose knowledge, leadership and
technical expertise Talarian relies, would adversely affect Talarian's ability
to execute its business plan.

   Talarian's success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its
key management personnel, whose knowledge, leadership, and technical expertise
would be difficult to replace. In particular, Talarian relies

upon the leadership of Paul A. Larson, its President and Chief Executive
Officer, and Thomas J. Laffey, its Chief Technical Officer. If Talarian were to
lose the services of any of its key personnel, its ability to execute its
business plan would be adversely affected. All of Talarian's executive officers
and key personnel are employees at-will. Talarian maintains no key person
insurance other than $500,000 on Thomas J. Laffey and $500,000 on Paul A.
Larson.

Talarian's software products may have unknown defects, which could harm
Talarian's reputation, decrease market acceptance of its products, cause
Talarian to lose customers and revenue, and result in liability.

   Talarian's products are created using highly complex software, both
internally developed and licensed from third parties. Highly complex software
may contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new
versions or enhancements are released. Talarian may not discover software
defects that affect its current or future products or enhancements until after
they are sold. Any interruptions caused by unknown defects in Talarian's
products could cause substantial damage to its customers' businesses and could
damage Talarian's reputation, cause its customers to initiate product liability
suits against Talarian, increase product development costs, divert its product
development resources, cause Talarian to lose revenue or delay market
acceptance of its products.

Talarian could receive negative publicity and suffer injury to its reputation
if well-known customers suffer service interruptions.

   Many of Talarian's customers, including financial exchanges,
telecommunications companies and large-scale independent software vendors, rely
upon Talarian's infrastructure software to provide widely used and highly
publicized services. If any of these customers were to suffer a service
interruption, Talarian could receive negative publicity and suffer injury to
its reputation even if these interruptions were wholly unrelated to the
performance of Talarian's products. The degree of this injury could be grossly
disproportionate to the actual contribution of Talarian's products to the
service interruption.

Talarian's products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others,
which may cause Talarian to become subject to expensive litigation, cause
Talarian to incur substantial damages or license fees, or prevent Talarian from
selling its products.

   Talarian cannot be certain that its products do not and will not infringe
issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically,
patent applications in the United States have not been publicly disclosed until
the patent is issued, and Talarian may not be aware of filed patent
applications that relate to its products or technology. If patents later issue
on these applications, Talarian may be liable for infringement. Talarian may
also be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its
business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks
and other intellectual property rights of third parties by Talarian or its
licensees in connection with their use of Talarian's products. Intellectual
property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert
Talarian's management's attention away from operating Talarian's business. If
Talarian discovered that its products infringe the intellectual property rights
of others, Talarian would need to obtain licenses from these parties or
substantially reengineer its products in order to avoid infringement. Talarian
might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at
all, or to reengineer its products successfully. Moreover, if Talarian is sued
for infringement and loses the suit, Talarian could be required to pay
substantial damages or enjoined from licensing or using the infringing products
or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause Talarian to incur significant
costs and prevent Talarian from selling its products.

Talarian's intellectual property could be used by others without Talarian's
consent.

   Talarian relies primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade
secret laws, and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to
protect its proprietary rights. Talarian does not currently own any issued
patents, and other protection of Talarian's intellectual property will not
prevent third parties from

independently developing similar or competitive technology. Moreover, despite
Talarian's efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may
copy aspects of Talarian's products and obtain and use information that
Talarian regards as proprietary. In addition, other parties may breach
confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts into which Talarian
has entered, and Talarian may not be able to enforce its rights in the event of
these breaches. Furthermore, Talarian expects that its international operations
will be increased in the future, and the laws of many foreign countries do not
protect Talarian's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws
of the United States.

                    ANNUAL MEETING OF TALARIAN STOCKHOLDERS

   Talarian is furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to you in order to
provide you with important information regarding the merger and the other
matters that are, or may come, properly before the Talarian annual meeting in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by Talarian's board of directors
for use at the annual meeting of the Talarian stockholders and at any
adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting. Talarian first mailed this
proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying proxy card to its stockholders
on or about              , 2002.

Date, Time and Place of the Annual Meeting

   Talarian will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders on       ,
      , 2002 at       :00 a.m., Pacific Time, at       . The principal
executive offices of Talarian are located at 333 Distel Circle, Los Altos,
California 94022.

Matters to be Considered at the Annual Meeting

   At the annual meeting, Talarian stockholders will be asked:

    1. To approve and adopt the merger and the merger agreement.

    2. To elect two Class II directors to hold office, each to serve until the
       earlier of the expiration of a three year term (or until his successor
       has been elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or
       removal) or the consummation of the merger. The Talarian board of
       directors intends to present the following nominees for election as
       directors:

    Class II Directors:  Paul D. Callahan
        Brian T. Horey

    3. To ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as Talarian's independent auditors
       for the year ending September 30, 2002.

    4. To transact any other business that may properly come before the annual
       meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

   The Talarian board of directors does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action at
the annual meeting. As to any business that may properly come before the annual
meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, however, it is
intended that proxies, in the form enclosed with this proxy
statement/prospectus, will be voted in respect thereof in accordance with the
judgment of the persons voting such proxies.

Recommendation of Talarian's Board of Directors

   After careful consideration, the Talarian board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The Talarian board of directors believes
that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, Talarian and its stockholders. The Talarian board of
directors unanimously recommends that its stockholders vote FOR the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

   The Talarian board of directors also unanimously recommends that the
Talarian stockholders vote FOR the election of each of the nominated Class II
directors and FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Talarian's
independent auditors.

Record Date

   The record date for determining the Talarian stockholders entitled to vote
at the annual meeting is              , 2002. Only holders of record of
Talarian common stock at the close of business on that date are entitled to
vote at the annual meeting. As of the record date, there were        shares of
Talarian common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately
stockholders of record. As of the record date, the directors and executive
officers of Talarian and their affiliates held        outstanding shares of
Talarian common stock. Each share of Talarian common stock issued and
outstanding as of the record date entitles its holder to cast one vote at the
annual meeting.

Quorum

   In order to conduct business at the annual meeting, a quorum must be
present. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the annual
meeting is holders, present in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares
of Talarian common stock issued and outstanding on the record date. Talarian
will treat shares of common stock represented by a properly signed and returned
proxy, including abstentions and broker non-votes, as present at the meeting
for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. If sufficient votes to
constitute a quorum or to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger
are not received by the date of the annual meeting, the persons named as
proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the meeting to permit further
solicitation of proxies. Adjournment would require the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Talarian common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting. The persons named as
proxies would generally exercise their authority to vote in favor of
adjournment.

Vote Required

   Each share of Talarian common stock issued and outstanding as of the record
date entitles its holder to cast one vote at the annual meeting. Holders of
Talarian common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting. The inspector of
elections appointed for the annual meeting will tabulate the votes.

   Proposal No. 1.  A majority of the shares of Talarian common stock
outstanding on the record date must be voted for the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger in order for the proposal to pass.

   Proposal No. 2.  With respect to proposal No. 2, two Class II directors will
be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of Talarian common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and voting on
the election of directors.

   Proposal No. 3.  Approval of proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares of Talarian common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

Voting of Proxies

   The proxy accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus is solicited on
behalf of the Talarian board of directors for use at the annual meeting.

   General.   Shares represented by a properly signed and dated proxy will be
voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on
the proxy. Proxies that are properly signed and dated but which do not contain
voting instructions will be voted FOR each of the proposals, or, in the case of
proposal No. 2, as a vote FOR the election of each of the director nominees.
The proxy holder may vote the proxy in its discretion as to any other matter
that may properly come before the meeting.

   Abstentions.  A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" will not be voted
for or against any proposal to be voted upon at the annual meeting. Because the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Talarian common
stock is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, if
you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN," it will have the effect of a vote against
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. Because the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Talarian common stock present
in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting is required to approve
proposal No. 3, if you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to such proposal,
it will have the effect of a vote against approval of such proposal. Because
only votes cast determine the outcome of the vote on proposal No. 2, if you
mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to such proposal, it will have no effect
on that proposal.

   Broker Non-Votes.   If your shares are held by your broker, your broker will
vote your shares for you only if you provide instructions to your broker on how
to vote your shares. You should follow the directions provided by your broker
regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Your broker cannot
vote your shares of Talarian common stock without specific instructions from
you. Because the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Talarian common stock is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
the merger, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, it will have the
effect of a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger. Because only votes cast determine the outcome of the vote on proposals
No. 2 and 3, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your proxy will
have no effect on these proposals.

   Voting Shares Held in Person that are Held Through Brokers.   If your shares
are held of record by your broker, bank or another nominee and you wish to vote
those shares in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain from the nominee
holding your Talarian common stock a properly executed legal proxy identifying
you as a Talarian stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf of the nominee
at the Talarian annual meeting and identifying the number of shares with
respect to which the authorization is granted.

How to Revoke a Proxy

   If you submit a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is voted by:

    .  delivering to the secretary of Talarian a written notice, dated later
       than the proxy you wish to revoke, stating that the proxy is revoked;

    .  submitting to the secretary of Talarian a new, signed proxy with a later
       date than the proxy you wish to revoke; or

    .  attending the annual meeting and voting in person.

   Notices to the secretary of Talarian should be addressed to Secretary,
Talarian Corporation, 333 Distel Circle, Los Altos, California 94022.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

   Talarian will pay its own expenses for soliciting proxies. Talarian has
hired a proxy solicitation firm, Automatic Data Processing, Inc., to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from Talarian stockholders. Automatic Data
Processing will receive customary fees and expenses reimbursement for these
services. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and
employees of Talarian may solicit proxies, without additional remuneration, by
telephone, facsimile, electronic mail and in person. Talarian will request
brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians to forward proxy materials
to beneficial owners of Talarian common stock, and Talarian will reimburse them
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

   Talarian stockholders should not send their stock certificates with their
proxies. A letter of transmittal with instructions for surrender of Talarian
common stock certificates will be mailed to the Talarian stockholders as soon
as practicable after the completion of the merger.

Voting Agreements

   Nine Talarian stockholders holding approximately       % of the outstanding
voting power of Talarian common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting
have agreed to vote all of their shares of Talarian common stock in favor of
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, and against
competing proposals for the acquisition of Talarian and have executed proxies
with respect to their shares in favor of TIBCO.

Appraisal Rights

   Under Delaware law, Talarian stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights
with respect to the merger and, if the merger is completed, to receive payment
in cash for the fair value of their shares of Talarian common stock. In
general, to preserve their appraisal rights, Talarian stockholders who wish to
exercise these rights must:

   .   deliver a written demand for appraisal to Talarian at or before the time
       the vote is taken at the Talarian annual meeting;

   .   not vote their shares for approval and adoption of the merger and the
       merger agreement;

   .   continuously hold their shares of Talarian common stock from the date
       they make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger; and

   .   comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
       Delaware General Corporation Law.

The text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law governing
appraisal rights is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.
Your failure to comply with the procedures described in Annex D will result in
the loss of appraisal rights. You are encouraged to read the text of Section
262 governing appraisal rights carefully and "Proposal No. 1--The
Merger--Appraisal Rights" in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Future Stockholder Proposals of Talarian

   If the merger is not completed, Talarian will convene a 2003 annual meeting
of stockholders. Proposals of stockholders for inclusion in Talarian's proxy
statement and form of proxy relating to Talarian's 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders must be received by              , 2002. Stockholder proposals
received by Talarian at its principal executive offices after              ,
2003 will be considered untimely. Stockholders should address their proposals
to Secretary, Talarian Corporation, 333 Distel Circle, Los Altos, California
94022.

                          PROPOSAL NO. 1--THE MERGER

   This section of this proxy statement/prospectus describes the principal
aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement. While TIBCO and
Talarian believe that this description covers the material terms of the merger
and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to Talarian stockholders. You can obtain a more
complete understanding of the merger by reading the merger agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are
encouraged to read the merger agreement and the other annexes to this proxy
statement/prospectus carefully and in their entirety.

Background of the Merger

   On December 10, 1999, Vivek Y. Ranadive, President and Chief Executive
Officer of TIBCO, contacted Paul A. Larson, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Talarian, to discuss a potential business combination or strategic
licensing transaction between the two companies. Following one meeting, the
companies discontinued discussions due to differences regarding valuation and
other issues, and Talarian proceeded with its initial public offering in July
2000.

   In late October 2000, at TIBCO's request, Mr. Larson met with Rajesh
Mashruwala, Executive Vice President of TIBCO, and subsequently, with Mr.
Mashruwala, Murray Rode, Chief Corporate Development Officer of TIBCO, and
Christopher G. O'Meara, then Vice President of Finance of TIBCO (now Executive
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer), to discuss a potential business
combination between TIBCO and Talarian. Further discussions were again
discontinued by Talarian over valuation issues.

   Commencing in late-February 2001 and continuing through Lehman Brothers'
formal engagement in September 2001, Talarian executives held a number of
discussions with representatives of Lehman Brothers regarding strategic
opportunities for Talarian.

   In April 2001, Talarian was contacted by another company, Company A,
regarding a potential business combination or other strategic relationship
between the companies. These discussions continued through the spring and
summer of 2001. In late-July, 2001, Talarian provided Company A with due
diligence materials regarding Talarian. Also in late-July, 2001, Mr. Rode
contacted Michael Morgan, Chief Financial Officer of Talarian, to initiate
further discussions between TIBCO and Talarian.

   On August 6, 2001, Thomas J. Laffey, Vice President and Chief Technical
Officer of Talarian, and Mr. Morgan met with Messrs. Mashruwala, Rode, O'Meara
and Hemanth Parasuram, Associate Director, Corporate Development, of TIBCO,
regarding a potential business combination between the companies. Later that
day, Messrs. Laffey and Morgan met with executives of Company A regarding a
potential business combination between Talarian and Company A.

   On August 17, 2001, the Talarian board of directors appointed directors Paul
Callahan, David Gold and Brian Horey as a strategic opportunities committee to
review and evaluate strategic alternatives available to Talarian. On August 22
and 23, 2001, the strategic opportunities committee held meetings with Talarian
management to review potential business combination and other strategic
transaction opportunities and to discuss the formal engagement of Lehman
Brothers.

   During the week of August 27, 2001, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Rode met to further
discuss aspects of a strategic transaction between TIBCO and Talarian. On
August 28 and 29, 2001, the strategic opportunities committee of the Talarian
board of directors held further meetings with Talarian management to examine
the strategic alternatives facing Talarian and other potential partners for a
strategic transaction. Following these meetings, Messrs. Larson, Laffey and
Morgan discussed with representatives of Lehman Brothers the status of
discussions with TIBCO and Company A, as well as having Lehman Brothers contact
additional companies that could

potentially be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Talarian.
Shortly following these meetings, discussions with Company A were terminated
due to valuation issues, declines in Company A's stock price and a shift in
strategic focus at Company A.

   On September 5, 2001, Messrs. Larson, Laffey, Morgan and Mark Mahowald,
Chief Operating Officer of Talarian, met with Messrs. Ranadive, Rode and
Parasuram, during which the parties discussed a potential business combination,
the TIBCO management discussed TIBCO's business plans and gave the Talarian
executives a tour of TIBCO's facilities.

   On September 7, 2001, executives of another company, Company B, contacted
Mr. Morgan to discuss a potential business combination transaction between
Talarian and Company B and to exchange information regarding their respective
businesses. An additional meeting between such executives regarding such
matters was held on September 10, 2001.

   On September 14, 2001, the Talarian board of directors met and, among other
things, reviewed the status of the various strategic alternatives then under
consideration. At this meeting, the Talarian board of directors appointed
director David Caplan to the strategic opportunities committee, replacing Brian
Horey who had resigned on August 29, 2001. Also on September 14, Talarian
formally engaged Lehman Brothers to act as Talarian's exclusive financial
advisor to identify strategic opportunities for Talarian and assist the company
in evaluating and negotiating terms of any potential strategic transactions.

   Following this meeting, Talarian management and representatives of Lehman
Brothers further considered the companies that could potentially be interested
in pursuing a business combination or other strategic transaction with Talarian
and such companies' respective business strategies, market valuations and
financial abilities to pursue and consummate such a transaction. As a result of
such analysis, under the direction of the Talarian board strategic
opportunities committee, during the months of September, October and November
2001, representatives of Lehman Brothers contacted the eight companies
(including TIBCO, Company A and Company B) that the board had determined would
likely be interested in evaluating a potential business combination or other
strategic transaction with Talarian. Although several meetings were held
between Lehman Brothers and Talarian personnel and representatives of some of
these parties, other than TIBCO and Company B, each of the companies ultimately
responded that they were either unable to, or not interested in, pursuing any
such transaction with Talarian at such time.

   At an October 12, 2001 meeting of the Talarian board of directors, Mr.
Larson discussed with the board the status of Lehman Brothers' contacts with
the potentially interested parties. On October 16, 2001, the strategic
opportunities committee of the Talarian board met with representatives of
Lehman Brothers to further discuss the results of these contacts.

   On November 16, 2001, the Talarian board of directors met and, among other
things, reviewed with Mr. Larson the status of Lehman Brothers' contacts with
the potentially interested parties. On November 19, 2001, members of TIBCO's
management met with Messrs. Larson, Laffey, Morgan and David Gold, a Talarian
director, and representatives of Lehman Brothers to discuss aspects of a
business combination between the companies. Later that evening Messrs. Laffey,
Larson, Gold, Mashruwala, O'Meara and Parasuram and representatives of Lehman
Brothers attended a dinner meeting.

   On December 4, 2001, Company B conducted an all-day due diligence session
with Talarian management and representatives of Lehman Brothers. From December
11, 2001 through December 18, 2001, members of Talarian's management held a
series of teleconference meetings with Company B executives to review
additional due diligence matters regarding Talarian.

   On December 14, 2001, the Talarian board of directors met with
representatives of its outside legal counsel, Fenwick & West LLP, to, among
other things, discuss the status of contacts with the parties potentially
interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with the company.

   On December 20, 2001, Company B contacted Lehman Brothers to make a
preliminary proposal regarding a transaction in which it would acquire Talarian
and requested that Talarian enter into an exclusive negotiating period
regarding any strategic transaction involving Talarian. On the evening of
December 20, 2001 the Talarian board of directors held a meeting with
representatives of Lehman Brothers and Fenwick & West to discuss the terms
proposed by Company B and whether Talarian should enter into an exclusive
negotiating period. At this meeting, the board authorized Talarian's management
to negotiate with Company B acceptable terms under which Talarian would enter
into an exclusivity agreement.

   On December 21, 2001, representatives of Company B's legal counsel and
Fenwick & West commenced negotiations on exclusivity terms. Also on December
21, representatives of Lehman Brothers and Messrs. Mashruwala and Rode of TIBCO
held discussions following which TIBCO informed Lehman Brothers that it was
interested in potentially acquiring Talarian. On the evening of December 21,
the strategic opportunities committee of the Talarian board of directors met by
teleconference to discuss the potential transactions with TIBCO and Company B
and determined that Talarian and its advisors should pursue non-exclusive
parallel discussions with both potentially interested parties. Following this
meeting, representatives of Talarian, Lehman Brothers and Fenwick & West
contacted representatives of both TIBCO and Company B to notify them that
Talarian would be willing to engage in parallel negotiations regarding a
strategic transaction but would not enter into exclusive discussions with
either party.

   On December 22 and 23, 2001, representatives of TIBCO and Talarian, their
legal advisors and Lehman Brothers discussed potential terms for a business
combination between the companies.

   On December 23, 2001, the Talarian board of directors held a meeting with
representatives of Lehman Brothers and Fenwick & West to discuss the status and
substance of the negotiations with TIBCO. Following discussion, the Talarian
board of directors authorized Talarian management and its advisors to continue
negotiations with TIBCO and Company B. Despite invitations by Lehman Brothers
and Talarian management to do so, Company B elected not to continue its
negotiations with Talarian.

   From December 24, 2001 through January 3, 2002, representatives of TIBCO and
Venture Law Group, outside counsel to TIBCO, performed a due diligence
investigation of Talarian, including receiving presentations by Talarian
management and Lehman Brothers regarding Talarian's business and finances, and
reviewing Talarian's legal and business documents.

   On December 27, 2001, Venture Law Group provided Talarian with a draft
definitive merger agreement and form of voting agreement. From December 28,
2001 through January 4, 2002, representatives of Fenwick & West and Venture Law
Group negotiated the terms of the transaction documents.

   On December 29, 2001, members of TIBCO management reviewed TIBCO's business,
products and financial position with Messrs. Morgan and Laffey and
representatives of Lehman Brothers.

   On December 30, 2001, the Talarian board of directors held a meeting with
representatives of Lehman Brothers and Fenwick & West to discuss the
negotiations with TIBCO. The board also discussed with its advisors the results
of Lehman Brothers' and Talarian management's business due diligence analysis
of TIBCO.

   On January 2, 2002, the TIBCO board of directors met with senior management
and in-house counsel at a special meeting of the board to review the status of
the negotiations with Talarian, the terms of the merger and TIBCO's due
diligence review of Talarian. At this meeting, TIBCO's management reviewed the
proposed financial terms and other terms of the merger with the board,
including the proposed per share purchase price and conversion price of
outstanding Talarian common stock and options of $5.30 per share, half in TIBCO
common stock and half in cash. Following these presentations, the board engaged
in a full discussion of the terms of the proposed transaction and its
advisability. At the conclusion of this meeting, TIBCO's board of directors
approved the terms of the merger and authorized management to proceed with the
execution of the transaction documents.

   On January 2, 2002, TIBCO notified Talarian that it was prepared to enter
into a merger agreement providing for $5.30 in value for each Talarian share
and option, half in cash and half in TIBCO stock, on substantially the terms
and conditions set forth in the merger agreement. Following this discussion,
the Talarian board met with its financial and legal advisors to discuss the
TIBCO transaction. At this meeting, representatives of Fenwick & West provided
the board with a detailed review of the proposed terms of the transaction
agreements. Representatives of Lehman Brothers made a presentation to the board
of their preliminary valuation analysis of the proposed transaction. Following
discussion, the board authorized the company's management to continue final
negotiations on the transaction. Also on January 2, 2002, TIBCO provided Mr.
Laffey with a draft employment agreement and non-competition agreement. These
agreements were negotiated over the next two days.

   On the evening of January 3, 2002, the Talarian board of directors met to
consider the proposed transaction with TIBCO. Representatives of Fenwick & West
reviewed with the board proposed resolutions for the remaining open issues in
the transaction documents. Representatives of Lehman Brothers provided an
updated financial analysis of the transaction, and delivered to the board its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that the consideration to be
received by Talarian stockholders in the transaction is fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view. Following discussion, the Talarian
board unanimously approved the merger and related transaction matters.

   Late in the evening of January 4, 2002, the transaction documents were
executed by the parties to such agreements. On January 5, 2002, TIBCO and
Talarian issued a joint press release publicly announcing the transaction.

Reasons for the Merger

   TIBCO's Reasons for the Merger.  TIBCO's board of directors and management
believe that the merger will benefit TIBCO and its stockholders for the
following reasons:

    .  Extension of Product Line and Technology Capabilities.  The acquisition
       of Talarian will extend TIBCO's leadership in offering messaging
       solutions for the fast-growing business integration market. Talarian's
       products will provide complementary functionality to TIBCO's current
       messaging technologies for certain applications in industries that are
       important to TIBCO. TIBCO believes that complementary solutions will
       provide additional revenue opportunities from current customers.

    .  Expansion of Customer Base.  The merger of TIBCO and Talarian will
       provide TIBCO with access to Talarian's 300 customers focused mainly in
       the financial services, telecommunications and aerospace industries.
       TIBCO believes that this access will provide additional revenue from
       these customers as it opens up sales channels for TIBCO's current
       product lines.

    .  Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The terms of the merger agreement and
       related agreements, including price and structure, are considered by
       both the TIBCO board of directors and senior management to provide a
       fair and equitable basis for the merger.

   Talarian's Reasons for the Merger.  The Talarian board of directors has
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to,
and in the best interests of, Talarian and its stockholders. In reaching its
unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the Talarian
board of directors consulted Talarian's management, financial advisors and
legal counsel, and identified and considered many factors which, when taken as
a whole, supported its decision. The Talarian board of directors considered the
following material information and factors in reaching its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger:

    .  The board considered that the $5.30 price proposed in the merger
       represented a 76.7% premium to the $3.00 closing price of Talarian
       common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on January 3, 2002, the last
       full trading day prior to the board's meeting on January 4, 2002 to
       approve the merger, a premium of 101.5% to the average closing price of
       Talarian common stock for the 30 consecutive trading day period prior to
       January 3, 2002 and a premium of 165.0% to the average closing price of
       Talarian

       common stock for the 90 consecutive trading day period prior to January
       3, 2002. The board also considered current financial market conditions
       and the historic volatility and trading prices of Talarian common stock
       and TIBCO common stock, as well as the board's expectations regarding
       the potential for future increases in the trading prices of the two
       stocks.

    .  The board considered that $2.65 of the merger consideration to be
       received by the Talarian stockholders will be paid in cash, ensuring the
       delivery of a certain amount of fixed value to Talarian stockholders
       despite overall stock market or software industry volatility or adverse
       changes in TIBCO's business or common stock price. In agreeing to a
       transaction containing this fixed cash consideration, the board also
       sought to ensure that Talarian stockholders would benefit from
       Talarian's own cash position.

    .  The board considered that the portion of the merger consideration to be
       delivered in TIBCO common stock will reflect a value equal to $2.65 if
       the average closing price of TIBCO stock during the ten trading days
       preceding the closing of the transaction is between $16.21 and $12.16,
       that this structure delivers certain value if TIBCO stock is within such
       range and a beneficial, asymmetrical "collar" that permits Talarian
       stockholders to benefit from a fixed exchange ratio if such closing
       value for TIBCO common stock exceeds $16.21, an increase of only 2.4%
       from the $15.83 closing price of TIBCO stock on January 3, 2002, the
       last full trading day prior to the board's meeting on January 4, 2002 to
       approve the merger, but that for the fixed exchange ratio to adversely
       affect Talarian stockholders, TIBCO common stock would have to decline
       below $12.16, a more than 23.2% decrease from its $15.83 closing price
       on January 3, 2002.

    .  The board considered favorably the analyses and presentation of Lehman
       Brothers on the financial aspects of the merger, including its opinion
       to the Talarian board of directors, dated as of January 3, 2002, as to
       the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Talarian
       common stock of the merger consideration to be received by the holders
       of Talarian common stock in the merger.

    .  The board considered the significantly larger market capitalization of
       TIBCO than Talarian and the corresponding increase in trading liquidity
       for Talarian stockholders as a result of the merger.

    .  The board considered favorably the terms of the merger agreement,
       including the limited conditions to closing the merger, TIBCO's limited
       rights to terminate the merger agreement, and Talarian's rights under
       the merger agreement to consider superior acquisition proposals and to
       alter its recommendation to approve the merger should it determine that
       its fiduciary duties to Talarian stockholders so require.

    .  The board considered the likelihood that TIBCO and Talarian would be
       able to complete the merger, including their ability to obtain the
       necessary regulatory approvals.

    .  The board considered the expected tax treatment of the merger for United
       States federal income tax purposes, including the possibility that the
       merger would not be treated as a "reorganization" under the tax code,
       but that in any event, Talarian stockholders would receive in the merger
       cash and registered shares of a highly liquid security.

    .  The board considered that it had reviewed with its financial advisor the
       companies that would potentially be interested in pursuing a business
       combination or other strategic transaction with Talarian and such
       companies' respective market capitalizations and financial abilities to
       pursue and consummate such a transaction, and at the board's direction,
       had Talarian's financial advisor contact those that the board, Talarian
       management and such financial advisor considered likely to be interested
       in evaluating an acquisition of or business combination with Talarian,
       and that such parties either were not interested in such a transaction
       or expressed interest in a transaction that would deliver significantly
       less value to Talarian stockholders than the merger.

    .  The board considered the opportunity for existing Talarian stockholders
       to participate in the future growth of TIBCO, whose resources combined
       with those of Talarian may enhance the combined company's ability to
       respond more quickly and effectively to increased competition and
       demands in targeted markets.

    .  The board considered the nature of each of TIBCO's and Talarian's
       products and services and the potential for the product and service
       offerings of the combined company to extend the breadth and
       functionality of infrastructure software products and services for
       businesses to exchange information in real time, both internally and
       with their partners, suppliers and customers.

    .  The board considered the ability of the combined company to take
       advantage of the technology, research and development resources, and
       deployment expertise of Talarian and TIBCO in order to bring new
       products and services to market in a timely fashion.

    .  The board considered the opportunities and risks of continuing to
       operate Talarian as an independent company and the difficulties of
       competing in rapidly evolving and highly competitive markets with
       enterprise application vendors, infrastructure software providers and
       operating system software vendors, many of whom have significantly
       larger product lines, sales and marketing capabilities and financial
       resources than Talarian, and the Talarian board's conclusion that a
       combination with TIBCO is a superior alternative.

    .  The board considered historical information concerning TIBCO's and
       Talarian's respective businesses, financial performance and condition,
       operations, prospects, technology, management, competitive position and
       stock performance.

   In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger and
to recommend approval of the merger agreement and the merger to Talarian's
stockholders, Talarian's board of directors also considered a number of
potentially negative factors concerning the merger. These factors included the
following:

    .  The board considered the possible effects of the public announcement of
       the merger on Talarian's sales and its relationships with its suppliers,
       customers and employees as a result of the merger.

    .  The board considered the risk to Talarian's business, sales, operations
       and financial results in the event that the merger is not consummated.

    .  The board considered the risk that because the merger provides for a
       "collar" on the adjustment of the exchange ratio, if the average closing
       price of TIBCO common stock used to determine the exchange ratio is
       below $12.16, the value to be received by Talarian stockholders in the
       merger will be less than $5.30.

    .  The board considered the risks of diverting management focus and
       resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational
       matters while working to implement the merger with TIBCO.

    .  The board considered the challenges of combining the businesses, assets
       and workforces of Talarian and TIBCO and the risks of not achieving
       anticipated business, technological and financial synergies of the
       combination, as well as other matters that might adversely affect the
       trading price of the TIBCO common stock received in the merger.

    .  The board considered the number of Talarian shares covered by the voting
       agreement with TIBCO as well as the termination fee payable to TIBCO in
       certain events involving another transaction, and the potential effect
       of such factors in deterring other potential acquirors from proposing an
       alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Talarian
       stockholders than the merger.

   In addition, Talarian's board of directors considered the interests that its
officers and directors may have with respect to the merger in addition to their
interests as Talarian stockholders. See "--Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger" on page 49 for a more complete discussion of these interests.

   After due consideration, the Talarian board of directors concluded that the
risks associated with the proposed merger were outweighed by the potential
benefits of the merger.

   The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
Talarian's board of directors are not intended to be exhaustive but are
believed to include all of the material factors considered by Talarian's board.
In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered,
Talarian's board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it
considered in approving the merger and the merger agreement. In addition,
individual members of Talarian's board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The Talarian board of directors considered all of
these factors as a whole, and overall considered them to be favorable to and to
support its determination.

Recommendation of Talarian's Board of Directors

   Talarian's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger, the
merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Talarian's board of directors believes that the merger agreement and
the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Talarian and
its stockholders, and recommends that its stockholders vote FOR the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

   If the merger is not completed, Talarian intends to continue as an
independent public company and will continue to evaluate other strategic
transactions or alternatives to realize value for its stockholders.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Talarian

   General.  Lehman Brothers has acted as financial advisor to Talarian in
connection with the merger. On January 3, 2002, Lehman Brothers rendered its
opinion to the Talarian board of directors that as of such date and, based upon
and subject to the matters stated in the opinion, from a financial point of
view, the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Talarian in the
merger, was fair to such stockholders.

   The full text of the Lehman Brothers' written opinion dated January 3, 2002
is included as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Holders of Talarian
common stock may read the Lehman Brothers opinion for a discussion of the
procedures followed, factors considered, assumptions made and qualifications
and limitations of the review undertaken by Lehman Brothers in connection with
its opinion. The following is a summary of the Lehman Brothers opinion and the
methodology that Lehman Brothers used to render its opinion.

   Lehman Brothers' advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of the Talarian board of directors in connection
with its consideration of the merger agreement. Lehman Brothers' opinion is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of
Talarian as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger.
Lehman Brothers was not requested to opine as to, and Lehman Brothers' opinion
does not address, Talarian's underlying business decision to proceed with or
effect the merger.

   In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

    .  the merger agreement and the specific terms of the merger;

    .  publicly available information concerning Talarian that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Talarian's annual
       report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 and
       quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2000,
       March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001;

    .  financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Talarian furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Talarian;

    .  publicly available estimates of the future financial performance of
       Talarian prepared by Lehman Brothers' research analyst;

    .  publicly available information concerning TIBCO that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including TIBCO's Annual Report
       on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2000, TIBCO's
       Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended February 28, May
       31, and August 31, 2001, and TIBCO's earnings press release for the
       quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2001;

    .  publicly available estimates of the future financial performance of
       TIBCO prepared by third party research analysts;

    .  a trading history of Talarian's common stock from January 2, 2001 to
       January 2, 2002 and a comparison of that trading history with that of
       other companies that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

    .  a trading history of TIBCO's common stock from January 2, 2001 to
       January 2, 2002 and a comparison of that trading history with that of
       other companies that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

    .  a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of Talarian with those of other companies that Lehman Brothers
       deemed relevant;

    .  a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of TIBCO with those of other companies that Lehman Brothers
       deemed relevant;

    .  a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

    .  the potential pro forma financial effects of the merger on TIBCO and a
       comparison of the relative contributions of Talarian and TIBCO to the
       combined company following the consummation of the merger; and

    .  the results of Lehman Brothers' efforts to solicit indications of
       interest in an acquisition of Talarian.

   In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the management of Talarian
and TIBCO concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets, financial
conditions and prospects, including the cost savings, operating synergies and
strategic benefits expected by the management of Talarian and TIBCO to result
from a combination of the businesses of Talarian and TIBCO, and have undertaken
such other studies, analyses and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed
appropriate.

   In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such
information. Lehman Brothers also relied upon the assurances of management of
Talarian and TIBCO that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would make such information inaccurate or misleading. Upon advice of Talarian,
Lehman Brothers assumed that the financial projections of Talarian were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of Talarian as to the future
financial performance of Talarian. However, for purposes of its analysis,
Lehman Brothers considered certain somewhat more conservative assumptions and
estimates which resulted in certain adjustments to the financial projections of
Talarian. Lehman Brothers discussed these adjusted projections with the
management of Talarian and they have agreed with the appropriateness of the use
of such adjusted projections in performing its analysis. With respect to the
financial projections of TIBCO, Lehman Brothers was not provided with, and did
not have any access to, financial forecasts or projections of TIBCO prepared by
management of TIBCO. Upon advice of TIBCO, Lehman Brothers assumed that the
published estimates of third party research analysts are a reasonable basis
upon which to evaluate the financial performance of TIBCO and that TIBCO will
perform substantially in accordance with such estimates. In arriving at its
opinion, Lehman Brothers did not conduct a physical inspection of the
properties and facilities of Talarian and TIBCO. Lehman Brothers also did not
make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of
Talarian and TIBCO.

   While Lehman Brothers assumed that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, Lehman Brothers understands that, under certain
circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement, the structure of the merger
would be changed and the

merger might not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Despite such a change in structure,
however, the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Talarian would
not change. Lehman Brothers' opinion was necessarily based upon market,
economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the
date of such opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific range
of value to Talarian or TIBCO, but rather made its determination as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be offered to
Talarian's stockholders by TIBCO in the merger on the basis of financial and
comparative analyses described below. The preparation of a fairness opinion
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial and comparative analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances, and therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Furthermore, Lehman Brothers did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each
analysis and factor. Accordingly, Lehman Brothers believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses
and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
In its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Talarian and TIBCO. None of
Talarian, TIBCO, Lehman Brothers or any other person assumes responsibility if
future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates
contained in these analyses were not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than as set forth in the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to
the value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses actually may be sold.

   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Lehman
Brothers in connection with rendering its opinion to the Talarian board of
directors. Some of the summaries of the financial and comparative analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the methodologies used by Lehman Brothers and the results of its financial and
comparative analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial and comparative analyses. Accordingly, the information presented in
the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Considering any
portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all
analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of the process underlying Lehman Brothers' opinion.

   Comparable Company Analysis.  Using publicly available information, Lehman
Brothers compared selected financial data of Talarian with similar data of
selected companies engaged in businesses considered by Lehman Brothers to be
comparable to that of Talarian. Specifically, Lehman Brothers included in its
review the following software companies:

    .  International Business Machines Corporation;

    .  IONA Technologies PLC;

    .  Level 8 Systems, Inc.;

    .  Mercator Software, Inc.;

    .  SeeBeyond Technology Corporation;

    .  Sybase, Inc.;

    .  TIBCO Software Inc.;

    .  Vitria Technology, Inc.; and

    .  webMethods, Inc.

   For each of Talarian and the selected software companies, Lehman Brothers
calculated the ratio of enterprise value to mean revenue estimates for the
calendar year 2001 and 2002 reported by First Call, which is a service widely
used by the investment community to gather estimates from various research
analysts. The enterprise value of each company was obtained by adding its short
and long term debt to the sum of the market value of its diluted common equity,
the value of any preferred stock and the book value of any minority interest,
and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents. Lehman Brothers then compared
those ratios for the selected companies to similar ratios calculated for
Talarian based on the merger consideration and estimates for Talarian's
Management Case and Downside Case revenue. The following table presents the
revenue multiples:

                                                            Enterprise Value/
                                                            Revenue Multiples
                                                            -----------------
     Comparable Company Multiples (as of 1/2/02):           CY 2001   CY 2002

     Talarian Management Case..............................  3.68x     2.36x
     Talarian Downside Case................................  3.68x     3.16x

     Mean of Selected Software Companies...................  3.63x     3.44x
     Median of Selected Software Companies.................  2.94x     2.70x

   Because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of Talarian and the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of the companies included in its comparable
company groups, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to rely
solely on the quantitative results of the analysis, and accordingly, also made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics of Talarian and the companies in its respective
comparable company groups that would affect the public trading values of
Talarian and the comparable companies. In particular, Lehman Brothers
considered markets served, rates of growth and profitability of Talarian and
each of the companies in the comparable company groups. Lehman Brothers
concluded that such analysis was supportive of its opinion as to the fairness
of the consideration to be offered to Talarian's stockholders in the merger.

   Comparable Transaction Analysis.  The comparable transaction analysis
provides a market benchmark based on the consideration paid in selected
comparable transactions. For this analysis, Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly
available information to determine the purchase prices and multiples paid in
eight acquisitions of public and private software companies since January 1,
1999.

   Lehman Brothers took the most comparable of these transactions and divided
the enterprise value of the relevant transactions by each of the following
revenue measurements from the acquired business: (1) the latest twelve months,
or LTM, and (2) the total revenue for the following four consecutive quarters,
or Forward 4Q. Lehman Brothers also adjusted these revenue multiples from the
announcement date of these transactions to December 31, 2001 based on the
change in Nasdaq Index value during the same period. The following table shows
the revenue multiples and the adjusted revenue multiples for the selected
transactions:

                                                                 Nasdaq Adjusted

                                              ----------------- -----------------
Comparable Transaction Multiples:              LTM   Forward 4Q  LTM   Forward 4Q
- ---------------------------------             -----  ---------- -----  ----------

TIBCO/Talarian Merger (Management Case)...... 3.68x    2.36x    3.68x    2.36x
TIBCO/Talarian Merger (Downside Case)........ 3.68x    3.16x    3.68x    3.16x

Mean of Selected Comparable Transactions..... 1.52x    1.24x    1.52x    1.22x
Median of Selected Comparable Transactions... 1.52x    1.24x    1.52x    1.22x

   Because the reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the
transactions analyzed were so diverse and because of the inherent differences
in the businesses, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Talarian
and the businesses, operations, and financial conditions of the companies
included in the comparable transactions group, Lehman Brothers believed that a
purely quantitative comparable transaction analysis would not be particularly
meaningful in the context of the merger. Lehman Brothers believed that the
appropriate use of

a comparable transaction analysis in this instance would involve qualitative
judgments concerning the differences between the characteristics of these
transactions and the merger which would affect the acquisition values of the
acquired companies and Talarian. In particular, Lehman Brothers considered
markets served, rates of growth and profitability of Talarian and each of the
acquired companies as well as business and market conditions existing at the
time of the merger as compared to those existing when these transactions were
executed. Lehman Brothers concluded that such analysis was supportive of its
opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to be offered to Talarian's
stockholders in the merger.

   Premiums Paid Analysis.  Using publicly available information, Lehman
Brothers reviewed the premiums paid, or proposed to be paid, in the case of
transactions pending as of the date of the Lehman Brothers opinion, in 19
acquisitions of public software companies and 34 acquisitions of public
technology companies with transaction values between $50 million and $150
million since January 1, 2001.

   Lehman Brothers calculated the premium per share paid by the acquirer
compared to the share price of the target company prevailing one day and one
month prior to delivering its opinion. Lehman Brothers compared the premiums
paid in the software and technology sectors to the premium to be paid by TIBCO
for Talarian in the merger. Lehman Brothers concluded that such analysis was
supportive of its opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to be offered
to Talarian's stockholders in the merger. The following table shows the 1-day
and 1-month premiums:

   Premium Paid (Premium to 1/2/2002):                         1 Day 1 Month

   Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Talarian Board selected Lehman
Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with Talarian and
the enterprise application integration industry generally and because its
investment banking professionals have substantial experience in transactions
comparable to the merger.

   As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Talarian has
agreed to pay Lehman Brothers a customary fee. In addition, Talarian has agreed
to reimburse Lehman Brothers for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the merger and to indemnify Lehman Brothers for certain
liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by Talarian and the rendering
of Lehman Brothers' opinion. Lehman Brothers has previously rendered investment
banking services to Talarian, including acting as lead managing underwriter for
Talarian's initial public offering in July of 2000, and received customary fees
for such services.

   In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in the debt or equity securities of Talarian and TIBCO for its own account and
for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the Talarian board of directors
regarding the merger, Talarian stockholders should be aware that some of
Talarian's stockholders, directors and officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, their interests as Talarian
stockholders. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The
Talarian board of directors was aware of these interests and took

these interests into account in approving the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

   Voting Agreement.  The following Talarian stockholders have entered into a
voting agreement and granted irrevocable proxies to TIBCO pursuant to which
they have agreed to vote shares of Talarian common stock for which they
exercise voting control in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger:

    .  Paul A. Larson, a director and the president and chief executive officer
       of Talarian.

    .  Thomas J. Laffey, a director and the vice president, chief technical
       officer and secretary of Talarian.

    .  Mark G. Mahowald, chief operating officer and vice president, multicast
       and networking technologies of Talarian.

    .  Michael A. Morgan, chief financial officer and vice president of finance
       and administration of Talarian.

    .  David E. Gold, a director of Talarian.

    .  Lawrence, Tyrrell, Ortale and Smith, L.P. Brian T. Horey, a director of
       Talarian, is a general partner of Lawrence, Tyrrell, Ortale and Smith,
       L.P.

    .  Nortel Networks, Inc. Paul D. Callahan, a director of Talarian, and
       former vice president, strategy and technology investments of Nortel
       Networks, Inc. was nominated to Talarian's board of directors by Nortel
       Networks, Inc.

    .  STF II, L.P. David E. Gold, a director of Talarian, is a general partner
       of STF II, L.P.

    .  The Caplan Family Trust dated August 10, 1999. David I. Caplan, a
       director of Talarian, is trustee of the Caplan Family Trust.

   Acceleration of Talarian Stock Options.   The Talarian stock options held by
each of Talarian's directors and officers will be assumed in the merger and
become exercisable, in accordance with their terms, for shares of TIBCO common
stock. Upon the merger, the vesting of stock options held by Brian T. Horey,
David E. Gold, David I. Caplan, Paul D. Callahan and Richard A. Nortz, all of
whom are non-employee directors of Talarian, will accelerate and become fully
vested. The vesting of the stock options of Michael A. Morgan, Thomas J.
Laffey, Rodney S. Arbaugh, Steven M. Gimnicher, Mark G. Mahowald, Carl R.
Schulenburg and Antonio J. Espinosa, all of whom are executive officers of
Talarian, will be accelerated so that 50% of the unvested shares subject to
these options will become vested. The vesting of the stock options of Paul A.
Larson and Thomas J. Laffey, each of whom is an executive officer and director
of Talarian, will also be accelerated so that 50% of the unvested shares
subject to these options will become vested.

   In addition, these executive officers will become entitled to acceleration
of stock options upon termination of their employment with Talarian on or
following completion of the merger. Under the terms of the option acceleration
side letters to Talarian's employment offer letters to Paul A. Larson, Michael
A. Morgan, Thomas J. Laffey, Rodney S. Arbaugh, Steven M. Gimnicher, Mark G.
Mahowald and Carl R. Schulenburg, if such officer's employment is terminated by
Talarian or TIBCO, other than for cause, within 60 days prior to or 12 months
after the closing of the merger, if such officer terminates his employment
because of an adverse and material change in compensation or duties, or if his
stock options do not continue in existence after the merger on substantially
the same or better terms as existed prior to the merger, any unvested shares
held by such officer will accelerate and immediately vest upon the later of the
closing of the merger or the termination of such officer's employment. Under
the terms of the option acceleration side letter to the employment offer letter
to Antonio J. Espinosa, if Talarian or TIBCO terminates Mr. Espinosa's
employment, other than for cause, after or in connection with the merger and
Mr. Espinosa is the Vice President, Sales of Talarian at the time of the
merger, any unvested shares held by Mr. Espinosa will accelerate and
immediately vest.

   Employment Arrangements.  Thomas J. Laffey, a director and the vice
president, chief technical officer and secretary of Talarian, has signed an
employment agreement with TIBCO to serve as a vice president of

TIBCO for a term of 18 months following the closing of the merger. Mr. Laffey's
employment agreement provides that in addition to his annual salary, he will
participate in TIBCO's bonus plan and will receive, subject to the approval of
TIBCO's board of directors, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of TIBCO
common stock with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of
grant that will vest at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of his
employment and in equal monthly increments over the next thirty-six months. In
addition, in the event TIBCO terminates Mr. Laffey's employment for any reason
other than for cause, death or disability, or if Mr. Laffey terminates his
employment because of an adverse change in his compensation, title, duties or
location of employment, the employment agreement provides for severance
benefits that include the payment of his annual salary on a monthly basis for
the longer of six months or the remaining term of his employment agreement, and
the acceleration of vesting of all unvested shares of TIBCO common stock
received by Mr. Laffey prior to the closing of the merger. Mr. Laffey also
signed TIBCO's standard proprietary information and inventions agreement, as
well as a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement. The agreements with
Mr. Laffey will become effective upon the consummation of the merger.

   In addition, some of the officers of Talarian may become employees of TIBCO.

   Loans to Executive Officers.   On July 15, 2001, Talarian loaned $106,816 to
Paul A. Larson, a director and the president and chief executive officer of
Talarian, and his wife Cheryl Larson, which will be repaid in full, together
with all accrued interest, on or prior to the closing of the merger.

   Indemnification.  The merger agreement provides that, upon the completion of
the merger, TIBCO will cause the surviving corporation, for a period of six
years following the closing of the merger, to indemnify and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all persons who are officers and directors
of Talarian as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger to the same
extent that these persons were indemnified or had the right to advancement of
expenses pursuant to Talarian's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of the merger agreement.

   The merger agreement also provides that, upon the completion of the merger,
TIBCO will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain, for a period of six years following the merger,
the policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Talarian on terms comparable to those applicable to the directors and officers
of Talarian in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, provided that
TIBCO and the surviving corporation will not be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 125% of the annual premiums paid by Talarian for
directors' and officers' liability insurance as of the date of the merger
agreement.

   As a result of interests described above, these officers and directors could
be more likely to vote to approve, and recommend the approval of, the merger
agreement and the merger, than if they did not hold these interests.

Litigation

   On January 8, 2002, an action, Robert Mathiason v. Talarian Corporation, et
al. was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County
of Santa Clara. In this action, the plaintiff named as defendants Talarian and
the directors of Talarian. The complaint purports to assert claims on behalf of
all public stockholders of Talarian who are similarly situated with the
plaintiff. The complaint generally alleges that Talarian and the directors of
Talarian have breached their fiduciary duties to Talarian's stockholders in
approving the merger, that the directors engaged in self-dealing in connection
with their approval of the merger and that, in approving the merger, the
directors failed to take steps to maximize the value of Talarian to its
stockholders. The complaint seeks class certification and certain forms of
equitable relief, including enjoining the consummation of the merger. Talarian
believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to defend against
the complaint vigorously. Talarian, however, cannot provide any assurance that
Talarian or the other defendants will be successful.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger

   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions precedent for
consummating the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by the stockholders of
Talarian. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Structure of the Merger

   The merger agreement provides that the merger will be structured as a
"forward triangular merger" (the merger of Talarian with and into Panther
Acquisition Corp., with Panther Acquisition Corp. continuing as the surviving
corporation). However, TIBCO may elect to change the structure of the merger to
a "reverse triangular merger" (the merger of Panther Acquisition Corp. with and
into Talarian, with Talarian continuing as the surviving corporation) if TIBCO
cannot obtain a tax opinion that the forward triangular merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or TIBCO reasonably determines in good faith that the
fair market value of the TIBCO common stock to be issued in the merger will not
equal at least 45% of the total fair market value of the aggregate merger
consideration, in each case determined as of the time the merger is completed.
If TIBCO undertakes the reverse triangular merger and if the TIBCO common stock
issued in the merger as of the time the merger is completed is at least equal
to 40% of the total fair market value of the aggregate merger consideration at
the time, Talarian will elect to require TIBCO to complete a "second-step
forward triangular merger," in which case Talarian (as the surviving
corporation of the initial reverse triangular merger) will be merged with and
into another direct, wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO, with such subsidiary of
TIBCO continuing as the ultimate surviving corporation. Each of these three
potential structures is referred to as the "merger" in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Due to the contingencies inherent in the selection of the
merger structure and particularly, the market value of TIBCO common stock prior
to the closing of the merger, the ultimate structure of the merger will not be
known until the merger is completed. For more information regarding the
material tax considerations of these potential merger structures, see "Proposal
No. 1--The Merger--Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations."

Conversion of Shares of Talarian Common Stock in the Merger

   If the merger is completed, each share of Talarian common stock that you own
(other than dissenting shares) will be automatically cancelled and converted
into the right to receive (a) $2.65 in cash, without interest, and (b) a
fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock equal to $2.65 divided by the average
closing trading price for TIBCO common stock, as defined below. Shares of
Talarian common stock held by Talarian, TIBCO or any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Talarian or TIBCO immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be
cancelled. The average closing trading price for TIBCO common stock is equal to
the average of the closing sales prices for one share of TIBCO common stock as
reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the 10 consecutive trading days
ending and including one day prior to the closing of the merger, provided that:

    .  if the average closing price is greater than $16.21, then the closing
       average trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the merger
       consideration is equal to $16.21;

    .  if the average closing price is less than $12.16, then the average
       closing trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the merger
       consideration is equal to $12.16; and

    .  if the average closing price is between $12.16 and $16.21, then the
       average closing trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the
       merger consideration is equal to that average closing price.

The number of shares of TIBCO common stock issuable to you in the merger will
be proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar event with
respect to TIBCO common stock or Talarian common stock effected between the
date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.

   TIBCO will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of TIBCO
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Talarian stockholders
will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fraction of a share of TIBCO
common stock.

Procedures for Exchanging Talarian Stock Certificates for TIBCO Stock
Certificates

   Promptly after the effective time of the merger, TIBCO will cause the
exchange agent to mail to you (a) a letter of transmittal and (b) instructions
on how to surrender Talarian stock certificates in exchange for cash and TIBCO
common stock certificates representing the merger consideration, cash for
fractional shares and cash for any dividends or other distributions that you
may be entitled to receive under the merger agreement. You should not surrender
your Talarian stock certificates until you receive the letter of transmittal
from the exchange agent.

   Upon surrendering your Talarian stock certificates, the letter of
transmittal and any other documents required by the exchange agent, you will be
entitled to receive cash, a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of TIBCO common stock which you have the right to receive, cash for
fractional shares of TIBCO common stock and cash for any dividends or other
distributions to which you are entitled. Until surrendered to the exchange
agent, your Talarian stock certificates will be deemed from and after the
effective time to evidence (a) only the ownership of the number of full shares
of TIBCO common stock into which your shares of Talarian common stock were
converted at the effective time, (b) the right to receive $2.65 per share and
(c) the right to receive an amount in cash for any fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions payable under the merger agreement.

   You will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
TIBCO common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
Talarian stock certificates in exchange for TIBCO stock certificates. TIBCO
does not anticipate paying any dividends with respect to its stock.

Governmental and Regulatory Matters

   The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, which prevents certain transactions from being completed
until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the
appropriate waiting periods end or expire. Each of TIBCO and Talarian has filed
the required information and materials with the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission. The requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino will be
satisfied if the merger is completed within one year from the termination of
the waiting period.

   The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after
the expiration of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after
the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the
antitrust laws. Certain other persons could take action under the antitrust
laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before
or after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable
waiting period expired or ended, any state could take action under the
antitrust laws. A challenge to the merger could be made and if a challenge is
made we may not prevail.

   In addition, we will make any necessary filings with foreign regulatory
agencies.

   Other than compliance with these antitrust laws, applicable federal and
state securities laws in connection with the issuance of the TIBCO common stock
pursuant to the merger, and applicable provisions of Delaware law, no United
States federal or state regulatory requirements must be complied with in order
to complete the merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

   The following discussion summarizes the anticipated material United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger that are generally applicable to
holders of Talarian common stock. This discussion is based on the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, all of which may change at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect. The tax consequences of the merger to you may vary
depending on your particular situation, and certain Talarian stockholders may
be subject to special tax treatment not discussed below, including stockholders
who are dealers in securities or foreign currency, foreign persons or entities,
financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, mutual funds, insurance
companies, persons who acquired their shares in connection with stock option or
stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions, persons who hold
their shares as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction, persons
who do not hold their Talarian common stock as capital assets, or persons who
are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code. In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax
consequences of other transactions effectuated prior to, concurrently, or after
the merger, whether or not such transactions are in connection with the merger,
including without limitation transactions in which shares of Talarian common
stock were or are acquired or shares of TIBCO common stock were or are disposed
of. Furthermore, no foreign, state or local tax considerations are addressed.
No ruling has been, or will be, obtained from the Internal Revenue Service
regarding the tax consequences of the merger, and the following discussion is
not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore, we urge you to consult
your own tax advisor as to the specific federal, state, local and foreign
consequences to you of the merger and related reporting obligations.

   Tax Considerations that Underlay the Determination of Merger Structure
Used.  The United States federal income tax consequences to you of the merger
may differ depending on whether the forward triangular merger structure, the
reverse triangular merger structure, or the reverse triangular merger followed
by a second-step forward triangular merger structure is used. It will not be
known earlier than the date of the completion of the merger which structure
will be used. Therefore, you will not know the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger to you at the time you vote on the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

   The forward triangular merger structure will only be used if TIBCO (a)
obtains a tax opinion that the forward triangular merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code and (b) reasonably determines in good faith that the fair market value of
the TIBCO common stock to be issued in the merger as of the time the merger is
completed will at least equal 45% of the total fair market value of the
aggregate merger consideration at that time. The forward triangular merger
structure can qualify as a reorganization only if a "continuity of interest"
requirement is satisfied. Continuity of interest requires that a substantial
part of the value of the proprietary interests in Talarian be preserved in the
merger by Talarian stockholders exchanging a substantial part of their
proprietary interests in Talarian for proprietary interests in TIBCO. There is
no clear specified minimum threshold for the continuity of interest
requirement. Nonetheless, the continuity of interest requirement will be
satisfied if the fair market value of TIBCO common stock issued by TIBCO to the
Talarian stockholders in the merger, determined as of the completion of the
merger, is at least 45% of the total fair market value as of the completion of
the merger of all of the merger consideration paid to or for the benefit of the
Talarian stockholders, and neither TIBCO nor any TIBCO affiliate or agent has a
plan or intention, directly or indirectly, to reacquire any of the TIBCO common
stock issued to the Talarian stockholders in the merger. Whether this threshold
will be met depends on factual circumstances that cannot be known for certain
until the completion of the merger, including in particular the trading price
of TIBCO common stock on The Nasdaq National Market at that time. If the
forward triangular merger structure were used and the continuity of interest
threshold were not satisfied, and if the merger thereby or otherwise failed to
qualify as a reorganization, a substantial corporate level tax would be
incurred.

   In an effort to avoid the imposition of a corporate level tax, TIBCO may
elect to change the structure of the merger from a forward triangular merger to
a reverse triangular merger. If, at the time of the closing, TIBCO determines
that the fair market value of TIBCO common stock paid by TIBCO to the Talarian
stockholders in the

merger, determined as of the completion of the merger, is at least 45% of the
total fair market value as of the completion of the merger of all of the merger
consideration paid to or for the benefit of the Talarian stockholders and it
has obtained an opinion that the merger will qualify as a reorganization, then
the forward triangular merger structure will be used. However, if at that time
of the closing, TIBCO reasonably determines in good faith that the combination
of the trading price of the TIBCO common stock and the aggregate cash
consideration payable to the Talarian stockholders in the merger would be
reasonably likely to cause the 45% threshold not to be met, or if TIBCO is
otherwise unable to obtain an opinion that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization, after its reasonable best efforts to do so, then TIBCO may
elect to cause the merger instead to be structured as a reverse triangular
merger. Use of the reverse triangular merger structure will avoid the
substantial corporate tax that would otherwise be incurred if the forward
triangular merger structure were used and the merger failed to qualify as a
reorganization.

   If the reverse triangular merger structure is used, Talarian may elect to
cause TIBCO to merge Talarian into another direct wholly owned subsidiary of
TIBCO following the reverse triangular merger. Talarian will elect to cause
TIBCO to undertake this second-step forward triangular merger if the fair
market value of the TIBCO common stock issued to the Talarian stockholders in
the merger, determined as of the completion of the merger, is at least 40% of
the fair market value of all of the merger consideration paid to the Talarian
stockholders. If used, the combined merger structure, the reverse triangular
merger followed by a second-step forward triangular merger, more likely than
not will qualify as a reorganization. However, such qualification is not free
from doubt, because the combined merger structure has not specifically been
determined to so qualify by any court decision or ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service, although the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that an
analogous transaction structure qualifies as a reorganization. Nothing,
however, prevents the Internal Revenue Service from adopting a contrary
position. If TIBCO causes the reverse triangular merger to occur and the
second-step forward triangular merger is not undertaken, then the merger, while
not incurring a corporate level tax, will be fully taxable to the Talarian
stockholders.

   Because the factual circumstances necessary to determine which of the
foregoing structures will be used, particularly the market value of the TIBCO
common stock prior to the closing of the merger, will not be known prior to the
time of the vote of the Talarian stockholders, the United Stated federal income
tax consequences of the merger to you will not be known at that time.

   Forward Triangular Merger Structure.  If the forward triangular merger
structure is used, assuming the accuracy of customary representations and
covenants to be made by TIBCO, Panther Acquisition Corp. and Talarian in
certificates to be delivered to counsel by the respective managements of TIBCO,
Panther Acquisition Corp. and Talarian, the merger will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. In such
event, the following United States federal income tax consequences will result:

   (a) You will recognize gain, but will not be able to claim a loss, upon the
       receipt of TIBCO common stock and cash in the merger in exchange for
       your Talarian common stock to the extent of the lesser of (i) the amount
       of cash you receive in the merger, or (ii) the excess of the sum of the
       cash and the fair market value as of the time the merger is completed of
       the TIBCO common stock you receive in the merger over your adjusted tax
       basis in the Talarian common stock surrendered. Any such gain will
       generally be capital gain, and such capital gain will be long-term
       capital gain if the Talarian common stock was held more than one year as
       of the completion date of the merger. If you own TIBCO common stock,
       actually or constructively within the meaning of certain constructive
       ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code, at the time of the
       merger, special rules may apply that could cause gain recognized by you
       to be taxed as ordinary dividend income rather than capital gain. You
       should consult your own tax advisor with respect to that possibility in
       such circumstances.

   (b) Your aggregate adjusted tax basis in the TIBCO common stock you receive
       in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of your
       Talarian common stock surrendered, increased by the amount of any gain
       recognized including any amount treated as a dividend as mentioned in
       the previous paragraph, and decreased by the amount of any cash received.

   (c) Your holding period for your TIBCO common stock received in the merger
       will include the period during which you held the Talarian common stock
       surrendered in the merger, provided that you held your Talarian common
       stock as a capital asset at the time of the merger.

   (d) If you exercise appraisal rights with respect to all of your Talarian
       common stock, you will generally recognize gain or loss for federal
       income tax purposes, measured by the difference between the amount of
       cash received and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. Such gain or
       loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will qualify as
       long-term capital gain or loss if the Talarian common stock was held for
       more than one year at the time of the merger. However, if you own any
       shares of TIBCO common stock at the time of the merger, either actually
       or constructively within the meaning of certain constructive ownership
       rules under the Internal Revenue Code, you should consult with your own
       tax advisor with respect to the possibility that gain you recognize may
       be taxed as ordinary dividend income rather than capital gain.

   (e) Any cash received by you for a fractional share of TIBCO common stock
       will be treated as though you received such fractional share and then
       TIBCO redeemed it in exchange for such cash. You generally should
       recognize capital gain or loss equal to the excess of the amount of cash
       received for such fractional share over the portion of the adjusted tax
       basis in your Talarian common stock allocable to the fractional share of
       TIBCO common stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital
       gain or loss if you held your Talarian common stock more than a year as
       of the date of completion of the merger.

   (f) None of TIBCO, Talarian or Panther Acquisition Corp. will recognize gain
       or loss solely as a result of the merger.

   Reverse Triangular Merger Structure.  As discussed above, under certain
circumstances, TIBCO may elect to cause the merger to be structured not as a
forward triangular merger but as a reverse triangular merger. In such event,
and assuming Talarian does not cause the second-step forward triangular merger
to occur, the merger will not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Instead, the merger will be a
fully taxable transaction to Talarian stockholders and the following United
States federal income tax consequences will therefore result:

   (a) You will recognize gain or loss, whether you exchange your Talarian
       common stock for merger consideration or exercise appraisal rights,
       equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the cash and the fair
       market value, as of the completion of the merger, of the TIBCO common
       stock you receive, and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the Talarian
       common stock you surrender.

   (b) Your aggregate tax basis in the TIBCO common stock you receive will
       equal its fair market value as of the completion of the merger.

   (c) Your holding period in the TIBCO common stock you receive will commence
       the day after the date of the completion of the merger.

   (d) None of TIBCO, Talarian or Panther Acquisition Corp. will recognize gain
       or loss solely as a result of the merger.

   Reverse Triangular Merger and Second-Step Forward Triangular Merger
Structure.  As discussed above, under certain circumstances, TIBCO may elect to
use the reverse triangular merger structure and Talarian may cause TIBCO to
merge Talarian following such merger into another direct wholly owned
subsidiary of TIBCO, or the Second-Step Sub, in a second-step forward
triangular merger, as described in "The Merger--Structure of the Merger." In
the event that this combined merger structure is used and, assuming the
accuracy of certain customary representations and covenants to be made by
TIBCO, Panther Acquisition Corp., the Second-Step Sub, and Talarian in
certificates to be delivered to counsel by the respective managements of TIBCO,
Panther Acquisition Corp., the Second-Step Sub and Talarian, the combined
reverse triangular merger and second-step forward triangular merger structure
more likely than not will qualify as a reorganization, with the

same federal income tax consequences as the forward triangular merger as
described previously. However, such qualification is not free from doubt,
because the combined merger structure has not specifically been determined to
so qualify by any court decision or ruling of the Internal Revenue Service,
although the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that an analogous transaction
structure qualifies as a reorganization. Nothing, however, prevents the
Internal Revenue Service from asserting that the combined merger structure does
not qualify as a reorganization. If the combined merger structure does not
qualify as a reorganization, the transaction will be fully taxable to Talarian
stockholders in the same manner as the reverse triangular merger as discussed
above.

   The foregoing conclusions regarding the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger if structured as a forward triangular merger, a
reverse triangular merger, or a reverse triangular merger followed by a
second-step forward triangular merger neither bind the Internal Revenue Service
nor preclude it from adopting a contrary position. In addition, the conclusions
regarding the qualification of the merger as a reorganization if structured as
a forward triangular merger or a reverse triangular merger followed by a
second-step forward triangular merger are based on the truth and accuracy of
the representations and covenants set forth in the previously mentioned
management certificates to be provided by TIBCO, Panther Acquisition Corp., and
as applicable, the Second-Step Sub. If these representations and covenants are
materially inaccurate, such conclusions regarding qualification of the merger
as a reorganization could be adversely affected.

   Backup Withholding.  Payments made to you may be subject to information
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and to a 30% backup withholding tax.
Backup withholding will not apply to a payment to you if you properly complete
and sign the substitute Form W-9 which will be included as part of the
transmittal letter, or otherwise prove to TIBCO and Panther Acquisition Corp.
that you are exempt from backup withholding. If you are subject to the 30%
backup withholding, the tax withheld will be credited against your federal
income tax liability.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

   We intend to account for the merger as a purchase transaction for financial
reporting and accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting
principles. After the merger, the results of operations of Talarian will be
included in the consolidated financial statements of TIBCO. The purchase price,
which is equal to the aggregate merger consideration, will be allocated based
on the fair values of the Talarian assets acquired and the Talarian liabilities
assumed. The amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the
net tangible assets of Talarian acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and
other studies that have not yet been finalized.

Appraisal Rights

   Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Talarian stockholders may object
to the merger and demand in writing that Talarian pay the fair value of their
shares. Determination of fair value is based on all relevant factors, but
excludes any appreciation or depreciation resulting from the anticipation or
accomplishment of the merger. Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal
rights must comply with all of the procedures to preserve those rights. A copy
of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth the
appraisal rights, is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus.

   Section 262 sets forth the procedures a stockholder requesting appraisal
must follow. These procedures are complicated and must be followed completely.
Failure to comply with the procedures may cause your appraisal rights to
terminate. The following information is only a summary of the required
procedures and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Section 262.
Please review Section 262 for the complete procedures. Neither TIBCO nor
Talarian will give you any notice other than as described in this proxy
statement/prospectus and as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

   Section 262 generally requires the following:

    .  Written demand for appraisal.  You must deliver a written demand for
       appraisal to Talarian before the vote is taken at the Talarian
       stockholders' meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be
       separate from the proxy. In other words, failure to return the proxy or
       returning the proxy with a notation on it will not alone constitute
       demand for appraisal. Similarly, a vote against the merger will not
       satisfy your obligation to make written demand for appraisal. You should
       read the paragraphs below for more details on making a demand for
       appraisal.

    .  Refrain from voting for the merger proposal.  You must not vote in favor
       of the merger agreement or the merger. If you return a properly executed
       proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger agreement or the merger,
       your right to appraisal will terminate, even if you previously filed a
       written demand for appraisal. You do not have to vote against the merger
       in order to preserve your appraisal rights.

    .  Continuous ownership of Talarian shares.  You must continuously hold
       your shares of Talarian stock from the date you make the demand for
       appraisal through the closing of the merger.

   Written demand.  A written demand for appraisal of Talarian stock is only
effective if it is signed by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns the
shares at the time the demand is made. The demand must be signed as the
stockholder's name appears on its stock certificate(s). If you are a beneficial
owner of Talarian stock but not a stockholder of record, you must have the
stockholder of record for your shares sign a demand for appraisal on your
behalf.

   If you own Talarian stock in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee,
guardian or custodian, you must disclose the fact that you are signing the
demand for appraisal in that capacity.

   If you own Talarian stock with one or more other persons, such as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, all of the owners must sign, or have signed for
them, the demand for appraisal. An authorized agent, which could include one or
more of the owners, may sign the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of
record; however, the agent must expressly disclose who the stockholder of
record is and that he or she is signing the demand as that stockholder's agent.

   If you are a record owner, such as a broker, who holds Talarian stock as a
nominee for others, you may exercise a right of appraisal with respect to the
shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising that right
for other beneficial owners. In such a case, you should specify in the written
demand the number of shares as to which you wish to demand appraisal. If you do
not specify the number of shares, we will assume that your written demand
covers all of the shares of Talarian stock that are in your name.

   If you are a Talarian stockholder, you should address the written demand to
Talarian Corporation, 333 Distel Circle, Los Altos, California 94022,
Attention: Secretary. It is important that Talarian receive all written demands
before the vote concerning the merger is taken. As explained above, this
written demand should be signed by, or on behalf of, the stockholder of record.
The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and
mailing address, the number of shares of stock owned, and that the stockholder
is thereby demanding appraisal of such stockholder's shares.

   Written notice.  Within 10 days after the closing of the merger, Talarian
must give written notice that the merger has become effective to each
stockholder who has fully complied with the conditions of Section 262. Except
as required by law, Talarian will not notify stockholders of any dates by which
appraisal rights must be exercised.

   Petition with the Chancery Court.  Within 120 days after the closing of the
merger, either Talarian or any stockholder who has complied with the conditions
of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of

Chancery. This petition should request that the chancery court determine the
value of the shares of Talarian stock held by all of the stockholders who are
entitled to appraisal rights. If you intend to exercise your rights of
appraisal, you should file a petition in the chancery court. Talarian has no
intentions at this time to file a petition. Because Talarian has no obligation
to file a petition, if you do not file such a petition within 120 days after
the closing, you will lose your rights of appraisal.

   Withdrawal of demand.  If you change your mind and decide you no longer want
an appraisal, you may withdraw your demand for appraisal at any time within 60
days after the closing of the merger. You may also withdraw your demand for
appraisal after 60 days after the closing of the merger, but only with the
written consent of Talarian. If you withdraw your demand for appraisal, you
will receive the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement.

   Request for appraisal rights statement.  If you have complied with the
conditions of Section 262, you will be entitled to receive a statement from
Talarian setting forth the number of shares for which appraisal rights have
been exercised and the number of stockholders who own those shares. In order to
receive this statement, you must send a written request to Talarian within 120
days after the closing of the merger. After the merger, Talarian will have 10
days after receiving a request to mail the statement to the stockholder.

   Chancery Court procedures.  If you properly file a petition for appraisal in
the chancery court and deliver a copy to Talarian, Talarian will then have 20
days to provide the chancery court with a list of the names and addresses of
all stockholders who have demanded appraisal and have not reached an agreement
with Talarian as to the value of their shares. The chancery court will then
send notice to all of the stockholders who have demanded appraisal. If the
chancery court decides it is appropriate, it has the power to conduct a hearing
to determine whether the stockholders have fully complied with Section 262 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether they are entitled to appraisal
under that section. The chancery court may also require you to submit your
stock certificates to the Registry in Chancery so that it can note on the
certificates that an appraisal proceeding is pending. If you do not follow the
chancery court's directions, you may be dismissed from the proceeding.

   Appraisal of shares.  After the chancery court determines which stockholders
are entitled to appraisal rights, the chancery court will appraise the shares
of Talarian common stock. To determine the fair value of the shares, the
chancery court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation
or depreciation resulting from the anticipation or accomplishment of the
merger. After the chancery court determines the fair value of the shares, it
will direct Talarian to pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to
appraisal. The chancery court can also direct Talarian to pay interest, simple
or compound, on that value if the chancery court determines that interest is
appropriate. In order to receive the fair value for your shares, you must
surrender your stock certificates to Talarian.

   The chancery court could determine that the fair value of shares of Talarian
stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. In
other words, if you demand appraisal rights, you could receive less
consideration than you would under the merger agreement.

   United States federal income tax consequences.  The exchange of shares for
cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights will be a taxable transaction
for United States federal income tax purposes and possibly state, local and
foreign income tax purposes as well. See "--Material United States Federal
Income Tax Considerations" on page 54.

   Costs and expenses of appraisal proceeding.  The costs and expenses of the
appraisal proceeding may be assessed against Talarian and the stockholders
participating in the appraisal proceeding, as the chancery court deems
equitable under the circumstances. You can request that the chancery court
determine the amount of interest, if any, that Talarian should pay on the value
of stock owned by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. You may
also request that the chancery court allocate the expenses of the appraisal
action incurred by any stockholder pro rata against the value of all of the
shares entitled to appraisal.

   Loss of stockholder's rights.  If you demand appraisal, after the closing of
the merger you will not be entitled to:

    .  vote your shares of stock, for any purpose, for which you have demanded
       appraisal;

    .  receive payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to
       your shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are
       payable to holders of record as of a record date before the effective
       time of the merger; or

    .  receive the payment of the consideration provided for in the merger
       agreement.

   However, you can regain these rights if no petition for an appraisal is
filed within 120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to
Talarian a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and your
acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the closing of the merger
or with the written consent of Talarian. As explained above, these actions will
also terminate your appraisal rights. However, an appraisal proceeding in the
chancery court cannot be dismissed without the chancery court's approval. The
chancery court may condition its approval upon any terms that it deems just.

   If you fail to comply strictly with these procedures you will lose your
appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights,
we strongly urge you to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise
your appraisal rights.

Delisting and Deregistration of Talarian Common Stock

   If the merger is consummated, the Talarian common stock will be delisted
from The Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act.

Listing of TIBCO Common Stock to be Issued in the Merger

   TIBCO will authorize for listing on The Nasdaq National Market the shares of
TIBCO common stock to be issued, or required to be reserved for issuance, in
connection with the merger.

Restriction on Resales of TIBCO Common Stock

   The TIBCO common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered under
the Securities Act, thereby allowing such shares to be freely transferable
without restriction by all former holders of Talarian common stock who are not
"affiliates" of Talarian at the time of the annual meeting and who do not
become "affiliates" of TIBCO after the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates of TIBCO or Talarian generally include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by or are under common control with, TIBCO or Talarian,
and may include some of their respective officers and directors, as well as
their respective significant stockholders.

   Shares of TIBCO common stock received by those stockholders of Talarian who
are deemed to be affiliates of Talarian or TIBCO may not be sold except
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
covering the resale of those shares, an exemption under Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover the resale of any TIBCO
common stock received by any person who may be deemed to be an affiliate of
TIBCO or Talarian.

                             THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. Stockholders of
Talarian are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety for a more
complete description of the merger. In the event of any discrepancy between the
terms of the merger agreement and the following summary, the merger agreement
will control.

The Merger

   Following the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the
stockholders of Talarian and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions
to the merger set forth in the merger agreement, Talarian and Panther
Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO, will merge and the
surviving corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of TIBCO.

The Effective Time

   As soon as practicable on or after the closing of the merger, the parties
will cause the merger to become effective by filing a certificate of merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State. The parties anticipate that the closing
of the merger will occur in TIBCO's second fiscal quarter of 2002.

Directors and Officers of Talarian After the Merger

   At the effective time, the directors of Panther Acquisition Corp. will
become the new directors of Talarian, and the officers of Panther Acquisition
Corp. will become the new officers of Talarian.

Conversion of Shares of Talarian Common Stock in the Merger

   Upon completion of the merger, each share of Talarian common stock will be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive (a) $2.65 in
cash, without interest, and (b) a fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock
equal to $2.65 divided by the average closing trading price for TIBCO common
stock, as defined below, or the merger exchange ratio. Shares of Talarian
common stock held by Talarian, TIBCO or any wholly owned subsidiary of Talarian
or TIBCO immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be cancelled.
The average closing trading price for TIBCO common stock is equal to the
average of the closing sales prices for one share of TIBCO common stock as
reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the 10 consecutive trading days
ending and including one day prior to the closing of the merger, provided that:

    .  if the average closing price is greater than $16.21, then the average
       closing trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the merger
       consideration will be equal to $16.21;

    .  if the average closing price is less than $12.16, then the average
       closing trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the merger
       consideration will be equal to $12.16; and

    .  if the average closing price is between $12.16 and $16.21, then the
       average closing trading price of TIBCO common stock for calculating the
       merger consideration will be equal to that average closing price.

The number of shares of TIBCO common stock issuable in the merger will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or similar event with
respect to TIBCO common stock or Talarian common stock effected between the
date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.

Talarian's Stock Options and Warrant

   At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding stock option to
purchase shares of Talarian common stock will be assumed by TIBCO regardless of
whether or not they are exercisable. Each Talarian stock option

that is assumed by TIBCO will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, except that each Talarian stock option will be exercisable
for, calculated on a per share of Talarian common stock basis, (a) $2.65 in
cash, without interest, and (b) the merger exchange ratio. Accordingly,

    .  the per share exercise price of any given option will be determined by
       dividing the exercise price of the option immediately prior to the
       effective time by the merger exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest
       whole cent; and

    .  each share of TIBCO common stock issued upon the exercise of an assumed
       option after completion of the merger will be issued together with the
       pro rata portion of cash consideration equal to the total amount of cash
       that would have been issued in the merger if the option being exercised
       had been exercised in full immediately prior to the merger divided by
       the total number of shares of TIBCO common stock that would have been
       issued upon exercise of the assumed option if the assumed option had
       been exercised in full immediately following the effective time of the
       merger.

   TIBCO has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares
of TIBCO common stock issuable with respect to the assumed Talarian stock
options within 20 business days after the effective time of the merger, and
TIBCO intends to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for
so long as any such Talarian stock options or other rights remain outstanding.

   At the effective time, the outstanding warrant to purchase shares of
Talarian common stock will be assumed by TIBCO and will continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the
warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the
warrant will be exercisable for, calculated on a per share of Talarian common
stock basis, (a) $2.65 in cash, without interest, and (b) the merger exchange
ratio. Accordingly,

    .  the per share exercise price of the warrant will be determined by
       dividing the exercise price per share of the warrant immediately prior
       to the effective time by the merger exchange ratio, rounded to the
       nearest whole cent; and

    .  each share of TIBCO common stock issued upon the exercise of the
       outstanding warrant after completion of the merger will be issued with
       the pro rata portion of cash consideration equal to the total amount of
       cash that would have been issued in the merger if the warrant had been
       exercised in full immediately prior to the merger divided by the total
       number of shares of TIBCO common stock that would have been issued upon
       exercise of the warrant if the warrant had been exercised in full
       immediately following the effective time of the merger.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   Talarian has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that permits eligible employees
to purchase Talarian common stock through payroll deductions at a discount to
market value. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Talarian will
cause the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to be amended prior to the closing of
the merger in order to accelerate the purchase date for the 2001 offering
period still then in effect such that the new purchase date will occur on the
earlier of one day prior to the closing or July 31, 2002, to amend the plan to
provide that the offering period which commenced on February 1, 2002 will
terminate on the earlier of the closing or January 31, 2004, and to terminate
the plan prior to the closing. If the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is
terminated on or prior to the closing, each participant will receive a full
refund for all contributions made in the offering period that commenced on
February 1, 2002.

The Exchange Agent

   Promptly after the effective time, TIBCO is required to make available to a
bank or trust company cash and shares of TIBCO common stock to be exchanged for
shares of Talarian common stock, and cash to pay for

fractional shares and any dividends or distributions to which holders of
Talarian common stock may be entitled to receive under the merger agreement.

Procedures for Exchanging Stock Certificates

   Promptly after the effective time, TIBCO will cause the exchange agent to
mail to the holders of record of Talarian stock certificates (a) a letter of
transmittal and (b) instructions on how to surrender Talarian stock
certificates in exchange for cash and TIBCO common stock certificates
representing the merger consideration, cash for fractional shares and cash for
any dividends or other distributions that they may be entitled to receive under
the merger agreement. Holders of Talarian common stock should not surrender
their Talarian stock certificates until they receive the letter of transmittal
from the exchange agent.

   Upon surrendering their Talarian stock certificates, the letter of
transmittal and any other documents required by the exchange agent, the holders
of Talarian stock certificates will be entitled to receive cash, a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of TIBCO common stock which that
holder has the right to receive, cash for fractional shares of TIBCO common
stock and cash for any dividends or other distributions to which the holder is
entitled. Until surrendered to the exchange agent, outstanding Talarian stock
certificates will be deemed from and after the effective time to evidence (a)
only the ownership of the number of full shares of TIBCO common stock into
which their shares of Talarian common stock were converted at the effective
time, (b) the right to receive $2.65 per share and (c) the right to receive an
amount in cash for any fractional shares and any dividends or distributions
payable under the merger agreement.

   No holder of Talarian stock certificates will be entitled to receive any
dividends or other distributions on TIBCO common stock until the merger is
completed and such holder has surrendered their Talarian stock certificates in
exchange for TIBCO stock certificates. TIBCO does not anticipate paying any
dividends with respect to its stock.

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

   Until each Talarian stockholder surrenders his Talarian stock certificate in
exchange for a TIBCO stock certificate, that stockholder will not receive any
dividends or other distributions declared or made by TIBCO after the effective
time of the merger. However, once that stockholder surrenders his or her
Talarian stock certificate to the exchange agent, he or she will receive (a) a
TIBCO stock certificate; (b) cash, without interest, as payment for the cash
merger consideration; (c) cash as payment for fractional shares and (d) cash,
without interest, as payment for any dividends or other distributions declared
or made by TIBCO after the effective time of the merger.

No Fractional Shares

   No fractional shares of TIBCO common stock will be issued because of the
merger or upon the exercise of any Talarian stock option or Talarian warrant.
Instead, each holder of Talarian common stock or other equity security who
would be entitled to a fractional share of TIBCO common stock will receive
cash. The amount of cash to be received by such Talarian stockholder will be
equal to the fraction of such share that stockholder would have received
multiplied by the average closing sale price of one share of TIBCO common stock
as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the 10 consecutive trading days
ending and including one day prior to the effective time of the merger or the
date of exercise, as the case may be.

Representations and Warranties

    .  Talarian's due organization;

    .  Talarian's capital structure;

Conduct of Business of Talarian Pending the Merger

   Talarian has agreed that, from the date of the merger agreement until the
earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the effective time of the
merger, Talarian and its subsidiary will carry on their business in the usual,
regular and ordinary course and pay their debts and taxes when due. Talarian is
required to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practices
and policies to:

    .  preserve intact its present business organization;

    .  keep available the services of its present officers and employees; and

    .  preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors,
       licensees and others with which it has business dealings.

   Talarian has also agreed that, prior to the effective time or the
termination of the merger agreement, Talarian and its subsidiary will not do
any of the following without TIBCO's consent:

    .  waive any stock repurchase rights, accelerate, amend or change the
       period of exercisability of options or restricted stock, reprice options
       granted under any stock plans or authorize cash payments in exchange for
       any options granted under any stock plans;

    .  enter into any joint ventures, strategic partnerships or alliances;

    .  sell, lease, license, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material
       properties or assets;

    .  transfer, license, extend, amend or modify in any material respect any
       rights to Talarian's intellectual property, other than standard end-user
       licenses in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
       practices;

    .  declare, set aside or pay any dividends or make any other distributions
       in respect of any capital stock or split, combine or reclassify any
       capital stock or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities
       in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for any capital stock;

    .  purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock,
       except repurchases of unvested shares at cost in connection with the
       termination of the employment relationship;

    .  incur any indebtedness or guarantee any indebtedness of another person
       or issue or sell any debt securities or options, warrants, calls or
       other rights to acquire any debt securities of Talarian;

    .  adopt or amend any employee benefit plan;

    .  enter into any employment contract or collective bargaining agreement
       other than offer letters and agreements entered into in the ordinary
       course of business with employees who are terminable "at will";

    .  pay any special bonus or special remuneration to any director or
       employee, or increase the salaries or wage rates or fringe benefits,
       including rights to severance or indemnification, of its directors,
       officers, employees or consultants;

    .  modify, amend or terminate any material contract or agreement, including
       any joint venture agreement, or waive, release or assign any material
       rights or claims under any material contract or agreement;

    .  enter into any licensing, distribution, sponsorship, advertising,
       merchant program, encoding services, hosting or other contracts,
       agreements or obligations which may not be canceled without penalty by
       Talarian upon 45 days or less notice or which include over $50,000 in
       payments by or to Talarian over the term of the agreement or which
       include any exclusive terms of any kind;

    .  revalue any of its assets or make any change in accounting methods,
       principles or practices;

    .  fail to make timely filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

    .  renew certain agreements following the expiration of such agreements in
       accordance with their terms;

    .  engage in any action with the intent to adversely impact any of the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or

    .  agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions described in
       the immediately preceding bullet points.

No Solicitation

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Talarian and its subsidiary will not nor will they authorize or permit any of
their respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by them to:

    .  solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of
       any "acquisition proposal", as defined below;

    .  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
       any person any non-public information with respect to, or otherwise
       facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes
       or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal;

    .  engage in discussions with any person with respect to any acquisition
       proposal, except as permitted by the merger agreement;

    .  approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal, subject to the
       fiduciary obligations of Talarian's board of directors; or

    .  enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       acquisition proposal.

   However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Talarian
stockholders, the merger agreement does not prohibit Talarian from furnishing
non-public information regarding Talarian and its subsidiary to, entering into
a confidentiality agreement with or entering into discussions with, any person
or group in response to a "superior offer", as defined below, or any offer or
proposal that the Talarian board of directors reasonably determines in good
faith is likely to lead to a superior offer, if:

    .  neither Talarian nor any representative of Talarian has violated any of
       the restrictions set forth above;

    .  Talarian's board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
       outside legal counsel, that the action is required for the board to
       comply with its fiduciary obligations to Talarian's stockholders;

    .  prior to furnishing any non-public information to, or entering into
       discussions with, any person or group, Talarian (a) gives TIBCO written
       notice of the identity of the person or group and Talarian's intention
       to furnish non-public information to, or enter into discussions with,
       the person or group and (b) Talarian receives from the person or group
       an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations
       on the use and disclosure of all non-public information furnished by
       Talarian; and

    .  contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to any
       person or group, Talarian furnishes the same non-public information to
       TIBCO.

   In addition, Talarian has agreed to:

    .  provide TIBCO with 24-hours prior notice of any meeting of Talarian's
       board of directors at which the board is reasonably expected to consider
       a superior offer;

    .  provide TIBCO with 48-hours prior written notice of a meeting of
       Talarian's board of directors at which the board is expected to consider
       withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in
       favor of the merger together with a copy of the documentation relating
       to a superior offer that exists at that time; and

    .  provide TIBCO with reasonable notice of the material terms of the
       superior offer and reasonable opportunity to make a counter-offer prior
       to any commitment by Talarian with respect to the superior offer.

   The merger agreement defines an "acquisition proposal" as any bona fide
offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
involving:

    .  any acquisition or purchase from Talarian by any person or group owning
       more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
       Talarian or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange
       offer that if consummated would result in any person or group
       beneficially owning 20% or more of the total outstanding voting
       securities of Talarian or any of its subsidiaries;

    .  any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Talarian pursuant to which the stockholders of Talarian
       immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity
       interest in the surviving entity after such transaction;

    .  any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
       exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
       business), acquisition or disposition of more than 20% of the assets of
       Talarian; or

    .  any liquidation or dissolution of Talarian.

   Talarian has agreed to promptly advise TIBCO of any request for non-public
information or other inquiry which Talarian reasonably believes could lead to
an acquisition proposal or of any acquisition proposal, the material terms and
conditions of the acquisition proposal and the identity of the person or group
making the request, inquiry or acquisition proposal. Further, Talarian has
agreed to keep TIBCO informed on a current basis of the status and details of
any request, inquiry or acquisition proposal.

   The merger agreement defines a "superior offer" as an unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to complete any of the following
transactions:

    .  a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Talarian under
       which the stockholders of Talarian immediately preceding the transaction
       hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting
       entity of the transaction;

    .  a sale or other disposition by Talarian of all or substantially all of
       its assets; or

    .  the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Talarian, directly or
       indirectly, of beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the voting power
       of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Talarian, in each
       case on terms that the board of directors of Talarian determines, in its
       reasonable judgment, after consultation with a nationally recognized
       financial advisor, to be more favorable to Talarian stockholders than
       the terms of the

       merger. An offer will not be a superior offer if any financing required
       to complete the transaction is not committed and it is not likely in the
       reasonable judgment of the board of directors of Talarian to be obtained
       on a timely basis.

   Talarian's board may, without breaching the merger agreement, withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger proposal if
Talarian's board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its
recommendation is required for the board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to Talarian's stockholders under applicable law.

   Talarian will continue to be obligated to hold the meeting of Talarian
stockholders to consider and vote upon the merger and the merger agreement even
if the Talarian board has changed its recommendation in favor of the approval
and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement.

Director and Officer Indemnification

   For six years after the effective time of the merger, TIBCO will cause the
surviving corporation to fulfill and honor Talarian's obligations under any
indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that existed at the
effective time of the merger and any indemnification provisions under
Talarian's organizational documents that were in effect on the date of the
merger agreement.

   The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation
following the merger will contain provisions relating to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified directors and
officers as those contained in Talarian's organizational documents that were in
effect on the date of the merger agreement. These indemnification provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for six years after the
effective time of the merger if such modification would adversely affect the
rights of individuals who were directors, officers, employees or agents of
Talarian immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, unless such
modification is required by law.

   For six years after the effective time of the merger, TIBCO will cause the
surviving corporation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in
effect, if available, directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by Talarian's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy, on comparable terms to Talarian's policy that
existed at the effective time of the merger. However, neither TIBCO nor the
surviving corporation will be required to expend more than 125% of the annual
premium currently paid by Talarian for such coverage.

Employee Benefit Plans

   TIBCO and Talarian will work together to agree upon mutually acceptable
employee benefit and compensation arrangements for Talarian employees.

   The obligations of TIBCO and Talarian to effect the merger are subject to
the satisfaction of the following conditions:

       initiated or threatened, in writing, by the Securities and Exchange
       Commission;

    .  no governmental entity enacts, issues, promulgates, enforces or enters

    .  all waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act relating to the
       merger expire or terminate early and all material foreign antitrust

is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, any of which may be
waived by Talarian:

    .  the representations and warranties of TIBCO contained in the merger
       agreement (a) were true and correct as of the date of the merger
       agreement and (b) are true and correct on and as of the closing date of
       the merger as if made on such date, except for:

       .  changes contemplated by the merger agreement; and

       .  representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
          particular date which were true and correct as of the particular date
          or do not constitute a material adverse effect on TIBCO and Panther
          Acquisition Corp. as of such particular date;

      and Talarian receives a certificate to such effect signed on behalf of
      TIBCO by an authorized officer of TIBCO; and

    .  TIBCO has performed or complied with all agreements and covenants
       required by the merger agreement and Talarian receives a certificate to

subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, any of which may be
waived by TIBCO:

       agreement (a) were true and correct as of the date of the merger
       agreement, and (b) are true and correct on and as of the closing date as
       if made on and as of the closing date except for:

       .  changes contemplated by the merger agreement;

       .  representations and warranties that address matters only as of a

    .  Talarian either (a) obtains certain specified third party consents,
       waivers and approvals or (b) secures rights to functionally similar
       alternative third party technology with different vendors on terms which
       will not materially and adversely effect the operating results for
       Talarian as compared to the terms provided in Talarian's existing
       agreement and integrates such alternative third party technology into
       the relevant Talarian products in a manner that would not materially and
       adversely effect Talarian's continuing business operations;

    .  there is no action or proceeding pending or threatened by a governmental
       entity which:

       .  challenges or seeks to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the
          merger;

       .  seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership,
          operation or any portion of the business or assets of Talarian, TIBCO
          or their respective affiliates or subsidiaries;

       .  requires Talarian, TIBCO or their respective affiliates or
          subsidiaries to dispose or hold separate any portion of their
          business or assets as a result of the merger;

       .  seeks to impose limitations on the ability of TIBCO or any of its
          affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership
          of, any shares of Talarian common stock; or

       .  seeks to prohibit TIBCO or any of its affiliates from controlling any
          material portion of the business or operations of Talarian or its

       at least $40 million, less all transaction expenses associated with the
       merger, including legal, accounting, printing, Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
       filing and financial advisor fees. This amount shall be reduced by $2
       million for each full month (pro rated for any portion of a full month)
       between March 31, 2002 and the effective time of the merger.

   The merger agreement defines "material adverse effect" as any change, event,
circumstance or effect that is materially adverse to the business, assets,
capitalization, condition, or results of operations of such entity and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole. However, none of the following will be deemed in
themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute a material adverse
effect, and none of the following will be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a material adverse effect:

    .  in the case of Talarian only, any adverse change, event, circumstance or
       effect arising from or relating to the loss of existing or prospective
       customers or suppliers, except suppliers of intellectual property, of
       Talarian or Talarian employees due to the effect of the public
       announcement or pendency of the merger;

    .  any adverse change, event, circumstance or effect arising from or
       relating to changes in general economic conditions or changes affecting
       the software industry generally; or

    .  any change in the trading price or the trading volume of TIBCO common
       stock or Talarian common stock, as the case may be.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger, whether before or after the requisite approval of the
stockholders of Talarian has been obtained:

    .  by mutual written consent of TIBCO, Panther Acquisition Corp. and
       Talarian;

    .  by either Talarian or TIBCO if the merger is not consummated by June 30,
       2002, except that the right to terminate is not available to any party
       who has failed to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement and
       such failure was the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the merger
       to occur by June 30, 2002;

    .  by either Talarian or TIBCO if a governmental entity (a) issues a
       nonappealable or final order, decree or ruling or takes any other action
       which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the merger
       or (b) fails to issue an order, decree or ruling or take any other
       action which is necessary to fulfill a condition of the merger and the
       denial has become final and nonappealable;

    .  by either Talarian or TIBCO if the required approval of Talarian
       stockholders is not obtained, although the right to terminate the merger
       agreement will not be available to Talarian if the failure to obtain

       stockholder approval was caused by Talarian's action or failure to act,
       and the action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger
       agreement by Talarian;

    .  by TIBCO if any of the following "triggering events," as defined below,
       occurs:

       .  the Talarian board of directors withholds, withdraws, amends or
          modifies in a manner adverse to TIBCO its recommendation in favor of
          the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger;

       .  Talarian fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the
          recommendation of the Talarian board of directors in favor of the
          approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger;

       .  Talarian's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
          favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
          merger within ten days after TIBCO requests in writing that the
          recommendation be reaffirmed;

       .  Talarian's board of directors approves or publicly recommends an
          acquisition proposal;

       .  the commencement of a tender or exchange offer relating to more than
          20% of the outstanding Talarian common stock by a person unaffiliated
          with TIBCO and Talarian's board of directors fails to send or give a
          statement to Talarian's common stockholders recommending the
          rejection of such tender or exchange offer; or

       .  Talarian intentionally breaches its non-solicitation obligations
          under the merger agreement;

    .  by Talarian, upon TIBCO's breach of any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement as set forth in the merger agreement, or if any
       representation or warranty of TIBCO becomes untrue, in either case such
       that TIBCO is unable to satisfy certain conditions to the completion of
       the merger; however, TIBCO is entitled to a 20-day cure period provided
       that such cure will be completed on or prior to June 30, 2002, and that
       Talarian may not terminate the merger agreement if it materially
       breaches the merger agreement; or

    .  by TIBCO, upon Talarian's breach of any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement, or if any
       representation or warranty of Talarian becomes untrue, in either case
       such that Talarian is unable to satisfy certain conditions to the
       completion of the merger; however, Talarian is entitled to a 20-day cure
       period provided that such cure will be completed on or prior to June 30,
       2002, and that TIBCO may not terminate the merger agreement if it
       materially breaches the merger agreement.

Termination Fee and Expenses

   Except as set forth below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the merger agreement and the merger will be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the merger is consummated. However, TIBCO and Talarian
will share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and
accountants' fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the filing of the
required materials under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, the printing and filing of
this proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement filed by TIBCO
on Form S-4 and any amendments or supplements to such documents.

   If TIBCO terminates the merger agreement because a triggering event has
occurred, Talarian will be required to, within one business day after the date
of such termination, pay TIBCO a termination fee of $3,850,000 and an amount
equal to TIBCO's reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the merger up to a maximum of $550,000.

   If either TIBCO or Talarian terminates the merger agreement because the
required Talarian stockholder vote is not obtained or TIBCO terminates the
merger agreement because Talarian's representations and warranties fail to be
true then, within one day after the date of termination Talarian will pay TIBCO
an amount equal to

TIBCO's reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the merger up to a maximum of $550,000. Furthermore, if within six months
following the termination Talarian enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to another "acquisition transaction," as defined below, or publicly
announces its intention to enter into another acquisition transaction with a
third party, and the acquisition transaction is subsequently consummated, then
contemporaneously with consummation Talarian must pay TIBCO the $3,850,000
termination fee.

   An "acquisition transaction" is defined as:

    .  any merger, consolidation, or business combination in which the
       stockholders of Talarian immediately prior to the transaction hold less
       than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving entity;

    .  any sale or other disposition of all or substantially of the assets of
       Talarian; or

    .  the acquisition by a person or group, including a tender offer or an
       exchange offer or issuance of stock by Talarian, of more than 50% of the
       voting power of the outstanding securities of Talarian.

Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement

   Subject to applicable law, the parties may amend the merger agreement at any
time by execution of a written instrument signed on behalf of TIBCO, Panther
Acquisition Corp. and Talarian. In addition, at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger, any party may, to the extent legally allowed:

    .  extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
       acts of the other parties to the merger agreement;

    .  waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to
       such party as contained in the merger agreement or in any document
       delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; and

    .  waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
       benefit of such party as contained in the merger agreement.

               VOTING, NONCOMPETITION AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

Voting Agreement

   Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Paul A. Larson,
Thomas J. Laffey, Mark G. Mahowald, Michael A. Morgan, David E. Gold, Lawrence,
Tyrell, Ortale and Smith, L.P., Nortel Networks, Inc., STF II, L.P. and The
Caplan Family Trust dated August 10, 1999, who collectively owned approximately
    % of the outstanding common stock of Talarian as of the record date,
entered into a voting agreement with TIBCO whereby they agreed to:

    .  appear, or cause their respective holders of record to appear, at any
       meeting, postponement or adjournment of the stockholders of Talarian
       held for the purpose of voting on the merger; and

    .  vote, or cause their respective holders of record to vote, all of the
       shares of Talarian common stock owned, controlled by or subsequently
       acquired by them:

       .  in favor of the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions
          contemplated by the merger agreement; and

       .  against any acquisition proposal or any amendment to Talarian's
          charter documents which amendment, proposal, action or other
          transaction could reasonably be expected to impede or delay the
          consummation of the merger, or change in any manner the voting rights
          of the Talarian common stock.

   In addition, with respect to all shares owned of record and all shares
acquired by the signing stockholders at any time prior to the effective time of
the merger, the signing stockholders have appointed TIBCO as their irrevocable
proxy and lawful attorney to demand that the secretary of Talarian call a
special meeting of the stockholders of Talarian for the purpose of considering
any action related to the merger and to vote each of their shares as their
proxy in favor of the merger.

   The voting agreement prohibits the signing stockholders from selling or
disposing of any shares or options of Talarian common stock owned directly or
indirectly by the signing stockholders, unless the sale or disposition is made
to a person who agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of
the voting agreement.

   The voting agreement also prohibits the signing stockholders from soliciting
additional acquisition proposals from third parties on behalf of Talarian or
from engaging in any discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding
any acquisition proposal.

   The voting agreement, including all provisions discussed above, terminates
upon the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the effective
time of the merger. A form of the voting agreement is attached hereto as Annex
B.

Noncompetition Agreement

   Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to TIBCO's willingness to enter into the merger agreement,
Thomas J. Laffey, a director and chief technical officer and secretary of
Talarian, entered into a noncompetition agreement with TIBCO, which agreement
will be effective upon the closing of the merger. Under the noncompetition
agreement, Mr. Laffey agreed not to enter into, participate in or be connected
with any business that is engaged in the business of messaging and enterprise
application integration software for a period of two years following the
completion of the merger. In addition, Mr. Laffey agreed not to solicit
employees of TIBCO or customers of TIBCO or Talarian to leave or terminate
their relationship with TIBCO or Talarian during the two-year period covered by
the noncompetition agreement.

Employment Agreement

   Effective upon consummation of the merger, Thomas J. Laffey, a director and
chief technical officer and secretary of Talarian, has signed an employment
agreement with TIBCO to serve as a vice president of TIBCO

for a term of 18 months following the closing of the merger. Mr. Laffey's
employment agreement provides that in addition to his annual salary, he will
participate in TIBCO's bonus plan and will receive, subject to the approval of
TIBCO's board of directors, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of TIBCO
common stock with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of
grant that will vest at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of his
employment and thereafter, in equal monthly increments over the next thirty-six
months. In addition, in the event TIBCO terminates Mr. Laffey's employment for
any reason other than for cause, death or disability, or if Mr. Laffey
terminates his employment because of an adverse change in his compensation,
title, duties or location of employment, the employment agreement provides
severance to him including the payment of his annual salary on a monthly basis
for the longer of six months or the remaining term of his employment agreement,
and the acceleration of vesting of all unvested shares of TIBCO common stock
received by Mr. Laffey prior to the closing of the merger.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   On January 4, 2002, TIBCO entered into a merger agreement with Talarian in a
transaction to be accounted for as a purchase. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, each outstanding share of Talarian common stock will be exchanged
for the right to receive $2.65 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a
share of TIBCO common stock. In addition, each outstanding option and warrant
to purchase Talarian common stock will be assumed by TIBCO and converted into
an option or warrant, as applicable, to receive $2.65 in cash per Talarian
share for which such option or warrant was exercisable and to purchase a
fraction of a share of TIBCO common stock. For the purposes of the unaudited
pro forma combined condensed financial statements, the estimated merger
consideration of $110 million includes $51 million in cash and $51 million of
stock to be issued in exchange for the outstanding common stock of Talarian, $2
million in cash and $5 million of stock options and warrant in relation to the
assumption of Talarian stock options and warrant and estimated expenses of the
transaction of $1 million. The estimated merger consideration reflects issuance
of an estimated 3.3 million shares of TIBCO common stock at an average market
price per share of TIBCO common stock of $15.71. The average market price per
share is based on the average closing price for TIBCO common stock for a period
of three trading days before and after the announcement date. The actual number
of TIBCO common shares to be issued will depend on the actual number of
outstanding shares of Talarian common stock at the closing date and on the
price of TIBCO common stock.

   The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative
of the combined financial position or results of operations of future periods
or the results that actually would have been realized had TIBCO and Talarian
been a combined company during the specified periods. The pro forma combined
condensed financial statements are based on the respective historical
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of TIBCO and Talarian.
The historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of TIBCO are
incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document. The historical
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Talarian are included
elsewhere in this document. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based
on management's estimates, a preliminary determination of the purchase price
and a preliminary third-party valuation of the intangible assets acquired. In
addition, TIBCO management is in the process of assessing and formulating its
integration plans. Restructuring charges associated with such integration plans
and additional adjustments that may be required to reflect acquired assets and
liabilities at fair value have not yet been determined and may be material.

   The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
give effect to the proposed merger of TIBCO and Talarian using the purchase
method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments described in the
accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements. These pro forma statements were prepared as if the merger had been
completed as of December 1, 2000 for purposes of the pro forma statements of
operations and as of November 30, 2001 for purposes of the pro forma balance
sheet.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements, including
the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should
be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto of TIBCO, which are incorporated by reference elsewhere
in this document and the historical consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto of Talarian, which are included elsewhere in this document. See

     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet assumes that the
merger took place on November 30, 2001 and combines TIBCO's November 30, 2001
consolidated balance sheet and Talarian's September 30, 2001 consolidated
balance sheet.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations assumes
the merger took place as of December 1, 2000. The pro forma combined condensed
statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2001 combines TIBCO's
and Talarian's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
November 30, 2001 and September 30, 2001, respectively.

2.  PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

   The pro forma information including the allocation of the purchase price is
based on management's estimates, a preliminary determination of the purchase
price and a preliminary valuation of the intangible assets acquired. TIBCO
management is in the process of assessing and formulating its integration
plans. Restructuring charges associated with the integration plans and
additional adjustments that may be required to reflect acquired assets and
liabilities at fair value have not yet been determined and may be material. The
pro forma combined condensed financial statements have not been adjusted to
reflect any cost savings or operating synergies that may be realized as a
result of the merger.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect an
estimated total purchase price of approximately $110 million. The preliminary
fair value of TIBCO common stock to be issued of $15.71 per share was
determined based on the average closing price for TIBCO common stock for a
period of three trading days before and after the announcement date. The
preliminary fair value of the options to be issued on assumption of Talarian
options was determined using the Black-Scholes model using the following
assumptions: expected life of 36 months, risk-free interest rate of 4.20%,
expected volatility of 128% and no expected dividend yield. The preliminary
fair value of the warrant to be issued on assumption of the Talarian warrant
was determined using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions:
expected life of 12 months, risk-free interest rate of 4.20%, expected
volatility of 128% and no expected dividend yield. An estimated $4.2 million of
additional cash consideration is contingent on the vesting of stock options and
stock subject to repurchase and is to be recorded as compensation expense over
the vesting period. As the final exchange ratio will not be determined until
the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in the merger agreement, the final fair value of TIBCO common stock,
options and warrant will not be determined until that date. The estimated total
purchase price is as follows (in thousands):

   Purchase price:
   Cash............................................................ $ 52,600
   Value of TIBCO common stock to be issued........................   51,200
   Fair value of stock options and warrant to be issued............    5,300

      Purchase price............................................... $109,600
                                                                    ========

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
                  CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   The final total purchase price is dependent on the actual number of shares
of common stock and cash to be issued, the actual number of options assumed,
and actual direct merger costs. The final purchase price will be determined
upon completion of the merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, the
total estimated purchase price is allocated to Talarian's net tangible and
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of
completion of the merger. Based upon the estimated purchase price and the
preliminary independent valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation,
which is subject to change based on TIBCO's final analysis, is as follows (in
thousands):

        Net tangible assets acquired.......................... $ 51,807

                                                               $109,600
                                                               ========

   The tangible net assets acquired represent the estimated fair value of the
net tangible assets of Talarian as of September 30, 2001 of $51.8 million
adjusted to eliminate goodwill and intangible assets of $2.2 million arising
from Talarian's acquisitions of GlobalCast and WhiteBarn.

   A preliminary estimate of $7.3 million has been allocated to amortizable
intangible assets with useful lives of three years for Customer base,
Trademarks, Noncompete agreement, Developed technology, and five years for
Royalties.

   The preliminary residual purchase price of $42.1 million has been recorded
as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," goodwill will be carried at cost and tested for impairment
annually and whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred.

3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

   There were no transactions between TIBCO and Talarian during the periods
presented.

   Based on the timing of the closing of the merger, the final purchase price,
finalization of the valuation, and purchase price allocation, finalization of
the integration plans, determination of the fair value of acquired assets and
liabilities and other factors, the pro forma adjustments may differ materially
from those presented in these pro forma combined condensed financial
statements. A change in the value assigned to long-term tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities could result in a reallocation of the purchase price and
a change in the pro forma adjustments. The statement of operations effect of
these changes will depend on the nature and amount of the assets or liabilities
adjusted.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed provision for income taxes may
not represent the amounts that would have resulted had TIBCO and Talarian filed
consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented.

   (a) To record cash portion of the merger consideration.

   (b) To record a deferred tax liability related to identifiable intangible
       assets.

   (c) To record goodwill and intangible assets including $42.1 million in
       goodwill and $7.3 million of non-goodwill intangibles (see table in Note
       2) and eliminate Talarian historical goodwill and intangible assets.

   (d) To record direct merger costs of approximately $1.0 million.

   (e) To eliminate the historical stockholders' equity of Talarian, record the
       preliminary estimate of the fair value of in-process research and
       development, and record the estimated value of TIBCO shares, options and
       warrant to be issued in the merger.

   (f) To record unearned stock-based compensation.

   (g) To adjust Talarian deferred revenue and deferred tax assets to estimated
       fair value.

   (h) To record amortization of deferred stock-based compensation and
       compensation expense resulting from the vesting of stock options and
       restricted stock assumed in the merger.

   (i) To record amortization of acquired intangible assets and eliminate
       amortization of Talarian historical goodwill and intangible assets.

   (j) To record a decrease in interest income attributable to net cash used
       for the merger.

   (k) To reflect an income tax benefit for the net loss incurred by Talarian
       and pro forma adjustments to the combined condensed pro forma statement
       of operations.

4.  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

   Basic and diluted unaudited pro forma earnings per common share is
calculated based on the assumption that TIBCO will issue approximately
3.3 million shares of TIBCO common stock in the merger. Options and warrants
outstanding during 2001 were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share because inclusion of such options and warrants would
have been antidilutive.

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
                 TALARIAN COMMON STOCK AND TIBCO COMMON STOCK

   This section of this proxy statement/prospectus describes the rights of
holders of TIBCO common stock and Talarian common stock. This section does not
include a complete description of all differences among the rights of these
stockholders, nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights
of these stockholders. In addition, the identification of some differences in
the rights of these stockholders as material is not intended to indicate that
other differences that are equally important or that you deem important do not
exist. This summary, therefore, is qualified by reference to the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Talarian's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, and TIBCO's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and any other
documents to which we refer for a more complete understanding of the
differences between being a stockholder of Talarian and being a stockholder of
TIBCO.

   Talarian and TIBCO are both incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of Talarian
common stock and TIBCO common stock arise primarily from differences in their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. Upon the completion of the
merger, holders of Talarian common stock will become holders of TIBCO common
stock and, consequently, their rights will be governed by TIBCO's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws.

Capital Stock

   The authorized capital stock of TIBCO consists of 1,200 million shares of
common stock and 25 million shares of preferred stock, and the authorized
capital stock of Talarian consists of 50 million shares of common stock and 5
million shares of preferred stock. Both the TIBCO and Talarian certificates of
incorporation authorize the respective boards of directors to issue shares of
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the designation, powers,
preferences and rights of the shares of each series of preferred stock and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferred stock.

Special Meeting of Stockholders

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that the board of directors, the chairman of the
board, the president or one or more stockholders owning at least 10% of TIBCO's
issued and outstanding capital stock and entitled to vote thereon may call a
special meeting of the stockholders.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that the board of directors, chairperson of the
board, chief executive officer, president or stockholders owning at least 50%
of Talarian's issued and outstanding capital stock and entitled to vote thereon
may call a special meeting of the stockholders.

Adjournments

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that when a meeting is adjourned to another time or
place, unless the bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, TIBCO may transact
any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than 45 days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will
be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

   The Talarian bylaws provide any meeting of the stockholders may adjourn from
time to time to reconvene at the same or another place, and notice need not be
given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date
is fixed for the adjourned meeting, then a notice of the adjourned meeting will
be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Action by Written Consent of the Stockholders

   The TIBCO stockholders have the right to take action by written consent of
the holders of outstanding shares of TIBCO so long as the action is signed by
holders having the minimum number of shares that would be necessary to approve
the action if the action were taken at a meeting at which all outstanding
shares of common stock were present and voting.

   The Talarian stockholders do not have the right to take action by written
consent.

Notice of Board Nomination and Other Stockholder Business

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that at an annual meeting of stockholders, the only
business that will be conducted will be business that is (a) specified in the
notice of the meeting given by or at the direction of the TIBCO board, (b)
otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the
TIBCO board or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a
stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing
to the secretary of TIBCO. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of TIBCO
not less than 120 calendar days in advance of the date specified in the TIBCO's
proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's
annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no
annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting
has been changed by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of
the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely
must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. A
stockholder's notice to the secretary will set forth each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (a) a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and
the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name
and address, as they appear on TIBCO's books, of the stockholder proposing such
business, (c) the class and number of shares of TIBCO which are beneficially
owned by the stockholder, (d) any material interest of the stockholder in such
business and (e) any other information that is required to be provided by the
stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act in his
or her capacity as a proponent of a stockholder proposal.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the
board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the
stockholders will be made at the annual meeting of the stockholders (a)
pursuant to Talarian's notice of such meeting, (b) by or at the direction of
the Talarian board or (c) by any stockholder of Talarian who was a stockholder
of record at the time of giving of the notice who is entitled to vote at such
meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth below. For
nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting
by a stockholder, the stockholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to
the secretary of Talarian and such other business must otherwise be a proper
matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of Talarian not
later than the close of business on the 75th day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 105th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting, provided, however, that in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such
anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the 105th day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 75th day
prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the 10th day following
the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made
by Talarian. Such stockholder's notice will set forth: (a) as to each person
whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a
director all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is
otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act, including such person's written consent to being named
in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;
(b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial
owner, if any, on

whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the
notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on
Talarian's books, and of such beneficial owner, and the class and number of
shares of Talarian that are owned beneficially and held of record by such
stockholder and such beneficial owner.

Number and Election of Directors

   Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may fix the number
of directors or the process by which to do so in either its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws. In order to be elected as a director, a person must
receive a plurality of the votes of shares present and entitled to vote. When
electing directors in a Delaware corporation, stockholders do not have
cumulative voting rights unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation
so provides.

   Pursuant to both TIBCO's and Talarian's respective bylaws, the size of the
board of directors of each will be determined by resolution of the board of
directors. The size of the TIBCO board is set at 10 members, while the size of
Talarian's board is seven members. If TIBCO has nine or less directors, Reuters
Group PLC has the right to nominate the following individuals to the board of
directors: (a) so long as Reuters Group PLC and its affiliates hold capital
stock representing 40% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities
of TIBCO, three directors, (b) so long as Reuters and its affiliates hold less
than 40% but at least 25% of the issued and outstanding voting securities of
TIBCO, two directors, and (c) so long as Reuters and its affiliate hold less
than 25% but at least 15% of the issued and outstanding voting securities of
TIBCO, one director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the nomination of
any person as a director designated by Reuters, the person will be approved by
the chief executive officer of Reuters and TIBCO. If the total number of
directors is increased above nine, TIBCO will cause the election of additional
directors selected by Reuters so that the adjusted ratio of Reuters-selected
directors to total directors is not less than the ratio set forth above.

   The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation's board of
directors may be divided into various classes with staggered terms of office.
The TIBCO board of directors is not divided into classes, while the board of
directors for Talarian is divided into three classes with staggered three-year
terms.

Removal of Directors

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that any director or the entire board of directors
may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however,
that any director designated by Reuters may be removed from office only for
cause by the vote of stockholders representing not less than a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of TIBCO entitled to vote upon the election of
directors, or upon Reuters' determination that the director should no longer
serve as such, and upon such determination, Reuter and its affiliates will vote
their TIBCO voting stock to remove such director.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that any director or the entire board of
directors of Talarian may be removed, only for cause and only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the shares then entitled to vote
at an election of directors.

Notice of Special Meetings of the Board of Directors

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that a special meeting of the board of directors
for any purpose may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the
president, any vice president, the secretary or any one director. The bylaws
require that notice of the time and place of a special meeting will be
delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class
mail or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that
director's address as it is shown on the records of TIBCO.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that a special meeting of the board of directors
may be called by the chairperson of the board of directors, the president or a
majority of the members of the board of directors then in office and may be
held at any time, date or place. The bylaws provide that notice of the time,
date and place of the special meeting will be given, orally or in writing, by
the persons calling the meeting.

Indemnification

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that TIBCO will, to the maximum extent and in the
manner permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, indemnify each of its
directors and officers against expenses, including attorney's fees, fines,
judgments, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in
connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of TIBCO, serving at the request of TIBCO as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, or a director or officer of a corporation that was a
predecessor corporation of TIBCO or of another enterprise at the request of
such predecessor corporation. TIBCO will advance to any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding all expenses incurred in connection with
such proceeding prior to the final disposition of the proceeding.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that each person who was or is made a party to,
or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person, is or was a director or
officer of Talarian or a predecessor or is or was serving at the request of
Talarian or a predecessor as a director or officer of another corporation, or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, will be indemnified and held harmless
by Talarian to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, against all expenses, liability and loss, including attorneys' fees,
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith,
provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner which the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Talarian,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Talarian will indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with a
proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by
the Talarian board. Talarian will not be required to indemnify a person for
amounts paid in settlement of a proceeding unless Talarian consents in writing
to such settlement. Talarian will pay all expenses incurred by such a director
or officer in defending any such proceeding as such expenses are incurred in
advance of its final disposition.

Limitation on Liability

   Both the TIBCO and the Talarian certificates of incorporation provide that a
director will not be personally liable to the respective corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent that the elimination or limitation of liability is not
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may
later be amended.

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

   Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, an amendment to the certificate
of incorporation of a corporation requires the approval of the corporation's
board of directors and the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding
stock of the corporation entitled to vote.

   The TIBCO bylaws provide that the bylaws of TIBCO may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote, provided that TIBCO may, in its
certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal the
bylaws upon the board of directors and if such power has been so conferred upon
the directors, it will not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit
their power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of TIBCO. The bylaws of TIBCO
also provide that so long as Reuters Group PLC and its affiliates own at least
20% of the outstanding voting securities of TIBCO, the bylaw sections governing
special meetings,

stockholder action by written consent without a meeting, and notice of special
meetings of the board of directors cannot be amended by the board of directors
of TIBCO without the express written consent of Reuters and the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, and that so long as
Reuters and its affiliates own at least 10% of the outstanding voting
securities of TIBCO, the section of the bylaws governing board representation
cannot be amended by the board of directors of TIBCO without the express
written consent of Reuters and the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of TIBCO.

   The Talarian bylaws provide that stockholders of Talarian holding a majority
of Talarian's outstanding voting stock then entitled to vote at an election of
directors have the power to adopt, amend, or repeal Talarian's bylaws. The
board of directors of Talarian also has the power to adopt, amend, or repeal
the bylaws of Talarian.

Effect of the Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute

   TIBCO and Talarian are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended, that prohibits a Delaware corporation from
engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a
period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an
interested stockholder, unless:

    .  prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the
       board of directors of the corporation approved either the business
       combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming
       an interested stockholder,

    .  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
       least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
       the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
       number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
       directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which
       employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
       whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or
       exchange offer, or

    .  on or subsequent to the time the stockholder became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of
       directors of the corporation and authorized by the affirmative vote, at
       an annual or special meeting and not by written consent, of at least
       66 2/3% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, excluding
       shares held by the interested stockholder.

   Section 203 defines business combinations to include:

    .  any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and any interested
       stockholder,

    .  any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the
       assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder,

    .  any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the
       corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested
       stockholder,

    .  any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
       increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series
       of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder, or

    .  the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
       through the corporation.

   In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or
controlled by such entity or person.

Stockholder Rights Agreement

   TIBCO is a party to a stockholder rights agreement with, among others,
Reuters, Cisco Systems, Inc., Mayfield IX, and Mayfield Associates & Fund III,
pursuant to which:

    .  Each of the stockholders agrees that it will use its best efforts to not
       permit the board of directors of TIBCO to approve, not vote or cause to
       be voted its shares to approve, and not to permit TIBCO to act in any
       way upon a, fundamental decision, unless such fundamental decision has
       been first submitted to Reuters and approved in writing by Reuters. A
       fundamental decision is defined to include a decision of TIBCO with
       respect to the participation of TIBCO in any merger, consolidation, or
       share exchange, or any sale, lease, exchange or other dissolution of all
       or any substantial part of the assets of TIBCO, or any acquisition by
       TIBCO, whether by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or otherwise,
       of any business or entity where the consideration to be paid by TIBCO in
       the acquisition is in excess of either 15% of the market capitalization
       of TIBCO or 15% of the total revenues of TIBCO in the last four
       completed fiscal quarters; provided that in each case such amount
       exceeds $75 million.

    .  On any matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders of TIBCO, Reuters
       and its affiliates agree to waive their rights to vote their shares of
       TIBCO capital stock, and these shares will be automatically voted by
       TIBCO for, against or in abstention in the same proportion as all shares
       of TIBCO's capital stock entitled to vote are cast for, against or in
       abstention. The number of shares of capital stock of Reuters and its
       affiliates for which these TIBCO stockholders will not exercise their
       voting rights will be equal, at any given time, to the number of shares
       owned by these stockholders at such time less a number of shares having
       voting power equal to 49% of the total voting power of TIBCO at that
       time.

    .  Each of the stockholders will have S-3 and piggyback registration
       rights, which registration rights will terminate with respect to any
       stockholder who is able to sell all of its registrable securities under
       Rule 144 under the Securities Act during any one three-month period.

    .  Reuters will have information, inspection and audit rights, including
       the right to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of TIBCO with
       its officers and independent accountants and to make any other
       inspections necessary to permit Reuters to review TIBCO's financial
       statements.

   Talarian is party to an amended and restated investors' rights agreement
with certain stockholders and warrant holders of Talarian, pursuant to which
these security holders have registration rights, including demand, S-3 and
piggyback registration rights. The Talarian stockholders, who are party to this
agreement and have a sufficient number of votes to terminate this agreement,
have agreed to terminate this agreement upon the completion of the merger.

                        INFORMATION REGARDING TALARIAN

                             BUSINESS OF TALARIAN

Overview

   Talarian develops and markets infrastructure software that enables
businesses to exchange information reliably and securely in real time, both
internally and with their partners, suppliers and customers. Talarian's
products and services allow software applications to communicate across local
or wide area networks, including private networks and the Internet. Talarian's
flagship product, SmartSockets, facilitates the real-time distribution of
information across virtually any type of network. SmartSockets also enables
real-time, two-way communications between distributed computer networks and
mobile information devices such as hand-held computers. SmartSockets uses both
a publish-subscribe model of communication to deliver information to those
applications that need it automatically as it becomes available, and a queuing
model of communication to store information and deliver it at a later time if
the application cannot currently be reached. Additionally, using Talarian's
SmartSockets Multicast product, SmartSockets can now use multicast protocols to
deliver data from a few senders to large groups of simultaneous recipients.
This capability, termed "adaptive multicast," gives SmartSockets built-in
intelligence in order to use whichever data delivery mechanism is more
efficient based upon the type of data, the intended recipients, and the
sender's and user's network topology.

   Talarian's products use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or
TCP/IP, the standard Internet protocol for one-to-one communication, or
unicast, and reliable multicast protocols for one-to-many communication.
Multicast allows information requested by multiple applications to be sent only
once, rather than as multiple separate messages to each application. As a
result, multicast can provide information simultaneously to multiple
applications and use the existing capacity, or bandwidth, of the network more
efficiently. In addition to the foregoing products, Talarian also provides
connectivity products that facilitate the exchange of information with external
sources, security products that enhance the security of an application, and
monitoring and management tools that monitor system and application parameters
in local or wide area networks. Talarian's products based upon multicast
protocols include SmartPGM, SmartPGM FX, SmartPGM Propagator, SmartSockets for
JMS, and SmartSockets Multicast. Talarian's products provide businesses with a
robust and easy-to-use method of distributing relevant, time-critical
information that continues to operate efficiently, or "scale," with networks as
they grow. Talarian also offers professional services that assist its customers
in systems planning, architecture and design, custom development and systems
integration for the rapid deployment of our products.

   Talarian's products are designed for and implemented in demanding,
mission-critical environments with high volumes of users and data. Talarian's
products have been deployed by over 300 companies in a variety of markets such
as financial services, networking, satellite communications, securities and
energy exchanges, telecommunications and transportation, as well as embedded in
the products of independent software vendors. Talarian's end-user customers
include 3Com, American Stock Exchange, Credit Suisse First Boston, D.E. Shaw,
Lockheed Martin, MCI WorldCom, Raytheon Systems, and SIAC (the New York Stock
Exchange). Talarian has also entered into agreements with Aspect
Telecommunications, BMC Software, Double Click, Micromuse, Nortel Networks, and
Novell that allow them to embed Talarian's infrastructure software in their
product offerings.

Products and Services

   Talarian's messaging technology was originally created more than a decade
ago and has been further developed over the past 10 years. It originally served
as the real-time infrastructure for a number of demanding, high-performance
aerospace applications, including network management, satellite operations,
launch control systems, large-scale integration and test, and other command and
control applications. Almost all of these systems were mission- or
life-critical, requiring the highest levels of performance and reliability.
Today, Talarian's technology is used in a variety of demanding,
high-performance environments, including financial exchanges,
telecommunications, and aerospace applications.

   Talarian's infrastructure software enables organizations to communicate and
deliver mission-critical information reliably across extended computer networks
in real time. Using software "engines," or small, efficient software processes
that can be embedded on computers, Talarian's infrastructure software can be
used to create what is known in the industry as a "virtual cloud," or network
of computers embedded with our software engines. Any application operating
within a virtual cloud is able to deliver information quickly, reliably, and
efficiently to any other application within this cloud. Talarian's software
engines are designed to route and deliver information automatically to any
application within a cloud that has subscribed to this information, even if the
application, or subscriber, requesting the information uses a different
platform or protocol than the application sending the information. In the event
of a system or network failure, Talarian's software engines are designed to
route information dynamically around failures or blocked paths, minimizing
service interruptions or delays. If an application is unable to receive
requested information when it is initially delivered, Talarian's engines are
able to store the requested information and deliver it at a later time.
Furthermore, Talarian's infrastructure software is highly scalable because it
is built upon an architecture and global naming scheme similar to that used by
the internet. Talarian's software automatically partitions workload among the
various engines that are present in a cloud and allows organizations to expand
an existing cloud simply by adding additional engines. In addition, Talarian's
software can be used to connect multiple clouds and form larger clouds,
facilitating reliable, real-time information exchange across local area
networks and wide area networks, including the internet.

   Talarian's products fall into the following categories:

   Data Delivery.  Talarian's data delivery, or messaging, category of
products, form the core of its product lines and provide a variety of message
delivery paradigms, including reliable, real-time, and queued delivery of
information between applications on a network. It enables organizations to
integrate diverse computer applications by connecting each application to a
network through a single interface, instead of directly linking each
application to all other applications. Applications operating within a network
of that type communicate by exchanging messages, or "packets" of data, which
can contain many different forms of information, including audio, video, file,
HTML, XML, database records, text, numbers and structures. Talarian's messaging
technology also supports a wide range of communication models used in
organizations for delivery of messages, including:

    .  Publish-subscribe, where information is automatically delivered to
       applications that have previously expressed an interest in that type of
       information when it becomes available;

    .  Multicast, where information requested by several applications can be
       sent only once, rather than as separate messages to each application,
       reducing the complexity and cost of information distribution within an
       organization;

    .  Queuing, where information is placed in persistent storage until an
       application, or another queue, is ready to accept the information;

    .  Peer-to-peer, where a message is passed directly between two
       applications; and

    .  Request-reply, where information is requested and a result is returned.

   Connectivity.  This category of products is used to connect external sources
of information to Talarian's core products. They include:

    .  Data base adapters, which integrate databases such as those from Oracle,
       IBM, and others;

    .  Web integration, which provides a way to integrate with the world-wide
       web, including critical coexistence capabilities such as HTTP-tunneling
       required to securely pass through corporate firewalls and proxy servers;
       and

    .  Data feed handlers, which integrate financial data feeds with
       SmartSockets.

   Security.  This category covers products that enhance the security of the
overall system via encryption, authentication, and entitlement mechanisms.

   Monitoring and Management.  Talarian's technology can be configured to
monitor system and application parameters in local or wide area networks,
including the internet, using intuitive graphical user interfaces and
SNMP-based implementations. This technology enables users to monitor,
configure, administer, and operate large-scale systems built upon our
infrastructure software and ensure reliable operation.

   Talarian's current products are as follows:

Data Delivery Products

   Talarian currently offers the following data delivery, or messaging
infrastructure, products:

    .  SmartSockets facilitates selective information delivery by enabling
       messages to be delivered automatically only to interested applications,
       also called "subscribers." SmartSockets supports publish-subscribe,
       request-reply, and peer-to-peer messaging. SmartSockets uses both the
       networking protocols of the Internet and reliable multicast to provide
       highly efficient one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
       communications. SmartSockets can operate over virtually any network
       type, including the Internet and wireless networks. This product also
       offers a variety of services that complement the messaging function,
       such as fault tolerance, guaranteed message delivery, data encryption,
       authentication, load balancing, and data translation. SmartSockets
       provides efficient networking and high scalability, and can be embedded
       in the products of independent software vendors as well as an
       organization's existing information system. Talarian also offers the
       following optional add-on modules to SmartSockets that extend its
       functionality:

       .  SmartSockets for JMS is Talarian's implementation of Sun
          Microsystems' JavaMessage Service (JMS) specification. SmartSockets
          for JMS offers real-time, enterprise messaging using an
          industry-standard API. SmartSockets for JMS runs on top of Talarian's
          SmartSockets high performance, real-time messaging infrastructure.

       .  SmartMQ is a message queuing product that provides complementary
          functionality to SmartSockets. SmartMQ enables a system to store
          messages and facilitates backup and audit capabilities. This product
          is designed for use in applications where transactions, in addition
          to being processed in real time, must be available to be processed if
          a system fails, and be subject to verification and audit. SmartMQ is
          tightly integrated with SmartSockets and thus facilitates a seamless
          integration of the queuing and publish-subscribe communication
          models. It can also interoperate with IBM's MQSeries message queuing
          product, allowing companies to leverage their investment in legacy
          systems.

       .  SmartPGM is Talarian's implementation of a real-time, reliable
          multicast protocol known as Pragmatic General Multicast, or PGM, that
          was originally specified by Cisco Systems. A network protocol
          determines how applications communicate with each other across a
          computer network. The performance of a computer network depends in
          part upon the protocols used by the network. Talarian uses TCP/IP,
          the standard internet protocol for one-to-one, or unicast,
          communication in Talarian's

          SmartSockets product family. Talarian also provides reliable
          multicast protocols that enable networks to manage and use existing
          bandwidth more efficiently. SmartPGM reliably and efficiently sends
          data from a few senders to large groups of simultaneous recipients.
          It can be deployed in a wide range of network types, including
          satellite, wireless, and Internet and enterprise networks. SmartPGM
          is an automatically configuring protocol that provides flexibility in
          changing recipient group members. SmartPGM can also support networks
          that aren't PGM enabled through its SmartPGM network elements.
          SmartPGM is designed as a service, or daemon, that communicates using
          a simplified API with applications requiring reliable multicast
          service. SmartPGM is supported by multiple vendors.

       .  SmartSockets Multicast provides more advanced, scalable and efficient
          one-to-many communications via local and wide area networks, internet
          and satellite connections. SmartSockets Multicast integrates PGM APIs
          from Talarian's SmartPGM product. From video and audio conferencing
          to live transmissions of multimedia training courses to stock
          tickers, SmartSockets Multicast enables new applications not possible
          with unicast (i.e. applications that require reliable, scalable and
          efficient one-to-many transmission of rich multimedia content).

       .  SmartPGM FX (formerly SmartTransfer) provides a simple, easy to use
          command line interface and graphical user interface as well as a
          powerful set of utilities to simplify the setup and management of
          file transfers from a single sender to multiple receivers over an IP
          multicast and PGM capable network. It permits the distribution of any
          data files including: HTML, video, audio, graphic and data files to
          multiple sites in a highly efficient manner. SmartTransfer is built
          on top of SmartPGM, and accordingly allows a file to be efficiently
          delivered to a large number of recipients.

   These products also include development functionality that Talarian's
customers use to permit Talarian's products to interface with their software
applications.

   Talarian's data delivery, or messaging infrastructure, products use both
unicast and multicast protocols. Talarian's messaging products can be accessed
through a variety of platforms, programming interfaces such as C, C++, Java and
ActiveX, and operating systems such as Windows, UNIX, Linux, MVS, OpenVMS,
VxWorks and IBM mainframes. This cross platform support allows for
intercommunication among all of these platforms, programming interfaces and
operating systems. For example, the following three processes would be able to
communicate directly: a Java process on Linux, an ActiveX process on Windows
NT, and an MVS process written in C.

Connectivity Products

   Talarian currently offers the following connectivity products:

    .  SmartSockets LiveDB provides a seamless, cost-effective, high
       performance, off-the-shelf database adapter for large distributed
       systems. LiveDB extends the capabilities of SmartSockets and is a
       platform-independent add-on product that enables business-critical
       information stored in multiple enterprise systems and databases to be
       accessed, exchanged and distributed in real-time via SmartSockets
       without rewriting any code, modifying any applications, or learning any
       new APIs.

    .  SmartSockets Gateway (formerly RTgateway) extends the messaging
       functionality of SmartSockets in several key areas. Using SmartSockets
       Gateway, organizations can connect diverse message sources and systems,
       enhance the scalability of their overall messaging infrastructure,
       implement content-based message routing and filtering schemes, and enjoy
       greater message routing flexibility with a choice of publish-subscribe
       or request-reply models.

    .  SmartPGM Propagator for Oracle provides a multicast content transport
       solution for efficient database propagation through an integrated,
       interoperable addition to the Oracle Advanced Queueing (AQ) interface.
       SmartPGM Propagator eliminates redundant point-to-point transmissions,
       decreasing the

       bandwidth used for propagation and the amount of CPU used. SmartPGM
       Propagator for Oracle has been built around Talarian's PGM technology
       and Oracle's advanced queuing technology, and allows Oracle database
       customers requiring efficient and reliable content distribution to
       propagate business-critical information in a more cost-effective manner.

   Talarian currently offers the following security product:

    .  SmartSockets SSL provides private, secure connections between
       SmartSockets processes. Using the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer
       (SSL) protocol, SmartSockets SSL enables the highly secure transfer and
       exchange of information over intranets, extranets and the
       internet--without any reprogramming of existing SmartSockets
       applications.

Monitoring and Management Tools

   Talarian offers the following product to monitor and manage networked
applications utilizing Talarian's data delivery products:

    .  SmartSockets Monitor (formerly RTmonitor) facilitates the monitoring and
       management of applications utilizing SmartSockets. Through an
       easy-to-use graphical interface, SmartSockets Monitor can be configured
       to monitor system and application parameters across both local and wide
       area networks. System events are viewed through a display application
       that can operate anywhere on the network and in multiple locations
       simultaneously without any change in system configuration.

Talarian's online knowledge base.

Professional Services and Training

   Talarian's professional services organization offers a wide range of
consulting services, including systems planning, architecture and design,
custom development and systems integration for the rapid deployment of
Talarian's products. Talarian offers professional services with the initial
deployment of its products, as well as on an ongoing basis to address the
continuing needs of its customers. Talarian's professional services staff is
located in several offices in the United States and an office in London,
England, enabling Talarian to perform installations and respond to customer
demands rapidly across the Americas and Europe. As of December 31, 2001,
Talarian's professional services group consisted of 13 employees. These
individuals have expertise in the e-business, financial services and
telecommunications industries. Many of Talarian's professional service
employees have advanced degrees and/or substantial industry expertise in
network architecture and design, as well as in networking protocols, including
TCP/IP and reliable multicast.

   Talarian provides training for customer personnel at its main office as well
as at customer locations. Talarian also develops custom education programs to
address the specific needs of individual customers and partners.

Acquisitions

   Talarian has made two strategic acquisitions that have augmented its
technology and provided it with additional consulting and development personnel
in the reliable multicast area:

   GlobalCast Communications.  Talarian acquired substantially all of the
assets of GlobalCast Communications, Inc., a Fremont, California-based company,
in September 1999. GlobalCast was a provider of reliable multicast technology,
and prior to Talarian's acquisition of GlobalCast, Talarian had licensed a
significant portion of GlobalCast's technology and had embedded it in
Talarian's SmartSockets product. GlobalCast's primary product was based on
RMTP-II technology. RMTP-II adds reliability and scalability to multicast.
RMTP-II was developed by GlobalCast over a three-year period in conjunction
with Lucent Technologies and academic experts, and was first sold by GlobalCast
in 1998. GlobalCast had licensed some of the core algorithms of RMTP-II from
Lucent, which has a patent on the technology. The license was assigned to
Talarian as a part of the acquisition of GlobalCast and is non-exclusive. While
Talarian draws upon the technology of RMTP-II in our multicast development,
Talarian is currently focusing its multicast protocol development and sales
efforts on the SmartPGM products and is not currently shipping a commercial
version of RMTP-II.

   WhiteBarn.  Talarian acquired WhiteBarn, Inc., a Warrenville, Illinois-based
company, in March 2000. WhiteBarn was a software consulting and development
company focused on reliable multicast and network protocols. The principals of
WhiteBarn had been involved in the design and development of large scale
trading systems and real-time data distribution since 1985. Prior to the
acquisition, WhiteBarn was primarily engaged in consulting activities related
to the implementation of reliable multicast. WhiteBarn had also developed a
commercial implementation of PGM. Talarian maintains WhiteBarn's facility in
Illinois, and 13 WhiteBarn employees joined Talarian in connection with the
acquisition. Talarian is using former WhiteBarn personnel primarily in
consulting and product development activities related to reliable multicast,
and have embedded an enhanced version of WhiteBarn's PGM implementation in
Talarian's SmartSockets product.

Sales and Marketing

   Talarian promotes and licenses its software and sells its services primarily
through a direct sales organization, and also indirectly through system
integrators, foreign distributors, original equipment manufacturers and other
resellers. As of December 31, 2001, Talarian employed 33 sales and marketing
personnel located in several U.S. cities and in the United Kingdom. Talarian
plans to prudently add personnel to its direct and indirect sales staff.

   Talarian's sales strategy targets industries, and organizations within those
industries, that require high-speed, highly scalable messaging infrastructure
for internal use or to integrate efficiently with their customers' and business
partners' applications. Talarian's sales team, which typically includes sales
people, technical sales engineers and professional services personnel, works
together with its customers' personnel to understand the needs and goals of the
customer's particular application and its development and deployment
environments. Customers are allowed to use a full working copy of Talarian's
products on a limited-time basis in order to evaluate Talarian's products in
their environment. The level of customer analysis, both technically and
financially, results in a sales cycle that typically ranges between three and
nine months. For larger opportunities with new customers, these cycles can be
longer.

   Talarian focuses its marketing efforts on programs intended to attract
potential customers and to increase awareness of and promote Talarian and its
products and the benefits they provide. Talarian uses a variety of targeted
marketing vehicles including industry analyst updates and communications,
market data research, print advertising, trade shows and speaking engagements
targeted toward the industries it serves, press relations, electronic customer
newsletters and Talarian's web site. Talarian has developed collateral material
for use by its

direct and indirect sales organizations, including white papers, data sheets,
customer case studies, and press releases and coverage.

Research and Development

   The computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological
change and is highly competitive in regard to timely product innovation.
Accordingly, Talarian believes that its future success depends on Talarian's
ability to enhance current products that meet a wide range of customer needs
and to develop new products rapidly to attract new customers and provide
additional products to existing customers. In particular, Talarian believes it
must continue to respond quickly to users' needs for high-speed, scalable,
easy-to-implement infrastructure software to meet the increasing demands of
applications being deployed in business-to-business e-commerce systems.

   Talarian addresses the needs of current users through regularly scheduled
maintenance and enhancement releases. Talarian's product development
organization is focused on enhancing the scalability, performance and
ease-of-use of its products. The majority of the work performed by Talarian's
research and development organization consists of adding new functionality and
enhanced performance capabilities to its existing product line.

   In addition to Talarian's internal proprietary research and development,
from time to time Talarian licenses technologies from third parties to embed
into its technology. Additionally, Talarian is an active participant in the
IETF standards initiative for reliable Internet Protocol multicast. Talarian is
also a contributing member of the International Middleware Association, Object
Management Group, Securities Industry Middleware Council, Internet Protocol
Multicast Initiative, and Business Quality Messaging Forum.

   Talarian has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in
research and development. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million,
$5.7 million, and $3.2 million in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, and $2.2 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, Talarian
had 38 employees divided into five groups: client, server, security and other
service, quality assurance and documentation. Talarian plans to maintain its
investment in research and development for the foreseeable future. All of
Talarian's software development costs have been expensed as incurred. While
Talarian has licensed externally developed technology for integration into its
products, most of Talarian's products and enhancements to those products have
been developed internally. Additionally, Talarian has in the past augmented its
research and development efforts through the acquisitions of GlobalCast and
WhiteBarn.

Competition

   The market for Talarian's products is intensely competitive, relatively new,
rapidly evolving, and subject to rapid technological change. Talarian believes
that competition will become more intense in the future and may cause price
reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any one of which
could significantly reduce its future revenue. Current and potential
competitors of Talarian include:

   .   enterprise application integration vendors such as Sybase (NEON), Level
       8, IONA, Mercator, TIBCO, webMethods, seeBeyond and Vitria Technology;

   .   infrastructure software and application server providers such as IBM,
       Microsoft, Oracle, Sun and BEA;

   .   vendors of widely used operating system software, including Microsoft
       and Sun Microsystems, may integrate real-time integration functionality
       into future versions of their operating system software or introduce
       directly competing integration functionality; and

   .   information technology departments of potential customers, which have
       developed or may develop systems that provide some or all of the
       functionality of Talarian's SmartSockets software and related products.

   Talarian believes that customers in its industry make purchasing decisions
primarily based on their perception of product performance, perception of the
vendor and product price. Talarian believes, based on discussions with
customers and potential customers, and the results of testing, that the
performance of Talarian's product is a significant competitive advantage for
Talarian. However, some of Talarian's competitors' products offer some
features, such as a greater number of "adaptors" that facilitate connecting
their products with third-party applications, and "business logic" that
facilitates the routing and delivery of information in a manner different than
is used by Talarian's products, that provides them with an advantage with some
customers. Talarian also believes that perception of the vendor is currently
often a significant advantage for its competitors, as they are generally larger
with substantially more resources and name recognition.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

   Talarian's success is highly dependent upon its proprietary software
technology, its trademarks, and brand names, and the goodwill associated them.
Talarian relies primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and
trade secret laws, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements with
employees and third parties, and other similar measures to protect its
proprietary information and intellectual property. Talarian has registered
"Talarian" and "SmartSockets" as its trademarks in the United States, and has
applied to register "SmartSockets" in the European Community, Canada, and
Japan. Talarian acquired the registered trademark "Propagator" through its
acquisition of GlobalCast. Talarian has applied to register the Talarian logo
in the United Sates, and has applied to register "Talarian" and the Talarian
logo in the European Community, Canada, and Japan. Talarian claims as common
law trademarks the terms "GlobalCast," "WhiteBarn," "the world works in real
time," "exchange instantly, distribute globally," the Talarian logo, and
Talarian's product names "SmartPGM," "SmartPGM FX," "SmartSockets MQ,"
"SmartSockets Monitor," "SmartSockets Gateway," "SmartSockets for JMS,"
"SmartSockets SSL," "SmartSockets LiveDB," "MQadmin," "RTserver," "RTdaq,"
"RThci," "RTplayback," "RTie," and "RTarchive." As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Talarian does not own any issued patents, although
Talarian has four patent applications pending before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office involving message transfer. Talarian cannot predict when or
whether it will receive any patents with respect to any of these applications.

   Talarian enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees,
consultants, distributors, partners and customers, and limits access to its
software, documentation and other proprietary information. Additionally each
customer, partner and/or distributor enters into a license agreement, in the
form of a signed license agreement or a shrink-wrap form of agreement embedded
within Talarian's software, with respect to Talarian's software, documentation
and other intellectual property. A small number of Talarian's license
agreements contain provisions allowing access to Talarian's source code under
limited circumstances. Despite Talarian's efforts to protect its intellectual
property, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy or obtain the use of
Talarian's technology. The unauthorized reproduction or misappropriation of
Talarian's intellectual property could allow third parties to benefit from
Talarian's technology without remuneration to Talarian. In addition, as
Talarian intends to expand its operations internationally, effective copyright
and trade secret protection may not be available, or may be limited, in some
foreign countries. If Talarian fails to protect its intellectual property and
other proprietary rights, Talarian's business could be adversely affected.

   Talarian does not believe that its products, trademarks, or other
proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. However,
from time to time, Talarian receives notices from third parties asserting that
it has infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights. In
addition, Talarian may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for
infringement of its proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its
proprietary rights. Any claims of these types could be time-consuming, result
in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays, or lead Talarian to enter
into royalty or licensing agreements rather than disputing the merits of these
claims. As the number of software products in the industry increases and the
functionality of these products further overlaps, Talarian believes that
software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any
claims of these types, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and
expensive to defend. An adverse outcome in litigation or similar proceedings
could subject Talarian to significant liabilities to third

parties, require expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing
technology, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, or require
Talarian to cease the marketing or use of the infringing products, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on Talarian's business, operating results
and financial condition.

   In 1989, Talarian licensed technology from Lockheed that serves as the basis
for many of Talarian's products. This license is fully paid and irrevocable.

Employees

   As of December 31, 2001, Talarian employed 110 people in Los Altos,
California, in several cities across the United States, and in London, England.
Of these employees:

    .  38 were engaged in research and development;

    .  33 in sales and marketing;

    .  20 in professional services and technical support; and

    .  19 in finance and other administrative departments.

   Seven of our employees are located in London, England.

   None of Talarian's employees is subject to any collective bargaining
agreements. Talarian believes its employee relations are good.

Properties

   Talarian leases approximately 16,000 square feet and 13,000 square feet in
two office buildings located in Los Altos, California under two separate lease
agreements that expire in May 2005 and December 2005, respectively. Talarian
leases a total of approximately 13,000 square feet in a single office building
in Warrenville, Illinois under a lease that expires in December 2005. Talarian
also leases office space in London, England and in various cities in the United
States and internationally to support its sales and marketing personnel
worldwide. These facilities are generally leased on a month-to-month basis or
have terms that end in 12 months or less. As of December 31, 2001, Talarian's
corporate facilities in California exceed its current and projected needs and
Talarian recognized a loss of $1.3 million representing the unused portion of
its future lease commitments as of September 30, 2001. Talarian believes that
these facilities are adequate for its current needs and that suitable
additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially
reasonable terms as needed.

Legal Proceedings

   On January 8, 2002, an action, Robert Mathiason v. Talarian Corporation, et
al. was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County
of Santa Clara. In this action, the plaintiff named as defendants Talarian and
the directors of Talarian. The complaint purports to assert claims on behalf of
all public stockholders of Talarian who are similarly situated with the
plaintiff. The complaint generally alleges that Talarian and the directors of
Talarian have breached their fiduciary duties to Talarian's stockholders in
approving the merger, that the directors engaged in self-dealing in connection
with their approval of the merger and that, in approving the merger, the
directors failed to take steps to maximize the value of Talarian to its
stockholders. The complaint seeks class certification and certain forms of
equitable relief, including enjoining the consummation of the merger. Talarian
believes that the allegations are without merit and intends to defend against
the complaint vigorously. Talarian, however, cannot provide any assurance that
Talarian or the other defendants will be successful.

   On August 10, 2001 a stockholder class action complaint was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against
Talarian, certain of its officers and directors, and three underwriters of its

initial public offering. The complaint was brought on behalf of purchasers of
Talarian's common stock between July 20, 2000 and December 6, 2000. The
complaint has been brought as a purported stockholder class action under
Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Talarian and the
individual defendants named in the complaint violated the federal securities
laws by issuing and selling Talarian's common stock in its initial public
offering without disclosing to investors that certain of the underwriters in
the offering allegedly solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors. Talarian is also aware that a similar
lawsuit has been filed on September 25, 2001 in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York against it. Similar complaints have
been filed against a number of other companies that had initial public
offerings in 1999 and 2000. Talarian has not yet responded to these lawsuits,
and no discovery has been conducted. Talarian believes that the allegations in
these actions are without merit, and Talarian intends to defend against these
actions vigorously, but cannot give any assurance that these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on Talarian's business, financial condition,
operating results or cash flow.

   In addition, from time to time, Talarian may be involved in litigation
relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of
business. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, except as
described herein, Talarian is not engaged in any legal proceedings that are
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect
on Talarian's business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
           FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF TALARIAN

   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Talarian's
consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial
information appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Talarian's actual results may differ from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but
not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Overview

   Talarian develops and markets infrastructure software products that allow
its customers to distribute and share information in real time within and
across organizations. Talarian's products enable distributed computer
applications to communicate quickly, reliably and securely across virtually any
type of network, including the Internet.

   Talarian was incorporated in November 1988. From inception through 1996,
Talarian derived a substantial portion of its revenue from a suite of software
products used primarily in connection with mission-critical command and control
operations in industries such as aerospace. In 1997, leveraging Talarian's
technology developed for mission-critical command and control operations,
Talarian refocused is business strategy to provide infrastructure software for
applications relying heavily upon the use of real-time, distributed systems.
Talarian's operating activities during 1997 and 1998 related primarily to
developing its SmartSockets messaging infrastructure product line and directing
its sales and marketing efforts to increase market awareness of Talarian's
SmartSockets product in industries such as finance, telecommunications and
computer hardware and services. In 1999, Talarian launched SmartMQ, a message
queuing product that provides complementary storage, backup and audit
capabilities to SmartSockets. Talarian also added Internet-related applications
and industries, such as business-to-business e-commerce, to its sales and
marketing focus and began a concerted effort to market its product to
third-party partners such as original equipment manufacturers and value-added
resellers. Additionally in 1999, Talarian began incorporating reliable
multicast capabilities into its SmartSockets product line.

   As part of Talarian's overall multicast initiative, it acquired
substantially all of the assets of GlobalCast Communications, Inc. in September
1999, and acquired WhiteBarn, Inc. in March 2000. Later in 2000, Talarian
launched its SmartPGM IP multicast product suite based on its implementation of
reliable multicast protocol known as Pragmatic General Multicast, or PGM, that
was originally specified by Cisco Systems. Talarian's multicast product suite
launched in 2000 included SmartPGM and SmartPGM FX, which simplifies the setup
and management of file transfers from a single sender to multiple receivers
over an IP multicast and PGM-capable network. In 2000, Talarian also launched
two products as add-on products to SmartSockets, SmartSocket SSL, which
provides private, secure connections between SmartSockets processes, and
SmartSockets Gateway, which extends the message functionality of SmartSockets.

   In 2001, Talarian introduced two new SmartSockets add-on products,
SmartSockets Multicast and SmartSockets LiveDB, and extended its SmartPGM
product line with SmartPGM Propagator for Oracle. Additionally in 2001, in part
as a response to overall adverse economic conditions, Talarian made a concerted
effort to optimize its organizational structure and applied more aggressive
cost containment programs. As a result, Talarian closed remote offices in areas
that were not providing adequate returns on its investments. Additionally,
Talarian began to focus its sales, marketing, and engineering resources
primarily on the finance and aerospace industries, which Talarian believed had
the potential for the greatest, and most immediate, returns. Talarian also
continued its efforts toward third-party partners such as original equipment
manufacturers and value-added resellers, primarily in the computer hardware and
software services markets.

   Talarian's critical accounting policy relates to revenue recognition, and is
described below. Other significant accounting policies used to prepare the
financial statements are discussed in Note 2 to Talarian's consolidated
financial statements.

   In addition, significant management judgment was necessary as part of
Talarian's analysis and assessment of whether Talarian's long-lived assets had
suffered impairment. Also, Talarian's determination of the accrual needed to
reflect the cost of operating leases on facilities which are considered excess
to the requirements of Talarian, required significant judgments and estimates.
The basis for the charges Talarian has recorded in the consolidated financial
statements relating to these items is also described below.

   Talarian's revenue consists principally of license fees generated from its
SmartSockets product line and, to a lesser extent, revenue from maintenance,
support, and professional services related to its SmartSockets and SmartPGM
product lines. Talarian licenses its products to end users to deploy in their
networks and, to a lesser extent, to software applications providers to embed
in their products. For end users, Talarian typically ships products with a
shrink-wrap license agreement and recognizes revenue from software license fees
upon delivery of the software to the customer, provided that the fees are fixed
and determinable and that collection is probable. For software application
providers and increasingly with Talarian's end-users, Talarian enters into
signed license agreements. All of Talarian's original equipment manufacturer
and value-added reseller customers enter into signed agreements with Talarian.
For customers using a signed license agreement, revenue is recognized after all
conditions above have been met and Talarian has received the signed agreement.
Talarian recognizes software license revenue ratably over the term of the
license if the license requires Talarian to deliver unspecified additional
software products during its term.

   Maintenance and support revenue consists of fees for providing software
updates and technical support for software products. Talarian recognizes
revenue from maintenance and support fees ratably over the period of the
maintenance and support agreement, typically twelve months. Payments for
maintenance and support are typically paid in advance and are nonrefundable.

   Professional services revenue consists of fees for services, including
product and application development, implementation and installation of
software products, integration of software, on-site support, consulting and
training. Talarian generally recognizes revenue from professional services as
the services are performed.

   Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred
revenue. As of December 31, 2001, Talarian had $5.1 million of deferred
revenue. Of this amount, $760,000 was classified as long-term deferred revenue,
relating primarily to software licenses that require Talarian to deliver
software over an extended period and, to a lesser extent, to maintenance and
support agreements that have a term in excess of one year.

   Talarian markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and,
to a lesser extent, through indirect channels. Talarian also derives revenue
from indirect channel relationships with distributors, original equipment
manufacturers, value-added resellers and systems integrators. Talarian's
third-party relationships have typically been with companies that embed its
product within their product, for which Talarian receives a license fee and, in
some cases, future royalties based on its reseller's product revenue. Talarian
expanded its international presence by opening a sales and support office in
London, England in 1998, and added sales offices in Tokyo, Japan and Frankfurt,
Germany in 2000. Due to the overall economic slowdown that began in 2001,
Talarian has focused its direct international efforts solely in its London
offices, augmented through international distributors. Talarian plans to
prudently increase its current sales force, focusing its efforts on industry
verticals and geographies that provide Talarian the highest return on
investment, and continue current campaigns for the market awareness of the
company and its products. As a result, Talarian expects to incur only moderate
increases in expenditures related to programs designed to achieve those goals.

   In September 1999, Talarian acquired substantially all of the assets of
GlobalCast, a provider of reliable multicast technology, for Talarian common
stock with an aggregate value of $3.6 million. The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 16, and $300,000 of the purchase price was
allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of
the acquisition. Also, in connection with the GlobalCast acquisition, Talarian
recorded intangible assets of $2.9 million. During the quarter ended June 30,
2001, Talarian recorded a charge of $1.2 million,

representing the balance of the GlobalCast intangible assets, to reflect the
impairment of intangibles and other assets, primarily related to Talarian's
goodwill associated with its acquisition of GlobalCast.

   In March 2000, Talarian acquired WhiteBarn, a professional services and
software development company focused on reliable multicast and network
protocols with cash, stock and options to purchase Talarian common stock that
had an aggregate value of $4.9 million. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase. In this acquisition, the acquired technology included existing
technology, but not in-process research and development. In connection with the
WhiteBarn acquisition, Talarian recorded intangible assets of $4.4 million and
is amortizing them over a two to three year period.

   During the year ended September 30, 2001, Talarian recorded $2.2 million of
excess facilities costs, comprising $900,000 of lease payments related to
unused facilities and $1.3 million of estimated sublease losses. A further
reduction in Talarian's facilities requirements relative to its commitments
could result in additional facility cost accruals being recorded in the future.

   Talarian has incurred significant losses recently as it has spent
substantial amounts to develop and enhance its products and has invested
heavily in its sales and marketing organizations. Recent economic conditions
have also served to slow customers' spending decisions. Talarian believes its
success is dependent upon Talarian's ability to continue to expand its customer
base and enhance its technology.

   In connection with the granting of stock options to Talarian's employees
through July 20, 2000, Talarian recorded deferred stock compensation totaling
approximately $22.6 million. This amount represents the difference between the
exercise price and the deemed fair value of Talarian's common stock for
accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted. This amount
is included as a component of stockholders' equity and is being amortized on an
accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the
options consistent with the method described in Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 28. The stock options, or restricted stock purchased
pursuant to these options, generally vest at a rate of 12.5% upon the six-month
anniversary of the option grant date and 2.083% each month thereafter for the
next 42 months. Amortization of the December 31, 2001 balance of deferred stock
compensation will result in charges to operations of $1.62 million, $886,000,
and $72,000 for the fiscal years 2002, 2003 and for the nine months ended June
30, 2004, respectively.

   Talarian has recorded a $50,000 provision for state and foreign franchise
taxes for the period ending September 30, 2001. Talarian has not recorded a
provision for federal income taxes for any period since its inception as it has
incurred losses in each period. As of September 30, 2001, Talarian had net
operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$21.1 million and for California income tax purposes of approximately $1.6
million, available to offset income in future years. The federal net operating
loss carryforwards expire from 2007 through 2021. The California net operating
loss carryforwards expire from 2001 through 2006.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended December
31, 2000

  Revenue

   Total revenue increased by $1.2 million, or 36%, to $4.6 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2001, from $3.4 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2000. Licenses and associated maintenance revenue
represented 94% and 84% of total revenue for the three months ended December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in total revenue for the three
month period was due equally to increases in software licenses and associated
maintenance revenue, offset in part by a decrease in professional services
revenue. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2001, Talarian saw a
significant decrease in the overall demand for Talarian's products and services
that resulted in lower than anticipated license revenue and greater than
anticipated net loss. Talarian believes that this decrease in demand was
primarily due to general and industry

economic conditions. The revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 was
affected by this decrease in demand. While Talarian continues to be adversely
impacted by the decline in overall economic conditions, Talarian's focus on the
financial services and aerospace industries and the resulting increase in
revenue from those sectors, has helped mitigate the impact of such conditions
relative to the year-ago period. One customer accounted for more than 10% of
Talarian's total revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2001. No
customers accounted for more than 10% of Talarian's total revenue in the three
months ended December 31, 2000. International revenue decreased by $63,000, or
10%, to $552,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2001, from $615,000 in
the three months ended December 31, 2000. International revenue was 12% and 18%
of Talarian's total revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

   Licenses.  License revenue increased by $738,000, or 37%, to $2.8 million in
the three months ended December 31, 2001, from $2.0 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2000. The increase in license revenue was equally due to an
increase in the number of SmartSockets software licenses and new product
software licenses that were not offered in the year ago quarter such as
SmartCache and SmartSockets JMS. As a percentage of total revenue, license
revenue represented 59% in each of the three months ended December 31, 2001 and
2000.

   Maintenance.  Maintenance revenue increased by $760,000, or 91%, to $1.6
million in the three months ended December 31, 2001, from $839,000 for the
three months ended December 31, 2000. Approximately $701,000 of the increase in
maintenance is due to customers whose maintenance periods had previously
expired and had re-initiated their maintenance programs and agreed to pay for
lapsed maintenance during the quarter. The increase in maintenance revenue was
due in part to an aggressive campaign to re-initiate maintenance programs for
Talarian's customers for whose maintenance had expired. The balance of the
increase in maintenance revenue was due to larger installed base of customers
receiving ongoing maintenance. Talarian believes that the majority of
Talarian's customers requiring maintenance are now on a current maintenance
program and thus future maintenance revenue will reflect ongoing maintenance
renewals that are recognized over their maintenance period, typically one year.
Accordingly, Talarian expects maintenance revenue to be $1.0 million to $1.2
million for the quarter ending March 31, 2002. As a percentage of total
revenue, maintenance revenue represented 35% and 25% in the three months ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   Professional services.  Professional services revenue decreased by $267,000,
or 48%, to $289,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2001, from $556,000
in the three months ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in professional
services revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2001 was primarily
a result of services delivered during the quarter under a fixed price contract
that requires customer acceptance, which is expected next quarter. As a result,
revenue associated with such services has been deferred until final acceptance
is received from the customer. In addition, the decline in professional
services revenue reflected both a stronger focus on higher margin software
sales and the continuing effects of the previously announced reallocation of
much of the professional services staff to internal product development and to
pre-sales support activities. As a percentage of total revenue, professional
services revenue represented 6% and 16% in the three months ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

  Cost of revenue

   In the three months ended December 31, 2001, cost of revenue decreased by
$139,000, or 15%, to $773,000, from $912,000 in the three months ended December
31, 2000. The decrease in cost of revenue for the three months ended December
31, 2001, was primarily a result of a $178,000 decrease in amortization of
deferred stock compensation associated with terminated employees, offset in
part by an increase in cost of licenses and maintenance revenue commensurate
with the increase in revenue from those elements. As a percentage of total
revenue, cost of revenue represented 16% and 27% in the three months ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Not including amortization of
deferred stock compensation, as a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue
was 14% and 18% in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

   Licenses.  Cost of license revenue includes royalties due for technology
licensed from third parties, product packaging, manuals and documentation, and
software media. In the three months ended December 31, 2001, cost of license
revenue increased by $59,000, or 328%, to $77,000 from $18,000 in the three
months ended December 31, 2000. The increase in cost of license revenue was
attributable to an increase in overall license revenue, particularly license
revenue from royalty-bearing products. Talarian anticipates the cost of license
revenue to fluctuate in absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of total
license revenue as the related license revenue, and the mix of license revenue
among various products, fluctuates. As a percentage of license revenue, cost of
license revenue represented 3% and 1% in the three months ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

   Maintenance.  Cost of maintenance revenue consists of compensation and
related expenses for Talarian's technical support organization. Cost of
maintenance revenue decreased by $28,000, or 8%, to $342,000 in the three
months ended December 31, 2001, from $370,000 in the three months ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenue was due to cost
containment efforts implemented during the second half of the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001. As a percentage of maintenance revenue, cost of maintenance
revenue represented 21% and 44% in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The decrease in percentage is due to the one-time increase
in maintenance revenue of $701,000 for customers that caught up on lapsed
maintenance.

   Professional services.  Cost of professional services revenue consists of
compensation and related overhead expense for personnel and third-party
contractors Talarian uses in performing consulting, implementation and training
services for Talarian's customers. Cost of professional services revenue
increased by $8,000, or 3%, to $244,000 in the three months ended December 31,
2001, from $236,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2000. The increase
in cost of professional services revenue for the three months ended December
31, 2001 was a result of an increase in professional services management,
personnel and supporting infrastructure. As a percentage of professional
services revenue, cost of professional services revenue represented 84% and 42%
in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
increase in the cost of professional services revenue as a percentage of
professional services revenue was a result of increasing the management,
personnel and other supporting infrastructure associated with delivering
Talarian's professional services.

   Amortization of deferred stock compensation.  Amortization of deferred stock
compensation in cost of revenue decreased by $178,000, to $110,000 in the three
months ended December 31, 2001 from $288,000 in the three months ended December
31, 2000 due to cancelled options of terminated employees.

  Operating expenses

   Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include costs of sales
and marketing personnel and related overhead, commissions, field office
expenses, advertising and promotion expenses, travel and entertainment expenses
and other selling and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased
by $734,000, or 21%, to $2.7 million in the three months ended December 31,
2001, from $3.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000. The
decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to the continued application
of cost containment efforts originally implemented during the second half of
Talarian's fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, including a reduction in
marketing programs and overall headcount associated with sales and marketing.
As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses represented 59%
and 101% in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   Research and development.  Research and development expenses consist of
costs of research and development personnel and associated overhead, and costs
of short-term independent contractors required in connection with development
of new products, enhancements to existing products, technical documentation,
and quality assurance. Costs incurred, under Talarian's current engineering
processes, the establishment of technological feasibility and general release
substantially coincide. As a result, no software development costs

have been capitalized to date. Research and development expenses decreased by
$570,000, or 20%, to $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2001,
from $2.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in
research and development expenses was due to the continued application of cost
containment efforts originally implemented during the second half of Talarian's
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, including a reduction in overall
headcount. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses
represented 48% and 82% in the three months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

   General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses include
personnel costs for finance, administration, information systems and general
management, as well as professional fees, legal expenses, bad debt expense and
other general corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased
by $46,000, or 5%, to $925,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2001,
from $971,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is due
to the continued application of cost containment efforts originally implemented
during the second half of Talarian's fiscal year ended September 30, 2001,
including a reduction in overall headcount associated with general and
administrative functions. As a percentage of total revenue, general and
administrative expenses represented 20% and 28% in the three months ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   Amortization of deferred stock compensation.  During the three months ended
December 31, 2001, Talarian recorded $675,000 of amortization of deferred stock
compensation in operating expenses, representing $131,000 of additional sales
and marketing expenses, $334,000 of additional research and development
expenses and $210,000 of additional general and administrative expenses. During
the three months ended December 31, 2000, Talarian recorded $2.0 million of
amortization of deferred stock compensation.

   Direct costs relating to acquisition.  During the three months ended
December 31, 2001, Talarian recorded $480,000 of legal and professional fees
related to the pending acquisition by TIBCO Software.

   Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets.  Amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets was $379,000 and $608,000 in the three months ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount represents the
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in connection
with Talarian's acquisition of WhiteBarn in March 2000.

  Interest income and other, net

   Interest income and other, net consists of interest income, net of interest
expense, income taxes and losses on foreign currency transactions. Interest
income and other, net resulted in income of $404,000 and $1.1 million for the
three months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease is
attributable to lower interest income related to lower cash balances versus the
year-ago period.

Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2000

  Revenue

   Total revenue decreased by $988,000, or 6%, to $14.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 2001, from $15.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2000. Licenses and associated maintenance revenue was 83% and 86% of total
revenue in the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
decrease in total revenue was due primarily to a decrease in software license
revenue. The United States and Europe have been experiencing a general decline
in economic conditions, which has led to reduced demand for a variety of goods
and services, including high technology goods and services. During the twelve
months ended September 30, 2001, Talarian saw a significant decrease in the
overall demand for its products and services that resulted in lower than
anticipated license revenue and greater than anticipated net loss. Talarian
believes that this decrease in demand was primarily due to general and industry
economic conditions. During 2001, Talarian saw increased

revenue from the financial services and aerospace vertical markets, which was
more than offset by decreased revenue from the telecommunications and high
technology (computer hardware/software manufacturers, e-commerce) sectors. One
customer accounted for 13% of Talarian's revenue during the year ended
September 30, 2001. No customer accounted for more than 10% of Talarian's total
revenue in the year ended September 30, 2000. International revenue decreased
by $200,000, or 7%, to $2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2001, from
$2.9 million from the year ended September 30, 2000. International revenue was
18% of Talarian's total revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

   Licenses.  License revenue decreased by $2.3 million, or 21%, to $8.3
million for the year ended September 30, 2001, from $10.6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2000. The decrease in license revenue was due to a decrease
in the number of SmartSockets software licenses sales, partially offset by an
increase in the number of SmartPGM software license sales. As a percentage of
total revenue, license revenue was 56% in the year ended September 30, 2001 and
67% in the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease in license revenue in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for both periods was a
result of a continued softness in the overall customer demand for software
licenses. Talarian has seen a shift from larger initial license transactions to
lower dollar transactions as customers become more cautious in their purchasing
decisions.

   Maintenance.  Maintenance revenue increased by $912,000, or 29%, to $4.0
million in the year ended September 30, 2001, from $3.1 million for the year
ended September 30, 2000. The increase in maintenance revenue was due to a
larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance services. As a
percentage of total revenue, maintenance revenue was 27% in the year ended
September 30, 2001 and 19% in the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase
in maintenance revenue as a percentage of overall revenue is due to the
reduction in license revenue.

   Professional services.  Professional services revenue increased by $362,000,
or 16%, to $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2001, from $2.2
million for the year ended September 30, 2000. A portion of the increase in
professional services revenue was a result of new customers obtained through
our acquisition of WhiteBarn on March 13, 2000. The remainder of the increase
in professional services revenue was attributable to an increase in training
and architectural services associated with large customer installations. As a
percentage of total revenue, professional services revenue was 17% in the year
ended September 30, 2001 and 14% in the year ended September 30, 2000.

  Cost of Revenue

   Cost of revenue increased by $559,000, or 16%, to $4.0 million for the year
ended September 30, 2001, from $3.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2000. The increase in cost of revenue was attributable to increased costs
during the first six months of Talarian's fiscal year related to its growing
maintenance and professional services departments, some of which resulted from
personnel acquired in connection with its acquisition of WhiteBarn. The
increase in cost of revenue was offset by a decrease of 24% in the amortization
of deferred stock compensation associated with terminated employees. As a
percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue was 27% in the year ended
September 30, 2001 and 21% in the year ended September 30, 2000. Not including
amortization of deferred stock compensation, as a percentage of total revenue,
cost of revenue was 21% in the year ended September 30, 2001 and 15% in the
year ended September 30, 2000. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage
of total revenue was the result of the increase in costs associated with
personnel responsible for delivering additional professional services revenue,
which typically has a lower gross margin than other types of revenue, personnel
increases associated with customer support to provide increased support
capabilities across a wider cross section of product lines, and lower overall
software license revenue.

   Licenses.  Cost of license revenue includes royalties due for technology
licensed from third parties, product packaging, manuals and documentation, and
software media. Cost of license revenue decreased by $94,000, or 39%, to
$146,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001, from $240,000 for the year
ended September 30, 2000. The decrease in cost of license revenue was
attributable to a decrease in overall license revenue, particularly

lower license revenue from royalty-bearing products. As a percentage of license
revenue, cost of license revenue was 1% in the year ended September 30, 2001
and 2% in the year ended September 30, 2000.

   Maintenance.  Cost of maintenance revenue consists of compensation and
related expenses for Talarian's technical support organization. Cost of
maintenance revenue increased by $440,000, or 51%, to $1.3 million for the year
ended September 30, 2001, from $864,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.
The increase in cost of maintenance revenue was due to increased personnel and
contractors hired during the first six months of the fiscal year in order to
provide increased support capabilities to Talarian's growing installed base of
customers across a broader product line. As a percentage of maintenance
revenue, cost of maintenance revenue was 32% in the year ended September 30,
2001 and 28% in the year ended September 30, 2000.

   Professional services.  Cost of professional services revenue consists of
compensation and related overhead expense for personnel and third-party
contractors Talarian uses in performing consulting, implementation, and
training services for its customers. Cost of professional services revenue
increased by $471,000, or 38%, to $1.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2001, from $1.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. A portion of the
dollar increase in cost of professional services revenue was a result of
consulting personnel acquired in the acquisition of WhiteBarn that were
employed for only a portion of fiscal year 2000, but all of 2001. The remainder
of the increase in cost of professional services revenue was a result of
additional personnel deployed on Talarian's professional services engagements
and an increase in management and other infrastructure associated with
delivering services. As a percentage of professional services revenue, cost of
professional services revenue was 66% in the year ended September 30, 2001 and
56% in the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase in the cost of
professional services revenue as a percentage of professional services revenue
was a result of increasing the management and other infrastructure associated
with delivering Talarian's professional services. Talarian anticipates that the
cost of professional services revenue will continue to increase or decrease in
terms of absolute dollars commensurate with professional services revenue.

   Amortization of deferred stock compensation.  Amortization of deferred stock
compensation in cost of revenues decreased by $258,000, to $814,000 for the
year ended September 30, 2001, from $1.1 million for the year ended September
30, 2000.

  Operating expenses

   Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include costs of sales
and marketing personnel and related overhead, commissions, field office
expenses, advertising and promotion expenses, travel and entertainment expenses
and other selling and marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased
by $3.7 million, or 40%, to $12.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2001, from $9.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase in
sales and marketing expenses was due to expansion of Talarian's sales and
marketing department personnel and locations and, to a lesser extent, increased
promotional programs during the first six months of Talarian's fiscal year. As
a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 87% in the
year ended September 30, 2001 and 58% in the year ended September 30, 2000.

   Research and development.  Research and development expenses consist of
costs of research and development personnel and associated overhead, and costs
of short-term independent contractors required in connection with development
of new products, enhancements to existing products, technical documentation,
and quality assurance. Costs incurred in research and development are expensed
as incurred until technological feasibility is established. Talarian believes
under its current engineering processes that the establishment of technological
feasibility and general release substantially coincide. As a result, no
software development costs have been capitalized to date. Research and
development expenses increased by $4.1 million, or 71%, to $9.8 million for the
year ended September 30, 2001, from $5.7 million for the year ended September
30, 2000. A portion of the increase in research and development was a result of
engineering personnel acquired in the acquisition of WhiteBarn that were
employed for only a portion of fiscal year 2000, but all of 2001. The remainder
of the increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in
personnel and consultants in Talarian's software development, quality
assurance, and documentation departments, hired primarily during the first six
months of the fiscal year. As a percentage of total revenue, research and
development expenses were 65% in the year ended September 30, 2001 and 36% in
the year ended September 30, 2000.

   General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses include
personnel costs for finance, administration, information systems and general
management, as well as professional fees, legal expenses, bad debt expense and
other general corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses increased
by $1.5 million, or 65%, to $3.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2001,
from $2.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was due to increased personnel expenses
incurred during the first six months of the fiscal year in finance and
administration and in information systems as well as increases in professional
fees associated with the additional requirements of being a public company. As
a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses were 26% in
the year ended September 30, 2001 and 15% in the year ended September 30, 2000.

   Amortization of deferred stock compensation.  During the year ended
September 30, 2001, Talarian recorded approximately $5.4 million of
amortization of deferred stock compensation in operating expenses, representing
$1.8 million of additional sales and marketing expenses, $2.2 million of
additional research and development expenses and $1.5 million of additional
general and administrative expenses. During the year ended September 30, 2000,
Talarian recorded $9.4 million of amortization of deferred stock compensation.

   Excess facilities cost.  During the year ended September 30, 2001, Talarian
recorded approximately $2.2 million of excess facilities costs in operating
expenses. This amount represents 900,000 of lease payments related to unused
facilities and $1.3 million accrued facility sublease losses for these excess
facilities. Talarian had no similar expenses in prior years. Management will
continue to monitor its committed facilities requirements which could result in
additional excess facility cost accruals.

   Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets.  Amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets was $3.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2001.
This amount represents the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
acquired in connection with Talarian's acquisition of GlobalCast in September
1999 and WhiteBarn in March 2000. During the year ended September 30, 2000,
Talarian recorded $1.8 million of amortization of goodwill and intangible
assets. Included in the $3.4 million of amortization of goodwill and intangible
assets for the twelve months ended September 30, 2001 was $1.2 million
representing a writedown of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with
the acquisition of GlobalCast. As of June 30, 2001, Talarian's stock price had
declined significantly since the respective valuation dates of the shares
issued in connection with each acquisition. Due to these changes, and the
changes in the markets in which Talarian competes in the United States and
global economy significantly diminishing the market for the proprietary
technology from GlobalCast, Talarian began a process to determine whether the
respective fair values of its goodwill and other intangible assets may be less
than their respective carrying values. This process included a detailed
analysis of estimated cash flows that Talarian expects to generate from future
operations for purposes of determining whether an impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets has occurred. As a result of Talarian's detailed
analysis and investigation, Talarian determined in the third quarter that there
was an impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of GlobalCast.
There was no impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of
WhiteBarn.

  Interest income, net

   Interest income, net consists of interest income net of interest expense.
Interest income, net resulted in income of $3.2 million for the year ended
September 30, 2001, compared to $994,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.
The resulting change of $2.2 million was attributable to Talarian's initial
public offering in July 2000. Talarian's average cash reserves in
interest-bearing accounts were significantly higher as a result of its initial
public offering, and its line of credit continued to remain unused during the
year ended September 30, 2001.

  Other expense

   Other expense consists of income tax expenses and losses on foreign currency
transactions. Other expenses resulted in losses of $62,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2001, compared to $35,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000.
This increase of $27,000 was attributable to the expansion of Talarian's
foreign operations.

Year Ended September 30, 2000 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1999

  Revenue

   Total revenue increased by $6.8 million, or 75%, to $15.9 million for the
year ended September 30, 2000, from $9.0 million for the year ended September
30, 1999. Licenses and associated maintenance revenue was 86% and 93% of total
revenue in the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
increase in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in software licenses
and associated maintenance revenue to new and existing customers and, to a
lesser extent, an increase in professional services revenue. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of Talarian's total revenue in the year ended
September 30, 2000. One customer accounted for 12% of Talarian's revenue during
the year ended September 30, 1999. International revenue increased by $500,000,
or 21%, to $2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $2.4
million from the year ended September 30, 1999. International revenue was 18%
and 26% of Talarian's total revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

   Licenses.  License revenue increased by $4.6 million, or 79%, to $10.6
million for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $5.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 1999. The increase in license revenue was due to an
increase in the number of software licenses to new and existing customers. This
increase was a result of the expansion of Talarian's sales force, a growing
acceptance for its infrastructure product line, and an increase in the average
dollar amount of a software license. As a percentage of total revenue, license
revenue was 67% in the year ended September 30, 2000 and 65% in the year ended
September 30, 1999.

   Maintenance.  Maintenance revenue increased by $606,000, or 24%, to $3.1
million for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $2.5 million for the year
ended September 30, 1999. The increase in maintenance revenue was due to growth
associated with license agreements entered into in earlier periods. As a
percentage of total revenue, maintenance revenue was 19% in the year ended
September 30, 2000 and 28% in the year ended September 30, 1999. The decrease
in maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended
September 30, 2000 when compared to the year ended September 30, 1999, was the
result of license and professional services revenue increasing at a
significantly greater percentage rate than maintenance revenue.

   Professional services.  Professional services revenue increased by $1.6
million, or 244%, to $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2000, from
$640,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999. Approximately 44% of the
increase in professional services revenue was a result of new customers
obtained through Talarian's acquisition of WhiteBarn on March 13, 2000. The
remainder of the increase in professional services revenue was attributable to
the increased license activity discussed above and an increase in training and
architectural services associated with an increase in customer installations.
In part, the increase in professional services revenue was attributable to an
increase in the average rate per hour billed for Talarian's professional
services technicians as they were increasingly engaged in senior-level
architectural design work as opposed to implementation services and training.
As a percentage of total revenue, professional services revenue was 14% in the
year ended September 30, 2000 and 7% in the year ended September 30, 1999.

  Cost of revenue

   Cost of revenue increased by $2.2 million, or 191%, to $3.4 million for the
year ended September 30, 2000, from $1.1 million for the year ended September
30, 1999. Approximately 46% of the increase in cost of revenue was a result of
an increase in amortization of deferred stock compensation for service-related
personnel. Approximately 25% of the increase in cost of revenue was a result of
increased professional services costs due to consulting personnel acquired in
Talarian's acquisition of WhiteBarn. The remainder of the increase in cost of
revenue was attributable to an increase in royalties to third parties and
increased costs related to Talarian's growing maintenance services and other
non-WhiteBarn-related professional services revenue. As a percentage of total
revenue, cost of revenue was 21% in the year ended September 30, 2000 and 13%
in the year ended September 30, 1999. Not including amortization of deferred
stock compensation, as a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue was 14%
in the year ended September 30, 2000 and 12% in the year ended September 30,
1999. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was the
result of the increase in costs associated with personnel responsible for
delivering additional professional services revenue, which typically has a
lower gross margin than other types of revenue.

   Licenses.  Cost of license revenue includes royalties due for technology
licensed from third parties, product packaging, manuals and documentation, and
software media. Cost of license revenue increased by $76,000, or 46%, to
$240,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $164,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1999. The increase in cost of license revenue was
attributable to increased royalties paid to a third party in connection with
Talarian's licensing of RMTP-II. As a percentage of license revenue, cost of
license revenue was 2% in the year ended September 30, 2000 and 3% in the year
ended September 30, 1999.
