Dear Stockholders:

     TeleCorp PCS, Inc., AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. and a wholly owned
subsidiary of AT&T Wireless have entered into a merger agreement under which
AT&T Wireless will acquire the capital stock of TeleCorp that it does not
currently own. We are proposing the merger because we believe the merger will
benefit the stockholders of TeleCorp, and we ask for your support in voting for
the merger proposal at our special meeting. The special meeting will be held on
[          ], 2002 at [     ].

     If the merger is completed, TeleCorp will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of AT&T Wireless and:

       receive 0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock; and

     - each share of TeleCorp series C and series E preferred stock will be
       converted into the right to receive a share of AT&T Wireless preferred
       stock that is substantially identical to the TeleCorp preferred share.

     The AT&T Wireless common stock issued in exchange for shares of TeleCorp
stock will be authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange upon
official notice of issuance under the ticker symbol "AWE."

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF TELECORP (WITH TWO DIRECTORS DISSENTING AND
WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE THREE DIRECTORS AFFILIATED WITH AT&T WIRELESS)

MERGER AS DESCRIBED IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. Information

                      WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

     AT&T Wireless has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
we refer to as the "SEC," a registration statement on Form S-4 under the
Securities Act of 1933 that registers the shares of AT&T Wireless common stock
and preferred stock to be issued to TeleCorp stockholders under the terms of the
merger agreement. This proxy statement/prospectus forms a part of that
registration statement and constitutes a prospectus of AT&T Wireless in addition
to being a proxy statement of TeleCorp for the special meeting. The registration
statement, including the exhibits and schedules to the registration statement,
contains additional relevant information about AT&T Wireless and the AT&T
Wireless common stock and preferred stock. The rules and regulations of the SEC
allow AT&T Wireless to omit some of the information included in the registration
statement and the exhibits and schedules to the registration statement from this
proxy statement/prospectus.

     In addition, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp each file annual, quarterly and
current reports, prospectuses and other information with the SEC.

     You may also read and copy this information at the Public Reference Section
of the SEC, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Room 1024, Washington, D.C. 20549. Further
information on the operation of the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington,
D.C. can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

     The SEC also maintains an internet world wide website that contains annual,
quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information about
issuers, including AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp, who file electronically with the
SEC. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov.

     AT&T Wireless common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and
TeleCorp class A voting common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market.
You may inspect annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and
other information about AT&T Wireless at the offices of the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc., 20 Broad Street, New York, NY 10005, and about TeleCorp at the
offices of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., 9801
Washingtonian Boulevard, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 (5th Floor).

     The SEC allows AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp to "incorporate by reference"
information in this proxy statement/prospectus. This means that AT&T Wireless
can disclose important business, financial and other information to you by
referring you to another document filed separately with the SEC. The information

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION?

A: AT&T Wireless will acquire the capital stock of TeleCorp that it does not
   currently own by merging TeleCorp into a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless.

Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: For each TeleCorp common share you own, you will receive 0.9 of a share of
   AT&T Wireless common stock. If you own TeleCorp preferred stock, you will
   receive either AT&T Wireless common stock or AT&T Wireless preferred stock,
   depending on which series of TeleCorp preferred stock you own.

Q: HOW DO I VOTE?

A: You vote by indicating on the enclosed proxy card how you want to vote and
   signing and mailing the enclosed proxy card, or by appearing in person at the
   special meeting. Please vote as soon as possible to ensure that your shares
   are represented at the special meeting.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME?

A: Your broker will vote your shares for you only if you provide instructions to
   your broker on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your
   broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without
   instructions, your shares will not be voted on the merger, which will have
   the same effect as voting against the merger.

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED IN MY SIGNED PROXY?

A: Yes. You can change your vote in one of three ways.

     - You can send to the Secretary of TeleCorp a written notice that is
       received before the special meeting stating that you would like to revoke
       your proxy.

     - You can complete and send to the Secretary of TeleCorp a new proxy card
       that is received before the special meeting.

     - You can attend, and vote in person by ballot at, the special meeting.

   You should send any written notice or a new proxy card to the Secretary of
   TeleCorp at the following address: TeleCorp PCS, Inc., 1010 N. Glebe Road,
   Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22201, Tel: (703) 236-1100.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp complete the merger, AT&T Wireless's
   exchange agent will send you instructions on how to exchange your share
   certificates.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A: We currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2002. Because
   the merger is subject to government approvals and other conditions, we cannot
   predict the exact timing.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS OR TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL COPIES OF THE PROXY
   STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS?

A: You should call Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. at 1-866-884-5922.

TeleCorp) and partner held 850 megahertz and 1900 megahertz licenses to provide
wireless services covering 98% of the U.S. population. AT&T Wireless has not
been affiliated with AT&T Corp., its former corporate parent, since its
split-off from AT&T Corp. on July 9, 2001.

     TeleCorp PCS, Inc.
     1010 N. Glebe Road
     Suite 800

service area covering approximately 37 million people.

THE SPECIAL MEETING (SEE PAGE 28)

     The special meeting of TeleCorp stockholders will be held at [          ],
on [          ], 2002, at [  ]:00 a.m., local time. At the special meeting, you
will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger
agreement.

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED (SEE PAGES 28 AND 29)

     Only TeleCorp stockholders at the close of business on the record date,
[          ], will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting.

     Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of outstanding TeleCorp capital stock entitled to
vote, voting together as one class in accordance with TeleCorp's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation. Stockholders of TeleCorp holding a
majority of the voting power of outstanding TeleCorp capital stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting have entered into voting agreements to vote in favor
of the merger. See "Voting Agreements" below.

     No vote of AT&T Wireless stockholders is required to approve the merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 82)

     The merger agreement is the legal document that governs the merger. The
merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus,
and we encourage you to read it carefully.

WHAT TELECORP STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 82)

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of TeleCorp common stock and
preferred stock will be converted into a right to receive securities of AT&T
Wireless, as follows:

Common Stock..............................  0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock
Series C and E preferred stock............  one share of AT&T Wireless preferred stock with
                                              substantially identical terms
Series A convertible preferred stock......  82.9849 shares of AT&T Wireless common stock

Series D preferred stock..................  27.6425 shares of AT&T Wireless common stock
Series F and G preferred stock............  0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock

FAIRNESS OPINIONS (SEE PAGE 42)

     TeleCorp's financial advisors, Lehman Brothers Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Securities, each delivered their oral opinions to the TeleCorp board of
directors at the October 7, 2001 meeting of the TeleCorp board of directors,
which were subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of October
7, 2001, and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other matters set forth in the opinions, the applicable
exchange ratio to be received in the merger by (1) the holders (other than AT&T
Wireless) of TeleCorp common stock, other than voting preference common stock,
is fair, from a financial point of view, to those stockholders and (2) the
holders (other than AT&T Wireless) of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock is
fair, from a financial point of view, to those stockholders. Copies of these
opinions are attached as Appendices D and E to this proxy statement/prospectus.
We urge you to read these opinions in their entirety.

RECOMMENDATION OF TELECORP'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 37)

     Based on TeleCorp's reasons for the merger described in this proxy
statement/prospectus, including the fairness opinions from Lehman Brothers and
JPMorgan, the TeleCorp board of directors (with two directors dissenting and
without the participation of the three directors affiliated with AT&T Wireless)
determined the merger is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
TeleCorp's stockholders and has approved the merger agreement. The TeleCorp
board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" adoption of the merger
agreement at the special meeting.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 91)

     As an inducement to AT&T Wireless to enter into the merger agreement,
Gerald T. Vento, TeleCorp's chief executive officer, Thomas H. Sullivan,
TeleCorp's chief financial officer, and other stockholders have entered into
voting agreements with AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp. In these agreements, holders
of a majority of the voting power of outstanding TeleCorp capital stock entitled
to vote at the special meeting agreed to vote all of their shares of TeleCorp
capital stock in favor of the merger and against proposals for other
transactions. Accordingly, stockholder approval of the merger is assured. Those
TeleCorp stockholders also agreed, with specific exceptions, not to transfer
their shares of TeleCorp capital stock before the completion of the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 57)

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp were required to make notifications under U.S.
federal antitrust laws and to allow a required waiting period to expire or
terminate. On October 23, 2001 and October 24, 2001, respectively, AT&T Wireless
and TeleCorp submitted the required notifications. On November 19, 2001, AT&T
Wireless and TeleCorp received notification that early termination of the
waiting period under the U.S. federal antitrust laws was granted.

     In addition, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp are required to obtain approvals
from the Federal Communications Commission, which we refer to as the "FCC." On
October 19, 2001 and October 22, 2001, respectively, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp
filed the required applications with the FCC, seeking approval of the transfer
of control to AT&T Wireless of the FCC licenses and authorizations held by

TeleCorp subsidiaries. The applications have been listed on an FCC Public
Notice. Interested parties may file comments or petitions to deny until December
10, 2001.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 88)

     Completion of the merger depends upon a number of conditions being
satisfied or waived by the party entitled to assert the condition. The
conditions to the merger include:

     - approval of the merger agreement by TeleCorp stockholders;

     - obtaining the final approval of the FCC without the imposition of
       conditions that would materially impair the ability of AT&T Wireless to
       operate its business or that of TeleCorp;

     - dissenters' rights not being asserted for shares representing more than
       5% of the voting power of TeleCorp stock;

     - receipt of legal opinions regarding the treatment of the merger as a
       "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
       Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

     - termination of the TeleCorp management agreement with no further
       obligations on the part of TeleCorp, although particular provisions will
       survive;

     - calling by TeleCorp, on or before January 15, 2002, of the unfunded
       commitment of specific investors of TeleCorp under the TeleCorp Stock
       Purchase Agreement, dated January 23, 1998; and

     - other customary conditions specified in the merger agreement.

     The merger will occur as soon as practicable after TeleCorp and AT&T
Wireless satisfy or waive all of the conditions in the merger agreement.

TERMINATION (SEE PAGE 89)

     The merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger abandoned, only in a
limited number of circumstances, including the following:

     - if the merger is not completed by August 7, 2002, which may be extended
       to March 7, 2003 if the merger has not been completed solely due to the
       waiting period (or any extension thereof) or approvals under U.S. federal
       antitrust laws or approvals or consent of the FCC not having expired or
       been terminated or received;

     - if the merger agreement is not approved by TeleCorp stockholders at the
       special meeting;

     - by AT&T Wireless, if the TeleCorp board of directors withdraws or
       adversely modifies its recommendation of the merger to TeleCorp
       stockholders; or if the TeleCorp board of directors approves, or
       determines to recommend to the stockholders of TeleCorp that they
       approve, an alternative acquisition proposal; or if for any reason
       TeleCorp fails to call or hold the special meeting within six months of
       the date of the merger agreement, with an exception relating to the date
       that the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus
       is a part becomes effective;

     - if there is a final, non-appealable legal prohibition against the merger;

     - if AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp agree to terminate the merger agreement;
       and

     - by either AT&T Wireless or TeleCorp if the other party breaches in any
       material respect any of its representations or warranties or fails to
       perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements
       in the merger agreement, if the breach or failure to perform cannot be
       cured by August 7, 2002 (or March 7, 2003 as described above) and renders
       any condition incapable of being satisfied by that date.

TERMINATION FEE (SEE PAGE 90)

     The merger agreement provides for a termination fee of $65 million to be
paid by TeleCorp to AT&T Wireless in the following cases:

     - if AT&T Wireless terminates the merger agreement because TeleCorp fails
       to call or hold the TeleCorp special meeting within six months of the
       date of the merger agreement, with an exception relating to the date that
       the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a
       part becomes effective;

     - if either AT&T Wireless or TeleCorp terminates the merger agreement
       because the merger agreement is not adopted by TeleCorp stockholders at
       the special meeting; or

     - if an alternative acquisition proposal has been made and AT&T Wireless
       terminates the merger agreement because TeleCorp has failed to satisfy a
       closing condition relating to representations or warranties or covenants,
       and within 12 months of termination TeleCorp enters into a definitive
       agreement for any alternative transaction or its board of directors
       recommends acceptance by the TeleCorp stockholders of a tender offer or
       exchange offer for an alternative transaction.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF TELECORP IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 58)

     Some members of TeleCorp management and of the TeleCorp board of directors
have interests in the merger or relationships with AT&T Wireless that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other TeleCorp
stockholders. The TeleCorp board of directors was aware of these interests and
relationships and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger
agreement and the related transactions.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 56)

     In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, AT&T Wireless will use
the purchase method of accounting for a business combination to account for the
merger, as well as new accounting and reporting regulations for goodwill and
other intangibles.

TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 55)

     We have structured the merger to be a tax-free reorganization for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and it is a condition to the merger that AT&T
Wireless and TeleCorp each receive legal opinions to that effect. Assuming the
merger is a reorganization, holders of TeleCorp class A voting common stock will
not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the merger,
except for gain or loss recognized because of cash received instead of
fractional shares of AT&T Wireless common stock.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 80)

     Under Delaware law, holders of TeleCorp class A voting common stock are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

     Holders of all other classes of TeleCorp stock are entitled under Delaware
law to seek appraisal of and payment of the fair value of their shares in lieu
of receiving the merger consideration, as long as these stockholders comply with
the procedural requirements set forth under Delaware law for perfecting this
right, as described in the section entitled "The Merger -- Appraisal Rights" and
set forth in Appendix F.

                AT&T WIRELESS SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     In the table below you are provided with selected historical consolidated
financial data of AT&T Wireless. For periods prior to AT&T Wireless's split-off
from AT&T Corp. on July 9, 2001, this selected historical financial data
reflects the results of and balance sheet data for the AT&T Wireless Group of
AT&T Corp. In the split-off, AT&T Corp. contributed to AT&T Wireless all of the
businesses and assets, and AT&T Wireless assumed all of the liabilities, that
constituted the AT&T Wireless Group. These contributions have been accounted for
in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.

     The following information was derived using the consolidated financial
statements of AT&T Wireless at and for each of the nine months ended September
30, 2001 and 2000, and each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended
December 31, 2000. The consolidated statement of operations and cash flow data
below for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000 and
the consolidated balance sheet data at December 31, 2000 and 1999, were derived
from audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The consolidated statement of
operations and cash flow data below for the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1996 and the consolidated balance sheet data at December 31, 1998, 1997, and
1996, were derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements. The data
for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 were derived from
unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus. Data presented under the heading "Other
Operating Data" is not derived from audited or unaudited historical consolidated
financial statements and has been presented to provide additional information.

     The financial data presented below is not necessarily comparable from
period to period as a result of several transactions, including acquisitions and
dispositions of consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, in October 2001, AT&T
Wireless announced its intention to exit the fixed wireless business. Although
exit plans have not yet been approved by AT&T Wireless's board of directors, it
is anticipated that this decision will result in pre-tax charges during the
fourth quarter of 2001 of approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting a write-down of
the assets and the impact of a phased exit plan. For this and other reasons, you
should read the selected historical financial data provided below in conjunction
with AT&T Wireless's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes,
which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus (See
"Where You Can Find More Information") as well as the pro forma financial
information included in this proxy statement/prospectus (See "Unaudited AT&T
Wireless Pro Forma Financial Information").

(1) Includes $4 million of long-term debt that is included in other long-term
    liabilities at September 30, 2000, and at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

(2) EBITDA is defined as operating income, plus depreciation and amortization.
    AT&T Wireless believes EBITDA to be relevant and useful information, as
    EBITDA is the primary metric used by AT&T Wireless management to measure the
    performance of its business. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but
    not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including its cash
    flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

(3) Population, or POPs (the number of persons within a license's coverage
    area), represent AT&T Wireless's consolidated operations and do not include
    partnership or affiliate markets. POPs are counted once whether a POP is
    covered/licensed only by wireless licenses at the 850 megahertz frequency or
    wireless licenses at the 1900 megahertz frequency or by both. The amount of
    wireless spectrum licensed varies by geographic territory.

                       COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The table below contains AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp per share information
as of September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 on both a historical and pro
forma basis and on a per share equivalent pro forma basis for TeleCorp.

     AT&T Wireless's historical per share information as of September 30, 2001
was calculated on the basis of the number of shares of AT&T Wireless common
stock outstanding on that date. AT&T Wireless's historical per share information
as of December 31, 2000 was computed based on the 2.53 billion shares of AT&T
Wireless common stock outstanding at the time of the split-off from AT&T Corp.
on July 9, 2001, including the 406 million shares issued in conjunction with the
investment by NTT DoCoMo which occurred in January 2001. The AT&T Wireless
combined pro forma information gives effect to the merger with TeleCorp and
those transactions identified in the pro forma financial information included in
this proxy statement/prospectus. The TeleCorp combined pro forma equivalent
information is based on the assumed conversion of each of the TeleCorp common
shares into 0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock.

     Cash dividends have never been paid on AT&T Wireless common stock, AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock or TeleCorp common stock.

     You should read the information below together with the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp
included in the documents that are described under "Where You Can Find More
Information" and which are incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by
reference as well as the pro forma financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus (See "Unaudited AT&T Wireless Pro Forma Financial
Information"). You should not rely on the unaudited historical comparative per

position that would have been achieved if the merger had taken place earlier or
of the results of operations or financial position of AT&T Wireless after
completion of the merger.

DIVIDENDS

     TeleCorp has never declared or paid cash dividends. If the merger does not
occur, TeleCorp currently intends to retain earnings. TeleCorp's board of
directors will determine whether to pay dividends on its

common stock primarily based upon the company's financial condition, results of
its operations, requirements of any financing agreements to which it is a party,
and its business requirements.

     Cash dividends have never been declared or paid on AT&T Wireless common
stock or, prior to AT&T Wireless's split-off from AT&T Corp. on July 9, 2001, on
AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. AT&T Wireless's board of directors will
determine whether to pay dividends on its common stock primarily based upon the
company's financial condition, results of its operations, requirements of any
financing agreements to which it may be a party, and its business requirements;
however, AT&T Wireless does not expect to pay any dividends on its common stock
for the foreseeable future.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider each of the
following risks and uncertainties related to the merger.

  Risk Factors Relating to the Merger

     THE VALUE OF AT&T WIRELESS COMMON STOCK MAY DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN
THE TIME YOU VOTE ON THE MERGER AND THE TIME THE MERGER IS COMPLETED. AS A
RESULT, AT THE TIME YOU VOTE ON THE MERGER YOU WILL NOT KNOW THE MARKET VALUE OF
THE AT&T WIRELESS COMMON STOCK YOU WILL RECEIVE FOR YOUR TELECORP SHARES.

     The exchange ratio for the number of shares of AT&T Wireless common stock
you are to receive in exchange for your shares of TeleCorp common stock and
preferred stock is fixed, and the merger agreement contains no mechanism to
adjust the exchange ratio in the event that the market price of AT&T Wireless
common stock declines prior to the merger.

     THE FCC MUST APPROVE THE MERGER AND COULD DELAY OR REFUSE TO APPROVE THE
MERGER OR IMPOSE CONDITIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OR
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

     U.S. federal law and FCC rules require the FCC's prior approval of the
transfer of control of TeleCorp's licenses to AT&T Wireless. Completion of the
merger is conditioned, among other factors, upon grants of the requisite FCC
consents becoming final. A "final" FCC order is one that has not been stayed and
is no longer subject to review by the FCC or the courts because the statutory
period for seeking such review has expired without any request for review or
stay pending. Following the FCC's grant of consent to the merger, there might be
actions by the FCC or the courts that would delay or prevent finality.

     The FCC might not grant the applications for transfer of control or the FCC
might grant the applications with conditions. In addition, there might be a
delay caused by the filing of a challenge to the transfer applications.
Conditions imposed on any licenses granted or delays in granting of the licenses
could jeopardize or delay completion of the merger or may impair the value of
the licenses and reduce the value of AT&T Wireless capital stock.

     WE MAY FAIL TO INTEGRATE OUR OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY. AS A RESULT, WE MAY
NOT ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The merger will combine two companies that have previously operated
independently. We expect to face significant challenges in consolidating
operations, integrating our organizations and services in a timely and efficient
manner, refinancing or consolidating indebtedness and retaining key TeleCorp
executives and other personnel. The integration of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp
also will require substantial attention from management, particularly in light
of the geographically dispersed operations and different business cultures and
compensation structures at the two companies. In addition, after the completion
of the merger, AT&T Wireless may elect, or be required, to refinance or
renegotiate all or a portion of the TeleCorp long-term debt not held by AT&T
Wireless and, in doing so, AT&T Wireless may incur additional costs. The
diversion of management attention and any difficulties associated with
integrating the two companies could have a material adverse effect on the
revenues, the level of expenses and the operating and financial results of the
combined company and the value of AT&T Wireless capital stock.

  Risk Factors Relating to AT&T Wireless's Common Stock

     AT&T CORP.'S SALE, EXCHANGE OR MONETIZATION OF AT&T WIRELESS'S COMMON STOCK
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS MARKET PRICE.

     In connection with AT&T Wireless's split-off from AT&T Corp., its former
corporate parent, on July 9, 2001, AT&T Corp. retained approximately 91 million
shares, or about 3.6%, of AT&T Wireless's common stock for its own account for
sale, exchange or monetization. The sale, exchange or monetization of these
shares, or the perception by the market that these transactions might occur,
could adversely affect the market price of AT&T Wireless's common stock.

     FUTURE SALES OF AT&T WIRELESS'S COMMON STOCK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
COMMON STOCK'S MARKET PRICE AND AT&T WIRELESS'S ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE
FUTURE.

     Sales of substantial amounts of AT&T Wireless's common stock, including any
sales by AT&T Corp., could hurt the common stock's market price. This also could
hurt AT&T Wireless's ability to raise capital in the future. Any sales of
substantial amounts of AT&T Wireless's common stock in the public market, or the
perception that those sales might occur, could materially adversely affect the
market price of AT&T Wireless's common stock. AT&T Wireless will not solicit the
approval of its stockholders for the issuance of authorized but unissued shares
of its stock unless this approval is deemed advisable by its board of directors
or is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange listing
requirements. The issuance of those shares could dilute the value of shares of
AT&T Wireless's common stock.

     AT&T WIRELESS DOES NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK.

     AT&T Wireless's board of directors will determine whether to pay dividends
on its common stock primarily based upon the company's financial condition,
results of its operations and its business requirements. AT&T Wireless does not
expect to pay any dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future.

     THE MARKET PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME OF AT&T WIRELESS'S COMMON STOCK MAY BE
VOLATILE AND MAY FACE NEGATIVE PRESSURE.

     Numerous factors may result in short- or long-term negative pressure on the
trading price of shares of AT&T Wireless's common stock, including sales of its
common stock by AT&T Corp. The market price of AT&T Wireless's common stock
could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the
risk factors listed in this document, or for specific reasons unrelated to AT&T
Wireless's performance. Investors may consider AT&T Wireless's common stock as a
technology stock. Technology stocks have recently experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. Therefore, the market price and trading volume of AT&T
Wireless's common stock also may be extremely volatile.

  Risk Factors Relating to AT&T Wireless's Business

AT&T WIRELESS'S PLAN TO EXIT THE FIXED WIRELESS BUSINESS MAY HAVE UNFORESEEN
NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO ITS BUSINESS.

     In October 2001, AT&T Wireless announced its intention to exit its fixed
wireless business. Although exit plans have not yet been approved by AT&T
Wireless's board of directors, AT&T Wireless currently anticipates that its
decision to exit its fixed wireless business will result in fourth quarter
pre-tax charges of approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting a write-down of the
assets of the fixed wireless business and the impact of phased exit charges. The
decision to exit a business involves special risks and uncertainties, some of
which may not be foreseeable or within AT&T Wireless's control, such as
unforeseen severance costs, contractual liabilities, disputes with customers,
suppliers, vendors, terminated employees, or a buyer of the fixed wireless
business or certain assets.

     In addition, AT&T Wireless faces a number of other uncertainties and risks
relating to its exit from the fixed wireless business including the following:

     - AT&T Wireless may not be able to sell or otherwise monetize any part of
       its assets of the fixed wireless business on attractive terms or at all;

     - the time it takes AT&T Wireless and the costs it incurs to exit from its
       fixed wireless business may be affected by regulatory concerns and other
       matters;

     - AT&T Wireless's implementation of the exit strategy may disrupt other
       operations and distract management from other needs of its business; and

     - perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of AT&T Wireless may
       result in the loss of employees or business partners.

     Such unforeseen costs and uncertainties could have a material adverse
effect on AT&T Wireless's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

     AT&T WIRELESS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE ITS DEBT IN THE FUTURE, WHICH
COULD SUBJECT IT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS AND HIGHER INTEREST COSTS AND DECREASE
ITS CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS.

     AT&T Wireless may substantially increase its debt in the future (including
by virtue of the debt it is assuming under the merger), which could subject it
to various restrictions and higher interest costs and decrease its cash flow and
earnings. AT&T Wireless may also encounter difficulties in obtaining all the
financing it needs to fund its business and growth strategy on desirable terms.

     AT&T Wireless anticipates requiring substantial additional financing for
the foreseeable future to fund capital expenditures, license purchases and costs
and expenses in connection with funding its operations, domestic and
international investments and growth strategy. AT&T Wireless is exploring and
evaluating the relative advantages and disadvantages of various funding
mechanisms. Other funding mechanisms that still may be considered include other
forms of public and private debt facilities. The decision on debt composition is
dependent on, among other things, AT&T Wireless's business and financial plans
and the market conditions at the time of financing. The agreements governing
this indebtedness may contain financial and other covenants that could impair
AT&T Wireless's flexibility and restrict its ability to pursue growth
opportunities.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S RELATIONSHIP WITH NTT DOCOMO, INC. CONTAINS FEATURES THAT
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT AT&T WIRELESS'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR THE WAY IN WHICH
ITS BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED.

     DoCoMo, a leading Japanese wireless communications company, is AT&T
Wireless's largest stockholder, and the agreements relating to DoCoMo's
investment contain requirements and contingencies that could materially
adversely affect AT&T Wireless's financial condition and technology strategies.
The terms of the DoCoMo investment enable DoCoMo to terminate its investment and
require repayment of its $9.8 billion investment, plus interest, if AT&T
Wireless fails, under some circumstances, to commence service using an agreed-on
technology in at least 13 of the top 50 domestic markets by June 30, 2004. If
DoCoMo requires repayment, AT&T Wireless will have to fund the entire repurchase
obligation. If DoCoMo requires repayment of its investment, it may also
terminate the technology rights provided to AT&T Wireless in connection with its
investment. AT&T Wireless needs to obtain DoCoMo's consent to make any
fundamental change in the nature of AT&T Wireless's business or to allow another
wireless operator to acquire more than 15% but less than 50% of AT&T Wireless's
equity. These limitations could prevent AT&T Wireless from taking advantage of
some business opportunities or relationships that it might otherwise pursue.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S SIGNIFICANT NETWORK BUILD-OUT REQUIREMENTS MAY NOT BE
COMPLETED AS PLANNED.

     AT&T Wireless needs to complete significant build-out activities, including
completion of regularly required build-out activities in some of its existing
wireless markets. Failure or delay to complete the build-out of its network and
launch of operations, or increased costs of this build-out and launch of
operations, could have a material adverse effect on AT&T Wireless's operations
and financial condition. As AT&T Wireless continues to build out its network, it
must, among other things, continue to:

     - lease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to a large number of cell and
       switch sites;

     - obtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party
       approvals or permits for network construction;

     - complete the radio frequency design, including cell site design,
       frequency planning and network optimization, for each of its markets; and

     - expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other
       financial and management systems.

     In addition, in the next several years, AT&T Wireless will be upgrading its
network to implement the next generation of digital technology. These events may
not occur in the time frame AT&T Wireless assumes or that the FCC requires, at
the cost AT&T Wireless assumes, or at all.

     In addition, problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources
or system performance could delay the launch of new or expanded operations in
new or existing markets or result in increased costs in all markets. AT&T
Wireless intends to rely on the services of various companies that are
experienced in design and build-out of wireless networks in order to accomplish
its build-out schedule. However, AT&T Wireless may not be able to obtain
satisfactory contractors on economically attractive terms or ensure that its
contractors will perform as it expects.

     AT&T WIRELESS HAS SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT IT MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO FUND.

     AT&T Wireless's strategy and business plan will continue to require
substantial capital, which it may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at
all. A failure to obtain necessary capital would have a material adverse effect
on AT&T Wireless, and result in the delay, change or abandonment of its
development or expansion plans and the failure to meet regulatory build out
requirements. AT&T Wireless currently estimates that its capital expenditures
for the build out of its mobility networks will total approximately $5.0 billion
during 2001, as compared to $3.7 billion in 2000. It also expects to incur
substantial capital expenditures in future years. The actual amount of the funds
required to finance AT&T Wireless's network build-out and other capital
expenditures may vary materially from management's estimate. AT&T Wireless has
entered into various contractual commitments associated with the development of
its third-generation strategy, of which approximately $1.9 billion were
outstanding at September 30, 2001. These include purchase commitments for
network equipment, as well as handsets. In addition, AT&T Wireless anticipates
that it will enter into material purchase commitments in the future. It also may
require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, acquisitions of
providers of wireless services, spectrum license or system acquisitions, system
development and network capacity expansion. AT&T Wireless has also entered into
agreements for investments and ventures which have required or will require
substantial capital, including its agreement to invest $2.6 billion in exchange
for a combination of a non-controlling equity interest in, and debt securities
issued by, Alaska Native Wireless, which was the successful bidder for licenses
costing approximately $2.9 billion in the recently concluded 1900 megahertz
auction. These agreements also may contain provisions potentially requiring
substantial additional capital in future circumstances, such as allowing the
other investors to require AT&T Wireless to purchase assets or investments.

     THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT AT&T WIRELESS'S STRATEGY
AND BUSINESS PLAN MAY MATERIALLY EXCEED CURRENT ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AT&T WIRELESS'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

     The actual amount of funds necessary to implement AT&T Wireless's strategy
and business plan may materially exceed AT&T Wireless's current estimates in the
event of various factors including: departures from its current business plan,
unforeseen delays, cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory
developments, engineering design changes, and technological and other risks. If
actual costs do materially exceed AT&T Wireless's current estimates for these or
other reasons, this could have a material adverse effect on AT&T Wireless's
financial condition and results of operations.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT
FAILED TO ACQUIRE ADEQUATE RADIO SPECTRUM IN FCC AUCTIONS OR THROUGH OTHER
TRANSACTIONS.

     AT&T Wireless's domestic business depends on the ability to use portions of
the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. AT&T Wireless could fail to obtain
sufficient spectrum capacity in new and existing markets, whether through FCC
auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the expanded demands for its
existing services, as well as to enable development of third-generation
services. This type of failure would have a material adverse impact on the
quality of AT&T Wireless's services or its ability to roll out such future
services in some markets. AT&T Wireless intends to continue to acquire more
spectrum through a combination of alternatives, including participation in
spectrum auctions, purchase of spectrum

licenses from companies that own them or purchase of these companies outright.
As required by law, the FCC periodically conducts auctions for licenses to use
some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the
determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction,
are provided for by laws administered by the FCC. The FCC may not allocate
spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain licenses.
Even if the FCC determines to conduct further auctions in the future, AT&T
Wireless may not be successful in those future auctions in obtaining the
spectrum that it believes is necessary to implement its business and technology
strategies. AT&T Wireless may also seek to acquire radio spectrum through
purchases and swaps with other spectrum licensees or otherwise, including by
purchases of other licensees outright. However, AT&T Wireless may not be able to
acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and it may not
be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE HURT IF IT IS UNABLE TO
ESTABLISH NEW AFFILIATES TO EXPAND ITS DIGITAL NETWORK OR IF ITS EXISTING OR ANY
NEW AFFILIATES DO NOT OR CANNOT DEVELOP THEIR SYSTEMS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT
WITH AT&T WIRELESS'S SYSTEMS.

     To accelerate the build out of widescale coverage of the United States by a
digital mobile wireless network operating on the technical standards AT&T
Wireless has adopted, AT&T Wireless has entered into affiliation agreements with
other entities that provide wireless service or hold spectrum licenses. Through
contractual arrangements between AT&T Wireless and these affiliates, AT&T
Wireless's customers are able to obtain service in the affiliates' territories,
and the affiliates' customers are able to obtain service in AT&T Wireless's
territory. In all markets where these affiliates operate, AT&T Wireless is at
risk because it does not control the affiliates. As a result, these affiliates
are not obligated to implement AT&T Wireless's third-generation strategy. AT&T
Wireless's ability to provide service on a nationwide level and to implement its
third-generation strategy would be adversely affected if these affiliates decide
not to participate in the further development of AT&T Wireless's digital
network. AT&T Wireless may establish additional affiliate relationships to
accelerate build out of its digital mobile network. If AT&T Wireless is unable
to establish such affiliate relationships, or if any such affiliates are unable
to or do not develop their systems in a manner consistent with AT&T Wireless's
network, AT&T Wireless's ability to service its customers and expand the
geographic coverage of its digital network could be adversely affected.

     IF THE FCC DENIES ALASKA NATIVE WIRELESS'S APPLICATION TO ACQUIRE LICENSES
FOR WHICH IT WAS THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER IN THE RECENT SPECTRUM AUCTION, OR, IN
THE FUTURE, REVOKES LICENSES AWARDED TO ALASKA NATIVE WIRELESS, AT&T WIRELESS'S
ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS THIRD-GENERATION STRATEGY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
OR IT COULD BECOME OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE OTHER INVESTORS' INTERESTS IN ALASKA
NATIVE WIRELESS.

     AT&T Wireless has agreed to invest $2.6 billion in exchange for a
combination of a non-controlling equity interest in and debt securities issued
by Alaska Native Wireless, which was the successful bidder for licenses costing
$2.9 billion in the recently concluded 1900 megahertz auction, which occurred in
early 2001. One auction participant has challenged the qualifications of Alaska
Native Wireless to acquire "closed" licenses, which constituted most of the
licenses for which Alaska Native Wireless was the successful bidder. If the FCC
determines that Alaska Native Wireless was not qualified, the FCC could refuse
to grant Alaska Native Wireless the closed licenses. On June 22, 2001, a federal
appeals court ruled in favor of the trustee in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceeding of NextWave Telecom, Inc. and the unsecured creditors of NextWave
with respect to the litigation they commenced relating to the 1900 megahertz
auction. The court ruled that the FCC had acted improperly in repossessing from
NextWave the spectrum offered in the 1900 megahertz auction. The United States,
the FCC, NextWave Telecom, Inc. and several of its affiliates and certain
winning bidders in the 1900 megahertz auction, including Alaska Native Wireless,
signed a settlement agreement effective as of November 26, 2001. Under the
settlement agreement, NextWave and its affiliates would return all of those
licenses to the FCC, which thereafter would award the licenses in accordance
with the auction. The settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including
bankruptcy court approval and the adoption of federal legislation necessary to
implement the terms of the settlement. If this settlement does not become
effective, or if the appeals court decision is not appealed or otherwise
settled, or if Alaska Native Wireless is otherwise unable to acquire

the licenses for which it was the successful bidder, it could have a significant
adverse impact on AT&T Wireless's opportunities to provide or enhance services
in key new and existing markets. In specified circumstances, if a winning bid of
Alaska Native Wireless in the recently concluded 1900 megahertz spectrum auction
is rejected or if any license granted to it is revoked, AT&T Wireless would
become obligated to compensate other investors for making capital available to
the venture. In specified circumstances, if the grant of those licenses is
challenged, AT&T Wireless may be obligated to purchase the interests of other
investors.

     IF AT&T WIRELESS IS UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH ALASKA NATIVE WIRELESS
REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF LICENSES FOR WHICH IT WAS THE SUCCESSFUL
BIDDER IN THE RECENT SPECTRUM AUCTION, ITS ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS
THIRD-GENERATION STRATEGY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

     AT&T Wireless has not reached any agreements with Alaska Native Wireless as
to whether it will participate in AT&T Wireless's digital mobile wireless
network. Alaska Native Wireless is not obligated to use or develop any spectrum
it acquires in a manner that will further, or be consistent with, AT&T
Wireless's strategic objectives, although Alaska Native Wireless is obligated to
use technology that is compatible and interoperable with AT&T Wireless's digital
mobile wireless network. If Alaska Native Wireless does not enter into
agreements with AT&T Wireless regarding the use and development of this spectrum
similar to those AT&T Wireless has entered into with its affiliates for its
existing networks, AT&T Wireless could experience a material adverse impact on
the timing and cost of implementing its third-generation strategy.

     POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS MAY REQUIRE AT&T WIRELESS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL
ADDITIONAL DEBT AND INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OPERATIONS AND SERVICES, WHICH
MAY BE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING.

     An element of AT&T Wireless's strategy is to expand its network, which it
intends to accomplish in part through the acquisition of TeleCorp and which it
may pursue through other acquisitions of licenses, systems and wireless
providers. The acquisition of TeleCorp will result in AT&T Wireless's assumption
of substantial additional indebtedness. Further, other acquisitions may cause
AT&T Wireless to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance such
acquisitions or to assume indebtedness of the entities that are acquired. In
addition, AT&T Wireless may encounter difficulties in integrating those acquired
operations into its own operations, including as a result of different
technologies, systems, services or service offerings. These actions could prove
costly or time-consuming or divert its management's attention from other
business matters.

     FAILURE TO DEVELOP FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT
ON AT&T WIRELESS'S GROWTH POTENTIAL.

     AT&T Wireless intends to pursue a number of new growth opportunities,
primarily related to wireless data services. The ability to deploy and deliver
these services relies, in many instances, on new and unproven technology. AT&T
Wireless's existing technology may not perform as expected and AT&T Wireless may
not be able to successfully develop new technology to effectively and
economically deliver these services. These opportunities also require
substantial capital outlays and spectrum availability to deploy on a large
scale. This capital or spectrum may not be available to support these services.
The success of wireless data services is substantially dependent on the ability
of others to develop applications for wireless devices and to develop and
manufacture devices that support wireless applications. These applications or
devices may not be developed or developed in sufficient quantities to support
the deployment of wireless data services. These services may not be widely
introduced and fully implemented at all or in a timely fashion. These services
may not be successful when they are in place, and customers may not purchase the
services offered. If these services are not successful or costs associated with
implementation and completion of the rollout of these services materially exceed
those currently estimated by us, AT&T Wireless's financial condition and
prospects could be materially adversely affected.

     AT&T WIRELESS FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION.

     There is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications
industry. AT&T Wireless expects competition to intensify as a result of the
entry of new competitors and the development of new

technologies, products and services. Other two-way wireless providers, including
other cellular and personal communications services, operators and resellers,
serve each of the markets in which AT&T Wireless competes. A majority of U.S.
markets likely will have five or more commercial mobile radio service providers,
and all of the top 50 U.S. metropolitan markets likely will have at least four,
and in some cases as many as seven or more, facilities-based wireless service
providers offering wireless services on cellular, personal communications
services or specialized mobile radio frequency. Competition also may increase to
the extent that smaller, stand-alone wireless providers transfer licenses to
larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers.

     MARKET PRICES FOR WIRELESS SERVICES MAY DECLINE IN THE FUTURE.

     AT&T Wireless anticipates that market prices for two-way wireless services
generally will decline in the future due to increased competition. AT&T Wireless
expects significant competition among wireless providers, including from new
entrants, to continue to drive service and equipment prices lower. AT&T Wireless
also expects that there will be increases in advertising and promotional
spending, along with increased demands on access to distribution channels. All
of this may lead to greater choices for customers, possible consumer confusion,
and increasing movement of customers between competitors, which AT&T Wireless
refers to as "churn." AT&T Wireless may also adopt customer policies or programs
to be more competitive, including credit policies, which policies or programs
may also affect churn. AT&T Wireless's ability to compete successfully also will
depend on marketing, and on its ability to anticipate and respond to various
competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services, changes in
consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions and discount
pricing strategies by competitors.

     CONSOLIDATION IN THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT
AT&T WIRELESS.

     The wireless communications industry has been experiencing significant
consolidation and AT&T Wireless expects that this consolidation will continue.
The previously announced mergers or joint ventures of Bell Atlantic
Corporation/GTE Corporation/Vodafone AirTouch, now called Verizon,
SBC/BellSouth, now called Cingular, and Deutsche Telekom/VoiceStream Wireless,
have created large, well-capitalized competitors with substantial financial,
technical, marketing and other resources to respond to AT&T Wireless's
offerings. These mergers or ventures have caused AT&T Wireless's ranking to
decline to third in U.S. revenue and U.S. subscriber share. In terms of U.S.
population covered by licenses, AT&T Wireless, including its partnership and
affiliates, ranks third. As a result, these competitors may be able to offer
nationwide services and plans more quickly and more economically than AT&T
Wireless, to obtain roaming rates that are more favorable than those obtained by
AT&T Wireless, and may be better able to respond to AT&T Wireless's offers.

     SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY COULD MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECT AT&T WIRELESS.

     The wireless communications industry is experiencing significant
technological change. This change includes the increasing pace of digital
upgrades in existing analog wireless systems, evolving industry standards,
ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter
development cycles for new products, enhancements and changes in end-user needs
and preferences and increased importance of data and broadband capabilities. The
pace and extent of customer demand may not continue to increase, and airtime and
monthly recurring charges may continue to decline. As a result, the future
prospects of the industry and of AT&T Wireless and the success of AT&T
Wireless's competitive services remain uncertain. Also, alternative technologies
may develop for the provision of services to customers that may provide wireless
communications service or alternative service superior to that available from
AT&T Wireless. Technological developments may therefore materially adversely
affect AT&T Wireless.

     TERMINATION OR IMPAIRMENT OF AT&T WIRELESS'S RELATIONSHIP WITH A SMALL
NUMBER OF KEY SUPPLIERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REVENUES AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

     AT&T Wireless has developed relationships with a small number of key
vendors, including Nokia Mobile Phones, Inc., Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson,
Mitsubishi Corporation, and Motorola, Inc., for its

supply of wireless handsets, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Nortel Networks, Inc.,
Ericsson and Nokia Networks, Inc. for its supply of telecommunications
infrastructure equipment and Convergys Information Management Group for its
billing services. AT&T Wireless does not have operational or financial control
over its key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in
which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers were
unable to honor their obligations to AT&T Wireless, AT&T Wireless could
experience disruptions of its business and adverse effects on its revenues and
results of operations.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
OR BE COMPATIBLE WITH NEXT GENERATION TECHNOLOGY.

     There are three existing digital transmission technologies, none of which
is compatible with the others. AT&T Wireless selected time division multiple
access technology for its second-generation network because AT&T Wireless
believes that this technology offers several advantages over other second-
generation technologies. However, a number of other wireless service providers
chose code division multiple access or global system for mobile communications
as their digital wireless technology. For AT&T Wireless's path to next
generation technology, it has chosen a global system for mobile communications
platform to make available enhanced data services using general packet radio
service technology, and third-generation capabilities using enhanced data rates
for global evolution and ultimately universal mobile telecommunications systems
technologies. These technologies may not provide the advantages AT&T Wireless
expects. Other wireless providers have chosen a competing wideband technology as
their third-generation technology. If the universal mobile telecommunications
standard does not gain widespread acceptance, it would materially adversely
affect AT&T Wireless's business, financial condition and prospects. As AT&T
Wireless implements its plans for deployment of technology for third-generation
capabilities, it will continue to incur substantial costs associated with
maintaining its time division multiple access networks. Also, these networks are
not compatible, and customers with phones that operate on one network will not
initially be able to use those phones on the other network. There are risks
inherent in the development of new third-generation equipment and AT&T Wireless
may face unforeseen costs, delays or problems that may have a material adverse
effect on the company.

     AT&T WIRELESS RELIES ON FAVORABLE ROAMING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH IT MAY BE
UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN.

     AT&T Wireless may not continue to be able to obtain or maintain roaming
agreements with other providers on terms that are acceptable to it. AT&T
Wireless's customers automatically can access another provider's analog cellular
or digital system only if the other provider allows AT&T Wireless's customers to
roam on its network. AT&T Wireless relies on agreements to provide roaming
capability to its customers in many areas of the United States that its network
does not serve. Some competitors, because of their call volumes or their
affiliations with, or ownership of, wireless providers, however, may be able to
obtain roaming rates that are lower than those rates obtained by AT&T Wireless.
In addition, the quality of service that a wireless provider delivers during a
roaming call may be inferior to the quality of service AT&T Wireless or an
affiliated company provides, the price of a roaming call may not be competitive
with prices of other wireless providers for such call, and AT&T Wireless's
customers may not be able to use any of the advanced features, such as voicemail
notification, that the customer enjoys when making calls within AT&T Wireless's
network. Finally, AT&T Wireless may not be able to obtain favorable roaming
agreements for its third-generation products and services that it intends to
offer using the technologies it plans to deploy for interim enhanced data and
third-generation services.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AND IT DEPENDS ON FOURTH QUARTER
RESULTS, WHICH MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE STRONG.

     The wireless industry, including AT&T Wireless, has experienced a trend of
generating a significantly higher number of customer additions and handset sales
in the fourth quarter of each year as compared to the other three fiscal
quarters. A number of factors contribute to this trend, including the increasing
use of retail distribution, which is dependent upon the year-end holiday
shopping season, the timing of new product and service announcements and
introductions, competitive pricing pressures, and aggressive

marketing and promotions. Strong fourth quarter results for customer additions
and handset sales may not continue for the wireless industry or for AT&T
Wireless. In the future, the number of AT&T Wireless's customer additions and
handset sales in the fourth quarter could decline for a variety of reasons,
including its inability to match or beat pricing plans offered by competitors,
failure to adequately promote its products, services and pricing plans, or
failure to have an adequate supply or selection of handsets. If in any year
fourth quarter results fail to significantly improve upon customer additions and
handset sales from the year's previous quarters, this could adversely impact
AT&T Wireless's results for the following year.

     MEDIA REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED RADIO FREQUENCY EMISSIONS MAY BE LINKED TO
VARIOUS HEALTH CONCERNS AND INTERFERE WITH VARIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES, AND AT&T
WIRELESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL LITIGATION RELATING TO THESE HEALTH
CONCERNS.

     Media and other reports have linked radio frequency emissions from wireless
handsets to various health concerns, including cancer, and to interference with
various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers.
Research and studies are ongoing. Whether or not such research or studies
conclude there is a link between radio frequency emissions and health, these
concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage the use of wireless
handsets or expose AT&T Wireless to potential litigation, which could have a
material adverse effect on AT&T Wireless's results of operations. Several class
action lawsuits have been filed against AT&T Wireless, several other wireless
service operators and several wireless phone manufacturers, asserting products
liability, breach of warranty and other claims relating to radio frequency
transmissions to and from wireless phones. The complaints seek damages for
personal injuries and the costs of headsets for wireless phone users as well as
injunctive relief.

     AT&T WIRELESS'S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT COULD
HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON AT&T WIRELESS'S BUSINESS.

     The licensing, construction, operation, sale, resale and interconnection
arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated to varying degrees
by the FCC, and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory
agencies. These regulations may include, among other things, required service
features and capabilities, such as number portability or emergency 911 service.
In addition, the FCC, together with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration,
regulates tower marking and lighting. Any of these agencies having jurisdiction
over AT&T Wireless's business could adopt regulations or take other actions that
could adversely affect AT&T Wireless's business. FCC licenses to provide
wireless services or personal communications services are subject to renewal and
revocation. There may be competition for AT&T Wireless's licenses upon their
expiration and it is possible that the FCC will not renew them. FCC rules
require all wireless and personal communications services licensees to meet
specified build out requirements. AT&T Wireless may not be able to meet these
requirements in each market. Failure to comply with these requirements in a
given license area could result in revocation or forfeiture of AT&T Wireless's
license for that license area or the imposition of fines on AT&T Wireless by the
FCC.

     AT&T WIRELESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL LITIGATION RELATING TO THE USE OF
WIRELESS PHONES WHILE DRIVING.

     Some studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless phones
while driving may impair drivers' attention in some circumstances, making
accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation
relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, or to new restrictions
or regulations on wireless phone use, any of which also could have material
adverse effects on AT&T Wireless's results of operations.

     STATE AND LOCAL LEGISLATION RESTRICTING OR PROHIBITING WIRELESS PHONE USE
WHILE DRIVING COULD CAUSE SUBSCRIBER USAGE TO DECLINE.

     Some state and local legislative bodies have proposed legislation
restricting or prohibiting the use of wireless phones while driving motor
vehicles. Similar laws have been enacted in other countries. On June 28, 2001,
New York State enacted a law prohibiting the use of handheld wireless phones
while driving motor vehicles other than through the use of hands-free equipment.
To date, a small number of communities in the United States have also passed
restrictive local ordinances. These laws, or if passed,

other laws prohibiting or restricting the use of wireless phones while driving,
could have the effect of reducing subscriber usage, which could cause a material
adverse effect on AT&T Wireless's results of operations.

     AT&T WIRELESS MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO OPERATE AS AN
INDEPENDENT ENTITY AND MAY INCUR GREATER COSTS.

     AT&T Wireless has been part of an integrated telecommunications provider
since its acquisition by AT&T Corp. in 1994. Following the split-off from AT&T
Corp. on July 9, 2001, however, AT&T Corp. has no obligation to provide
financial, operational or organizational assistance to AT&T Wireless other than
limited services. AT&T Wireless may not be able to implement successfully the
changes necessary to operate independently. AT&T Wireless may also incur
additional costs relating to operating independently that would cause its cash
flow and results of operations to decline materially. In addition, although AT&T
Wireless may be able to participate in some of AT&T Corp.'s supplier
arrangements where those arrangements permit or the vendors agree, AT&T
Wireless's supplier arrangements may not be as favorable as has historically
been the case.

     Agreements that AT&T Wireless has entered into in connection with the
split-off provide that its business will be conducted differently and that its
relationship with AT&T Corp. will be different from what it has historically
been prior to the split-off. These differences may have a detrimental effect on
AT&T Wireless's results of operations or financial condition.

     THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AT&T WIRELESS GROUP MAY NOT BE
REPRESENTATIVE OF AT&T WIRELESS'S RESULTS AS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY AND,
THEREFORE, MAY NOT BE RELIABLE AS AN INDICATOR OF AT&T WIRELESS'S HISTORICAL OR
FUTURE RESULTS.

     The historical financial information of AT&T Wireless Group may not reflect
what AT&T Wireless's results of operations, financial position and cash flows
would have been had it been an independent entity during the periods presented.
This is because the financial information reflects allocations for services
provided to AT&T Wireless Group by AT&T Corp., which allocations may not reflect
the costs AT&T Wireless incurs for similar or incremental services as an
independent entity.

     AT&T WIRELESS WILL GENERALLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAX LIABILITY IF THE
SPLIT-OFF IS TAXABLE.

     Under the separation and distribution agreement between AT&T Wireless and
AT&T Corp., subject to limited exceptions, AT&T Wireless will be responsible for
any tax liability and any related liability that results from the split-off
failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction. If the split-off failed to qualify
as a tax-free transaction, this liability would have a material adverse effect
on AT&T Wireless.

     AT&T WIRELESS MAY NO LONGER RECEIVE TAX SHARING PAYMENTS FROM AT&T CORP.
SINCE IT CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE AT&T CORP. CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURN GROUP,
AND AT&T WIRELESS MAY INCUR OTHER TAX LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE SPLIT-OFF
AND PRE-SPLIT-OFF TRANSACTIONS.

     As a result of the split-off, AT&T Wireless ceased to be a member of the
consolidated federal income tax return group of which AT&T Corp. is the common
parent. Consequently, taxable income and losses, and AT&T Wireless's other tax
attributes in post-split-off taxable periods can generally no longer offset
taxable income or losses and other tax attributes of the AT&T Corp. consolidated
tax return group. For two taxable years after the split-off, under U.S. federal
income tax rules, AT&T Wireless would generally be able to carry back any such
tax losses, subject to limitations, against taxable income, if any, of members
of AT&T Wireless Group for pre-split-off periods. Under AT&T Wireless's tax
sharing agreement with AT&T Corp., however, AT&T Wireless generally may only
carry back net operating losses (and not other tax attributes) from
post-split-off taxable periods to pre-split-off taxable periods, and only if
those losses are significant and with the consent of AT&T Corp., which consent
AT&T Corp. has agreed not to withhold unreasonably. To the extent AT&T Wireless
has tax losses in post-split-off taxable periods, it would generally no longer
receive current tax sharing payments with respect to those losses. Instead,
except where those losses can be carried back, AT&T Wireless would benefit from
those losses only if and when it generated sufficient taxable income in future
years to utilize those tax losses on a stand-alone basis.

     In addition, there may be tax costs associated with the split-off that
result from AT&T Wireless's ceasing to be a member of the AT&T Corp.
consolidated tax return group, as well as from pre-split-off transactions. If
incurred, these costs could be material to AT&T Wireless's results.

     VARIOUS FACTORS MAY INTERFERE WITH AT&T WIRELESS'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN
DESIRABLE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND EQUITY ISSUANCES.

     AT&T Wireless may be prevented from engaging in some desirable strategic
transactions. The Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a company which
has undergone a tax-free split-off from particular issuances of shares generally
within a two-year period after the split-off. In addition, the separation and
distribution agreement prohibits AT&T Wireless, for a period of 30 months
following the split-off, from entering into particular transactions that could
render the split-off taxable. This may discourage, delay or prevent a merger,
change of control, or other strategic or capital raising transactions involving
AT&T Wireless's issuance of equity. Provisions of AT&T Wireless's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, rights plan, applicable law
and the DoCoMo agreements may also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or
preventing change of control transactions that AT&T Wireless stockholders find
desirable.

     AT&T WIRELESS MAY LOSE RIGHTS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH AT&T CORP. IF A CHANGE
OF CONTROL OCCURS.

     Some of the agreements that AT&T Wireless has entered into with AT&T Corp.
in connection with the split-off, including the brand license agreement, master
carrier agreement and other commercial agreements, contain provisions that give
one party rights in the event of a change of control of the other party. These
provisions may deter a change of control. In the event of a change of control,
the exercise of these rights could have a material adverse effect on AT&T
Wireless.

     AT&T CORP.'S RESTRUCTURING MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT AT&T WIRELESS'S COMPETITIVE
POSITION.

     In connection with AT&T Corp.'s restructuring, there is a risk that AT&T
Wireless and AT&T Corp.'s other separated business units may not be able to
create effective intercompany agreements to facilitate effective cost sharing or
to maintain or enter into arrangements for combining their respective services
in customer offerings or other forms of bundling arrangements. Competition
between AT&T Wireless and the other AT&T Corp. units in overlapping markets
could result in more downward price pressure. AT&T Wireless expects that the
different businesses and companies will share the AT&T brand after the
restructuring, which will likely increase this level of competition. In
addition, any incremental costs associated with implementing AT&T Corp.'s
restructuring plan may materially adversely affect the different businesses and
companies, including AT&T Wireless's business.

AGREEMENTS WITH TELECORP AND AT&T WIRELESS, MESSRS. VENTO AND SULLIVAN AND OTHER
STOCKHOLDERS OF TELECORP HAVE AGREED TO VOTE ALL OF THEIR SHARES OF TELECORP
CAPITAL STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING POWER OF TELECORP
CAPITAL STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION
OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND AGAINST COMPETING PROPOSALS. ACCORDINGLY,
STOCKHOLDER ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ASSURED.

PROXIES

     All shares of TeleCorp capital stock represented by properly executed
proxies or voting instructions received before or at the TeleCorp special
meeting will, unless the proxies or voting instructions are revoked, be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies or voting
instructions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card
or voting instruction, the shares will be voted "FOR" adoption of the merger
agreement. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to
vote your shares.

     If a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction is returned and the
stockholder has abstained from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the
TeleCorp capital stock represented by the proxy or voting instruction will be
considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum,
but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank,
you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is
returned by a broker or bank holding shares which indicates that the broker or
bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger
agreement, the shares will be considered present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to
have been voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Your broker or
bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
following the information provided to you by your bank or broker.

     TeleCorp does not expect that any matter other than the adoption of the
merger agreement will be brought before its special meeting. If, however, other
matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in
accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority
to do so is withheld on the proxy card.

     A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted
by:

     - notifying in writing the Secretary of TeleCorp at 1010 N. Glebe Road,
       Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22201;

     - granting a subsequently dated proxy; or

     - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder
       of record.

     Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless will equally share the expenses incurred in
connection with the printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus.
TeleCorp will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding
shares of TeleCorp capital stock beneficially owned by others to send this proxy
statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will
reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in doing so. TeleCorp has
also retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to aid in the
solicitation of proxies from TeleCorp stockholders in connection with the
special meeting. Georgeson will receive a fee of approximately $10,500 as
compensation for its services, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. TeleCorp may also use its regular employees, who will not be specially
compensated, to solicit proxies from TeleCorp stockholders, either personally or
by mail, telephone, internet, fax or other means.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A
TRANSMITTAL LETTER WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SURRENDER OF STOCK CERTIFICATES
WILL BE MAILED TO YOU AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     AT&T Wireless participated in the formation of TeleCorp in 1998, and
TeleCorp has been one of AT&T Wireless's business affiliates throughout
TeleCorp's existence. Since TeleCorp's initial public offering in 1999, AT&T
Wireless has periodically reviewed and considered whether to increase its
investment, or seek to consolidate, the wireless communications operations of
the two companies. Similarly, TeleCorp, both before and after its recent
combination with Tritel, has continually reviewed and considered its strategic
alternatives in light of developing trends in the wireless communications
industry, including significant industry consolidation, the availability of
capital to finance network construction and subscriber growth, and its
relationship with AT&T Wireless.

     In late July 2001, Rohit M. Desai, a non-management director of TeleCorp,
contacted William Hague, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development,
Mergers and Acquisitions at AT&T Wireless, to suggest that it might be an
appropriate time for AT&T Wireless to consider making a proposal to acquire the
equity of TeleCorp that AT&T Wireless did not already own. This contact led to a
meeting at which informal discussions were held during the first week of August
between Mr. Hague, Mr. Desai, James M. Hoak, Jr. and Michael R. Hannon, each a
non-management director of TeleCorp, and, separately, with Gerald T. Vento,
chief executive officer and director of TeleCorp, and Thomas H. Sullivan,
executive vice president, chief financial officer and director of TeleCorp. No
specific terms or transactions were proposed in these discussions and, in late
August 2001, Mr. Hague informed Messrs. Vento and Sullivan and several other
TeleCorp directors that AT&T Wireless was not prepared to make an acquisition
proposal at that time.

     On Friday, September 28, 2001, Mr. Hague and Lewis M. Chakrin, Executive
Vice President/Corporate Strategy & Planning of AT&T Wireless, contacted Messrs.
Hannon, Hoak, Sullivan and Vento and indicated that, while AT&T Wireless had not
determined whether to make any proposal, AT&T Wireless would like to discuss the
parameters pursuant to which AT&T Wireless would consider the possibility of
making a proposal to acquire the shares of TeleCorp that AT&T Wireless did not
already own, including possible structures, ranges of prices or exchange ratios,
and timing. In particular, the AT&T Wireless representatives indicated that any
exchange ratio proposal would be unlikely to be above 0.8 of a share of AT&T
Wireless common stock for each share of TeleCorp common stock. Messrs. Hague and
Chakrin also left a telephone message for Mr. Desai to similar effect. While not
agreeing to any particular parameters, the TeleCorp directors agreed that
representatives of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp should meet during the following
week.

     On Monday, October 1, 2001, three non-management directors of TeleCorp,
Messrs. Hannon, Hoak and Desai, and two management directors of TeleCorp,
Messrs. Vento and Sullivan, as well as other TeleCorp senior management, held a
preliminary meeting with Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan (the financial advisors to
TeleCorp), Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft (outside legal counsel to TeleCorp) and
Andrew Hubregsen, a representative of CTIHC, Inc. (the largest TeleCorp
stockholder other than AT&T Wireless), at the offices of JPMorgan in New York
City. At this meeting, TeleCorp's financial advisors presented preliminary
financial analyses relating to TeleCorp, AT&T Wireless and a possible
acquisition of TeleCorp by AT&T Wireless, including information designed to
assist TeleCorp in negotiating a higher exchange ratio than the exchange ratio
then contemplated by AT&T Wireless. Management and its legal and financial
advisors responded to questions posed to them by TeleCorp directors present at
the meeting. TeleCorp board members, management, legal and financial advisors
and the representative of CTIHC then discussed negotiating tactics and possible
transaction parameters in the event that discussions with AT&T Wireless were to
proceed. In addition, the non-management directors and the CTIHC representative
asked Mr. Hannon to participate with the senior management in any discussions
with AT&T Wireless and to keep Messrs. Hoak and Desai and the representative of
CTIHC apprised of any discussions.

     On Tuesday, October 2, 2001, Messrs. Hannon, Vento and Sullivan, and other
TeleCorp senior management and the financial and legal advisors of TeleCorp met
with Messrs. Hague and Chakrin, other

representatives of AT&T Wireless management, and the financial and legal
advisors of AT&T Wireless at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
(outside legal counsel to AT&T Wireless), in New York City. During the course of
the meeting, representatives of AT&T Wireless indicated that they were exploring
the possible interest of AT&T Wireless in acquiring TeleCorp and described the
parameters that they might consider in this regard. In particular, the AT&T
Wireless representatives reiterated their view that any exchange ratio proposal
would be unlikely to be above 0.8 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock for
each share of TeleCorp common stock. AT&T Wireless also indicated that any
possible agreement with it would require stockholders representing a majority of
the TeleCorp voting power to enter into agreements with AT&T Wireless requiring
such stockholders to vote their TeleCorp shares in favor of the transaction and
preventing those holders from selling or transferring their shares for specified
periods of time. AT&T Wireless suggested that in a possible proposal, TeleCorp
series C and E preferred stock (the only series of preferred stock that were not
owned exclusively by subsidiaries of AT&T Wireless) could be converted into AT&T
Wireless common stock at a discount from its liquidation preference, but invited
further discussion on this point. AT&T Wireless also expressed concern that
leaks or rumors concerning a possible transaction could affect the relative
trading prices of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp common stock, which could affect
the ability of the parties to achieve a transaction at an exchange ratio
acceptable to both. As a result, AT&T Wireless indicated that if it were to
proceed with merger discussions, it would terminate discussions if a definitive
merger agreement were not executed before the open of stock market trading on
Monday, October 8, 2001 or if TeleCorp failed to pursue such discussions with
AT&T Wireless on an exclusive basis. Further, AT&T Wireless stated that, as a
stockholder of TeleCorp, AT&T Wireless was not a seller of its TeleCorp shares
and was not prepared to support an alternative transaction between TeleCorp and
a third party and would likely withhold any consent to any such competing
transaction required of AT&T Wireless under the TeleCorp stockholders agreement.

     Discussions continued throughout the day, including as to ranges of
potential exchange ratios and the treatment of the TeleCorp series C and E
preferred stock, with the TeleCorp representatives periodically updating and
receiving guidance from Messrs. Hoak and Desai as well as the representative of
CTIHC. Ultimately, these directors (with the exception of Mr. Desai) reached a
consensus that they would be willing to recommend to the TeleCorp board of
directors a proposal that provided for a common stock exchange ratio of 0.9 and
for the conversion of TeleCorp series C and E preferred shares into
substantially identical AT&T Wireless preferred shares, and also provided
TeleCorp with adequate capital raising flexibility to fund its business plan and
other expenses. That evening, the TeleCorp representatives informed AT&T
Wireless of this consensus. The AT&T Wireless representatives indicated that
they would consider TeleCorp's position, and a meeting was scheduled between
AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp representatives for Wednesday, October 3, 2001.

     Also on Tuesday, October 2, 2001, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp executed a
customary confidentiality agreement permitting the exchange of confidential
information for due diligence purposes.

     Meetings between representatives of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp, including
separate sessions between the respective financial advisors, continued
throughout the morning and afternoon of Wednesday, October 3, 2001. Initially,
AT&T Wireless discussed a range of exchange ratios above that discussed the
previous day, but below the 0.9 exchange ratio suggested by the TeleCorp
representatives. The TeleCorp representatives stated that they would terminate
discussions with respect to any possible transaction that did not provide for an
exchange ratio for the TeleCorp common stock of at least 0.9. At one point, AT&T
Wireless's financial advisor suggested that a collar mechanism could perhaps
bridge the gap between the range of exchange ratios discussed by the AT&T
Wireless representatives and the 0.9 exchange ratio suggested by the TeleCorp
representatives. The TeleCorp representatives did not agree to this suggestion,
and reiterated their position with respect to the common stock exchange ratio.
Later in the day, after internal discussion, the AT&T Wireless representatives
informed the TeleCorp representatives that, subject to the relative trading
ratio of the public stock of the two companies remaining relatively stable, the
representatives would be willing to consider and discuss with the AT&T Wireless
board of directors the possibility of making a proposal that would meet
TeleCorp's requirements for a 0.9 common stock

exchange ratio and conversion of TeleCorp series C and E preferred shares into
substantially identical AT&T Wireless preferred shares and would address
TeleCorp's need for capital raising flexibility.

     Later on Wednesday afternoon, October 3, 2001, Messrs. Hannon, Vento and
Sullivan contacted the remaining members of the TeleCorp board of directors to
inform them of the discussions with AT&T Wireless. A special meeting of the
TeleCorp board of directors was called for Thursday, October 4, 2001.

     Beginning on Thursday, October 4, 2001, and continuing through Sunday,
October 7, 2001, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp and their respective representatives
conducted legal and financial diligence activities in anticipation of a possible
transaction.

     On Thursday, October 4, 2001, TeleCorp held a special meeting of its board
of directors, with some directors attending this meeting by telephone. In
addition to members of the board of directors, the meeting was attended by
TeleCorp senior management; TeleCorp's financial advisors; Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft; Richards Layton & Finger (special Delaware counsel to
TeleCorp); Sullivan & Cromwell (counsel to Mr. Desai) and Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett (counsel to the financial advisors of TeleCorp). As previously
contemplated, Gary Wendt, the chief executive officer of Conseco Inc., the
ultimate parent of CTIHC, was elected to the TeleCorp board of directors. Mr.
Hague, Michael Benson and Ann K. Hall, each of whom were then employees of AT&T
Wireless, left the meeting after Mr. Wendt's election. Thereafter, Messrs. Vento
and Sullivan reviewed the possible proposal with the directors, including the
strategic reasons favoring a transaction with AT&T Wireless, and the principal
expected terms and potential risks and benefits associated with such a
transaction. They also reviewed the strategic and financial alternatives
available to TeleCorp in the absence of such a transaction and the financial
condition and business operations of TeleCorp. TeleCorp's legal advisors
provided an overview of the directors' fiduciary duties in the context of a
possible transaction with AT&T Wireless. TeleCorp's legal advisors then reviewed
for the board of directors the potential interests that each member of the board
of directors might be deemed to have in connection with a possible transaction,
as more fully described in "The Merger -- Interests of Directors and Officers of
TeleCorp in the Merger" and the relationships, if any, of TeleCorp's financial
advisors with either TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless, as more fully described in "The
Merger -- Opinions of TeleCorp's Financial Advisors." Several directors asked
questions of senior management and TeleCorp's legal and financial advisors, and
a lengthy discussion and debate regarding the proposed transaction and its
potential risks and benefits ensued. In particular, the directors discussed (1)
whether TeleCorp should solicit other potential acquirors, (2) the proposed
timing for submitting a possible proposal to the board of directors, (3) AT&T
Wireless's requirement in connection with a possible proposal that it receive a
termination fee should a definitive merger agreement be executed but the merger
not be completed under specified circumstances, (4) whether AT&T Wireless would
agree to a contract provision permitting the TeleCorp board of directors to
terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a
third party, and (5) whether a higher exchange ratio could be negotiated with
AT&T Wireless and, in each case, the directors discussed the risk that AT&T
Wireless would terminate discussions if TeleCorp insisted on any of such
matters. In addition, Mr. Desai suggested the desirability of making the
possible transaction contingent upon receiving the consent of stockholders
representing a majority of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock held by the
general public.

     At the meeting, the TeleCorp board of directors determined that TeleCorp
should pursue further discussions with AT&T Wireless regarding a possible
proposal, but should seek improvements in the terms, including inquiring whether
AT&T Wireless would consider conditioning any proposed transaction on the
receipt of approval of stockholders representing a majority of the TeleCorp
class A voting common stock held by the general public or allowing the TeleCorp
board of directors to have the right to terminate the merger agreement in order
to accept a superior proposal from a third party. The TeleCorp board of
directors also authorized TeleCorp management to execute definitive engagement
agreements with Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan as the financial advisors for
TeleCorp with respect to a possible transaction, which TeleCorp management did.

     On Thursday, October 4, 2001, outside counsel to AT&T Wireless provided
outside counsel to TeleCorp with a form of merger agreement and forms of voting
agreements from which to begin discussions on the type of definitive
documentation that would be appropriate for a transaction should AT&T Wireless
make a proposal and the board of directors of each company decide to pursue such
a proposed transaction.

     Additionally, beginning on Thursday, October 4, 2001, and continuing
throughout the weekend, Messrs. Hannon, Vento and Sullivan, and other TeleCorp
senior management contacted some of the TeleCorp stockholders who are
signatories to the TeleCorp stockholders agreement with regard to the
possibility of amending the stockholders agreement in order to permit
stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of TeleCorp to enter
into voting agreements with AT&T Wireless in the event that AT&T Wireless were
to make a proposal that was approved by the TeleCorp board of directors.

     On Friday, October 5, 2001, Mr. Wendt resigned from the TeleCorp board of
directors for reasons that he indicated were not related to the board's
consideration of the possible proposal from AT&T Wireless.

     Negotiations and discussions between the parties and their respective legal
and financial advisors continued on Friday, October 5, 2001, principally at the
offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. At 5:30 p.m., New York time, AT&T
Wireless held a telephonic meeting of its board of directors at which the
directors received an update and recommendation from the AT&T Wireless senior
management and AT&T Wireless's financial and legal advisors. Following this
meeting, at which AT&T Wireless's management was authorized to proceed with the
discussions, representatives of AT&T Wireless met with TeleCorp's
representatives and made a proposal to acquire TeleCorp in a merger transaction
providing for an exchange ratio of 0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock
for each share of TeleCorp common stock, conversion of TeleCorp series C and E
preferred stock into substantially identical AT&T Wireless preferred stock and
otherwise on the terms set forth in the forms of merger agreement and voting
agreements previously provided by advisors to AT&T Wireless. AT&T Wireless
reiterated that it would withdraw its proposal if a definitive merger agreement
were not executed before the open of stock market trading on Monday, October 8,
2001 or if TeleCorp failed to negotiate with AT&T Wireless on an exclusive
basis.

     Following the proposal on the evening of October 5, 2001, diligence
activities and negotiations continued throughout the weekend, including with
respect to TeleCorp's request for inclusion of a right for TeleCorp to terminate
the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, which AT&T Wireless did not
agree to, and with respect to the amount of the termination fee AT&T Wireless
would receive under some circumstances, which AT&T Wireless agreed to reduce
from the $150 million that was previously requested to $65 million. During these
discussions, the parties also established the exchange ratios for the shares of
the TeleCorp series A, B, D, F and G preferred stock (those series of TeleCorp
preferred stock owned solely by subsidiaries of AT&T Wireless).

     On Sunday, October 7, 2001, the TeleCorp board of directors met for
approximately seven hours to consider and vote upon the proposed transaction. In
addition to the members of the TeleCorp board of directors, the meeting was
attended by members of TeleCorp management, and representatives of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft; Richards Layton & Finger; Wiley, Rein & Fielding LLP (FCC
special counsel to TeleCorp); TeleCorp's financial advisors; Sullivan &
Cromwell; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Messrs. Hague and Benson and Ms. Hall
did not attend the meeting until near the end of the meeting, after all
deliberations, as discussed below.

     During the meeting, Messrs. Vento and Sullivan updated the directors as to
the status of negotiations with AT&T Wireless and reviewed for the directors the
background, strategic rationale and potential benefits and risks of the proposed
transaction, including those discussed under "-- TeleCorp's Reasons for the
Merger" and "Risk Factors -- Risk Factors Relating to the Merger." TeleCorp's
legal advisors made a detailed presentation as to the directors' fiduciary
duties to TeleCorp and its stockholders and conducted a detailed discussion of
the material terms of the merger agreement and the related documents, including
provisions intended to provide TeleCorp with sufficient capital raising
flexibility prior to the expected

completion of the merger, as well as the contractual restrictions of the
TeleCorp stockholders agreement which have the effect of limiting the ability of
TeleCorp to pursue some merger and asset sales transactions without the prior
written consent of a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Wireless. In particular,
TeleCorp's legal advisors reported that AT&T Wireless had insisted that the
merger agreement include provisions limiting the ability of TeleCorp to solicit
or approve offers from other potential buyers and would not agree to condition
the proposed transaction on the consent of stockholders representing a majority
of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock held by the general public or allow
the TeleCorp board of directors to terminate the merger agreement to accept a
superior proposal. They also reported that AT&T Wireless had agreed to lower the
amount of the termination fee it would receive if the merger agreement were
terminated in specified circumstances from $150 million to $65 million. They
also reported that AT&T Wireless had indicated that it was still concerned about
the risk of unauthorized disclosure on the relative trading prices of AT&T
Wireless and TeleCorp public stock and, consequently, it would withdraw its
proposal if a definitive merger agreement were not executed before the open of
stock market trading on Monday, October 8, 2001 or if TeleCorp failed to
negotiate with AT&T Wireless on an exclusive basis. At the meeting, TeleCorp's
legal advisors offered the board members an opportunity to supplement
disclosures regarding and/or ask questions regarding the interests of board
members in the proposed transaction as described for the board of directors at
the previous meeting and the TeleCorp legal advisors also responded to
questions. Finally, the directors were informed that, as required by AT&T
Wireless, holders of a majority of the voting power in TeleCorp had indicated
that if the TeleCorp board of directors were to approve a transaction with AT&T
Wireless, those holders would enter into voting agreements committing them to
vote their shares in favor of the transaction.

     Next, representatives of TeleCorp's financial advisors presented to the
directors a summary of their financial analyses related to the merger.
TeleCorp's financial advisors discussed their views concerning the strategic
rationale of the merger as well as the view that the likelihood of a successful
transaction with an alternative acquirer was low, particularly in light of the
contractual restrictions imposed on TeleCorp by the TeleCorp stockholders
agreement. TeleCorp's financial advisors responded to questions from the board
of directors. In addition, TeleCorp's financial advisors orally delivered their
opinions (which were later confirmed in writing), to the effect that, as of the
date thereof and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations and
qualifications set forth in the applicable opinion,

     - other than with respect to AT&T Wireless, the proposed exchange ratio
       applicable to the TeleCorp class A voting, class C, class D, class E and
       class F common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
       holders of those classes of common stock; and

     - other than with respect to AT&T Wireless, the proposed exchange ratio
       applicable to the TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock was fair, from
       a financial point of view, to the holders of those series of preferred
       stock.

     The financial advisors were not requested to, and did not express opinions
as to the fairness of the transaction for the holders of the voting preference
common stock, all shares of which are held by Messrs. Vento, Sullivan and
Mounger, or the series A, B, D, F or G preferred stock, all shares of which are
wholly owned by subsidiaries of AT&T Wireless.

     After an extensive review and discussion of the proposed merger, the
TeleCorp board of directors, without the participation of Messrs. Hague and
Benson and Ms. Hall, by a vote of five to two, with Messrs. Desai and Mounger
voting against, approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, declared them in the best interests of the TeleCorp stockholders and
resolved to recommend that the TeleCorp stockholders approve the proposed
merger. At the request of the five board members who approved the merger
agreement, in order to ensure that technical requirements contained in
TeleCorp's stockholders agreement were satisfied, the proposed merger was then
approved by the full TeleCorp board of directors, including Messrs. Hague and
Benson and Ms. Hall, by a vote of eight to two, with Messrs. Desai and Mounger
voting against.

     The AT&T Wireless board of directors also met on the afternoon of October
7, 2001. At this meeting, the AT&T Wireless board of directors received updates
from its senior management and legal

and financial advisors, and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
related agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Following the respective board meetings, representatives of TeleCorp and
AT&T Wireless finalized the merger agreement and the related documents, and
stockholders of TeleCorp, including a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Wireless,
executed and delivered an amendment to the TeleCorp stockholders agreement
allowing stockholders to enter into voting agreements in connection with the
merger. Messrs. Vento and Sullivan and CB Capital Investors, L.P., CTIHC, Hoak
Communications Partners and HCP Capital Fund, L.P. executed voting agreements
with TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless pursuant to which they agreed to vote their
TeleCorp stock in favor of the merger and to restrictions on their ability to
transfer their TeleCorp shares. TeleCorp, AT&T Wireless and TL Acquisition Corp.
executed the merger agreement, and, on the morning of Monday, October 8, 2001,
issued a press release to that effect.

TELECORP'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE TELECORP BOARD

     Recommendation of the TeleCorp Board

     The TeleCorp board of directors, by a vote of five to two, with three
directors affiliated with AT&T Wireless not participating, has determined that
the terms of the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of TeleCorp and its stockholders and has approved the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by it.

     ACCORDINGLY, THE TELECORP BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT TELECORP STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
"FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     TeleCorp's Reasons for the Merger

     In light of the developing trends in the telecommunications industry and
consolidation in the wireless PCS market, the TeleCorp board of directors
believes that the merger represents a strategic opportunity to allow the
stockholders of TeleCorp to realize superior long-term returns. The TeleCorp
board of directors believes that, following the merger, the combined company
will have greater financial strength, operational efficiencies and growth
potential than either TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless would have had on its own.

     TeleCorp's board of directors identified a number of potential benefits of
the merger and considered the following material factors supporting the decision
to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Risks associated with Financing and Executing TeleCorp's Transition to
GSM/GPRS.  The TeleCorp board of directors believed that it would be necessary
for TeleCorp to build a GSM/GPRS network if it were to continue its existence as
an independent entity in order to realize the benefits of its relationship with
AT&T Wireless. The board of directors realized that developing and building a
GSM/GPRS network would require a substantial capital expenditure, that
additional funding would be necessary, that the plans and expected expenditures
to complete the network were uncertain and that there could be no guarantee of a
positive return on its investment.

     The board of directors considered the difficulty in raising the funding
necessary to design and build a GSM/GPRS network in light of uncertainties
concerning the ability and willingness of Lucent Technologies Inc. to fulfill
its financing obligations to TeleCorp, the difficulty of obtaining other debt
funding due to market conditions in general, and the difficulty of making a
public equity offering in light of current market conditions in general, as well
as the downward pressure exerted on the price of TeleCorp class A voting common
stock as a result of sales, and possible future sales, of large amounts of stock
by TeleCorp's initial investors seeking liquidity. The directors were also aware
that the credit agreement of Tritel, a TeleCorp subsidiary, would need to be
amended, and considered the likelihood that the terms of such amendment would be
unfavorable.

     The board of directors believed that the financing concerns would be
alleviated by the merger because the combined entity would have a significantly
greater amount of financial resources available and a higher credit rating than
TeleCorp on a stand-alone basis.

     Financial Terms of the Transaction -- Premium Valuation; Continuing
Interest in the Combined Company.  The board of directors considered the
following factors and determined that the merger was financially attractive to
TeleCorp and its stockholders in light of the historical market prices and
volatility of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless stock:

     - the 0.9 exchange ratio would represent a substantial premium to TeleCorp
       stockholders based on the closing prices of TeleCorp class A voting
       common stock and AT&T Wireless common stock during various recent periods
       prior to the announcement of the merger (which premium was equal to
       approximately 45% on the last day of market trading prior to announcement
       of the merger) and a risk existed that if the signing of the merger
       agreement were delayed, the exchange ratios offered in the future, if
       offered at all, would not be as attractive;

     - the TeleCorp board of directors believed that not only the TeleCorp class
       A voting common stock, but also the AT&T Wireless common stock, was
       undervalued by the market and recognized that the holders of TeleCorp
       common stock would receive AT&T Wireless common stock, and not cash, in
       exchange for their TeleCorp shares;

     - the TeleCorp board of directors also recognized that holders of TeleCorp
       common stock would receive AT&T Wireless common stock in exchange for
       their TeleCorp common stock, would therefore obtain a continuing interest
       in the combined company on favorable terms, and would participate in any
       appreciation in the trading price of AT&T Wireless common stock occurring
       after October 7, 2001, the date the merger agreement was signed;

     - the greater liquidity of AT&T Wireless common stock when compared with
       the liquidity of TeleCorp common stock;

     - the expectation that the merger would generally be tax-free for federal
       income tax purposes;

     - the possibility that TeleCorp's stockholders who retain their AT&T
       Wireless shares received in the merger might benefit from an additional
       premium if AT&T Wireless were to be acquired by another company at some
       point in the future, taking into account the potential tax consequences
       to AT&T Wireless should such a transaction occur; and

     - the expectation that, due to AT&T Wireless's superior credit rating, the
       AT&T Wireless series C preferred shares and AT&T Wireless series E
       preferred shares would have greater value than the TeleCorp series C
       preferred shares and TeleCorp series E preferred shares that such shares
       would replace.

     Alternatives to the Merger.  The TeleCorp board of directors considered a
number of strategic alternatives and concluded that the merger represented the
most desirable strategic alternative for TeleCorp, as well as the most
attractive opportunity that was available to TeleCorp and its stockholders.
Specifically, the board of directors considered:

     - the risks of TeleCorp continuing as an independent entity including those
       associated with designing, building and financing a GSM/GPRS network, as
       described above;

     - the current industry, economic and market conditions and trends,
       including the likelihood of continuing consolidation and increased
       competition in the wireless communications industry, and the belief that
       a combined and larger company would be better positioned to succeed by
       taking advantage of economies of scale, its stronger capital structure
       and greater financial resources; and

     - the relatively low likelihood that another merger partner could provide a
       better alternative to TeleCorp and its stockholders based upon the
       existing relationship between AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp, the ability of
       AT&T Wireless to impede a merger between TeleCorp and another entity, the
       fact that TeleCorp's service area was a better fit with AT&T Wireless's
       service area than that

of other wireless service providers and the presentations of TeleCorp's
financial advisors which the TeleCorp board of directors believed indicated a
scarcity of other attractive potential merger partners.

     Relatively Low Integration Risk.  The TeleCorp board of directors
determined that there would be a strong strategic and technological fit between
TeleCorp's and AT&T Wireless's wireless communications business and operations.
In particular, the board of directors noted that the mobile communications
services of each company are based on compatible network platforms using TDMA
technology and that TeleCorp's services are already marketed using AT&T Wireless
co-branding.

     New Opportunities for Growth.  The TeleCorp board of directors believed
that combining the wireless communications business of TeleCorp and AT&T
Wireless will create growth opportunities not available to TeleCorp without the
merger. These include opportunities:

     - to offer seamless services in an expanded area;

     - to accelerate the introduction of next-generation wireless voice and data
       services; and

     - to use AT&T Wireless's greater financial resources to expand the AT&T
       Wireless network.

     Stockholder Support.  The TeleCorp board of directors considered the
support of TeleCorp stockholders for the merger as evidenced by the following:

     - TeleCorp stockholders (other than AT&T Wireless and its subsidiaries)
       owning approximately 42% of the outstanding TeleCorp class A voting
       common stock executed an amendment to the TeleCorp stockholders agreement
       allowing stockholders to enter into the voting agreements described
       below.

     - Holders of TeleCorp common stock representing 61.5% of the voting power
       of TeleCorp stock, and 28.1% of the total TeleCorp class A voting common
       stock outstanding, supported and agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

     Opinion of Financial Advisor.  TeleCorp's financial advisors, Lehman
Brothers and JPMorgan, made detailed presentations and responded to questions of
the TeleCorp board members at both of the special meetings of the TeleCorp board
of directors. The presentations included a description of the financial aspects
of the merger and of the various strategic alternatives available to TeleCorp.
At the October 7, 2001 special meeting of the TeleCorp board of directors, the
financial advisors delivered their oral opinions, which were subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of October 7, 2001, and based on
and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters
set forth in the opinions, that the applicable exchange ratio to be received by
(1) the holders of TeleCorp common stock (other than the voting preference
common stock and other than with respect to AT&T Wireless) is fair, from a
financial point of view, to those stockholders and (2) the holders of TeleCorp
series C and E preferred stock (other than AT&T Wireless) is fair, from a
financial point of view, to those stockholders.

     Likelihood of Completion.  The TeleCorp board of directors believed that
the nature and relatively limited number of conditions to the completion of the
merger, and the ability of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless to fulfill those
conditions, would increase the likelihood that the merger would be completed.

     TeleCorp's board of directors also identified a number of potential risks
of the merger and considered factors unfavorable to the decision to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
following factors and risks:

     - the risk that, because the exchange ratio is fixed, the market value of
       AT&T Wireless common shares to be received in the merger may decrease
       significantly after the date that the merger agreement is executed, and
       the absence of any provision allowing for an adjustment of the exchange
       ratio or termination of the merger agreement in that event;

     - the risk that the anticipated potential benefits from the merger may not
       be fully achieved (see "Risk Factors");

     - the management and employee distraction inherent in integrating two
       companies (see "Risk Factors");

     - the other risks associated with an investment in AT&T Wireless, described
       under "Risk Factors";

     - the risk that the FCC or other regulatory authorities may delay or refuse
       to approve the merger or impose conditions that could adversely affect
       the business or financial condition of the combined company;

     - the limitations imposed by the merger agreement on the conduct of
       TeleCorp's business prior to the merger;

     - the limitations placed on the ability of the TeleCorp board of directors
       by the terms of the merger agreement to respond to possible superior
       third-party proposals to acquire TeleCorp; and

     - the statements, views and concerns expressed by the dissenting directors,
       including the following:

      - those in a letter from Mr. Mounger on October 6, 2001, a day prior to
        the final board meeting to consider the transaction, to the TeleCorp
        board of directors in which Mr. Mounger: (1) expressed his belief that
        (a) he had not been provided with sufficient information to make an
        informed decision concerning the proposed transaction, (b) based on the
        information then in his possession, the proposed transaction may not be
        in the best interests of stockholders and (c) the proposed exchange
        ratio of 0.9 appeared inadequate; (2) expressed his concerns that (a) he
        and the other TeleCorp board members may not have sufficient time to
        evaluate any additional information provided prior to the board meeting
        on October 7, 2001 and, in connection therewith, suggested that the
        October 7th meeting be postponed, (b) in his opinion, Cadwalader,
        Wickersham & Taft and certain of the board members negotiating on behalf
        of TeleCorp may have conflicts with respect to representing TeleCorp in
        negotiating the proposed transaction; (3) inquired as to what actions
        may have been taken by the TeleCorp representatives negotiating the
        proposed transaction to seek other entities that may be interested in
        acquiring TeleCorp and, in connection with the foregoing, Mr. Mounger
        noted the letter agreements, dated November 13, 2000, and amended as of
        December 22, 2000 (see "Interests of TeleCorp Directors and Officers in
        the Merger; Relationships with AT&T Wireless -- AT&T Wireless Right of
        First Refusal to Purchase Shares of TeleCorp Stock"), and (4) stated
        that he had not as of that time determined whether he would vote for or
        against approving the merger agreement;

      - those expressed verbally by Mr. Mounger at the October 7, 2001 board
        meeting including: (1) his belief that the exchange ratio for the common
        stock was not as high as he would like even when considering the
        downward pressure exerted on the price of TeleCorp stock previously
        discussed; (2) his preference, even when considering market and
        financial risks, to delay a transaction with AT&T Wireless because he
        believed that the number of TeleCorp subscribers would increase,
        TeleCorp would improve its financial condition and TeleCorp senior
        management was doing a good job; and (3) his statement that if Messrs.
        Vento and Sullivan were willing to disclose the financial terms of a
        series of equity purchase agreements (see "-- Interests of TeleCorp
        Directors and Officers in the Merger; Relationships with AT&T
        Wireless"), then he might vote in favor of the merger; and

      - those in the following statement read by Mr. Desai at the October 7,
        2001 meeting of the TeleCorp board of directors:

        "I am voting against the proposed transaction with AT&T Wireless because
        I believe that the exchange ratio that has been proposed is inadequate.
        A decision is being taken today to sell Telecorp when its share price
        languishes near an all-time low. Furthermore, I believe that the
        proposed exchange ratio translates into selling the Company below its
        intrinsic value. The Company's own investment bankers have previously
        presented to us an analysis of intrinsic value materially in excess of
        the current offer. The underlying spectrum together with the network and
        subscribers of the Company is worth substantially more than what AT&T
        Wireless is offering. In

        addition, I believe that the combination of Telecorp and AT&T Wireless
        presents significant potential synergies which are not being adequately
        reflected in the exchange ratio to benefit Telecorp's stockholders.

        I also believe that under these circumstances the proposed merger should
        be approved by a majority of the public stockholders of the Company."

     In regard to the investment banker analysis referred to by Mr. Desai
(presented on October 1, 2001), the directors considered that JPMorgan had
informed the TeleCorp board at the board meeting on October 7, 2001 that the
preliminary analysis was neither prepared for the purpose of valuing TeleCorp
nor used by JPMorgan in rendering its fairness opinion with respect to the
exchange ratio. Instead, the analysis was prepared at the request of TeleCorp as
a basis with which to negotiate a higher exchange ratio with AT&T Wireless. The
analysis in question compared the actual trading prices of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock and AT&T Wireless common stock on September 28, 2001 to a
hypothetical intrinsic equity value per share based upon the estimated aggregate
value of subscribers, spectrum, and net property, plant and equipment (less
debt) of each entity. The analysis indicated that the per share prices of both
AT&T Wireless common stock and TeleCorp class A voting common stock were trading
at a discount to their respective hypothetical intrinsic equity value per share
set forth in the analysis.

     TeleCorp's board of directors also considered the following factors:

     - the presentations made by, and discussions with, TeleCorp's senior
       management and representatives of TeleCorp's legal and financial advisors
       regarding the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the
       structure of the merger;

     - the totality of information available to the directors concerning the
       transaction and AT&T Wireless in light of, among other things, the
       extensive presentations and discussions conducted by TeleCorp's legal and
       financial advisors; the fact that, because of the existing relationship
       of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless, management and the directors were familiar
       with AT&T Wireless and the effects of the AT&T Wireless/TeleCorp
       relationships on TeleCorp's business; and the fact that three directors
       directly participated in the negotiations relating to the merger and
       regularly consulted with an additional two directors regarding the terms
       of the transaction;

     - the impact of the merger and the newly-adopted change of control policy
       on the employees of TeleCorp;

     - the interests of TeleCorp directors and officers and the relationships
       with AT&T Wireless described under "-- Interests of TeleCorp Directors
       and Officers in the Merger; Relationships with AT&T Wireless";

     - the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United
       States on the ability of TeleCorp to obtain additional funding and the
       stock prices and businesses of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless;

     - historical information concerning the financial performance and
       condition, business operations and capital of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless
       on a stand-alone and a combined basis; and

     - the relative contributions of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless to the net
       revenues and EBITDA of the combined company.

     The TeleCorp directors who voted in favor of the merger agreement, and
therefore the TeleCorp board of directors, believed that the risks were
outweighed by the potential benefits to be realized by the merger.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
TeleCorp board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes all
material factors considered by the TeleCorp board of directors. In view of the
wide variety of information and factors considered, the board of directors did
not find it practical to, and did not, assign any relative or special weights to
the foregoing factors, and individual directors may have given differing weights
to different factors. In considering the opinions of its financial advisors,
TeleCorp's board of directors considered each of the opinions as a whole and did
not

assign any particular weight to any individual analysis performed by its
financial advisors. TeleCorp's financial advisors did not specify to the board
whether any particular analysis did or did not support the fairness of the
applicable exchange ratio from a financial point of view. The TeleCorp board of
directors approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby in consideration of all of the facts, matters and information brought to
its attention.

AT&T WIRELESS'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     As part of its overall business strategy, AT&T Wireless continually seeks
opportunities to continue the expansion of its domestic network in order to
increase the territory covered by AT&T Wireless's network, add additional
spectrum to AT&T Wireless's network, improve quality, achieve greater
efficiencies, provide consistent features regardless of location and speed
deployment of new and advanced wireless services. In addition, AT&T Wireless
participated in the formation of TeleCorp in 1998, and since TeleCorp's initial
public offering in 1999, AT&T Wireless has periodically reviewed and considered
whether to increase its investment or seek to consolidate the wireless
communications operations of the two companies. AT&T Wireless expects that the
acquisition of TeleCorp's wireless communications business will advance its
strategic objectives, in that the acquisition of TeleCorp will:

     - allow AT&T Wireless to provide AT&T Wireless-branded service to 33
       million additional potential customers in 91 markets, including 16 of the
       100 largest markets and 8 of the 50 largest markets; and

     - enable AT&T Wireless to include TeleCorp's markets in AT&T Wireless's
       planned build out of its next-generation network.

     As a result, AT&T Wireless believes that with the acquisition and
integration of TeleCorp, AT&T Wireless will have greater prospects for growth
and will generate significant opportunities to deliver greater value to AT&T
Wireless stockholders, including TeleCorp stockholders who become AT&T Wireless
stockholders in the merger.

OPINIONS OF TELECORP'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS

  Opinion of Lehman Brothers

     Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to TeleCorp in connection with
the merger and delivered its oral opinions to the TeleCorp board of directors at
the October 7, 2001 meeting of the TeleCorp board of directors, which opinions
were subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of October 7,
2001, and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications
and other matters set forth in the opinions, the applicable exchange ratio to be
received in the merger by (1) the holders (other than AT&T Wireless) of TeleCorp
common stock, other than voting preference common stock, was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such stockholders and (2) the holders (other than
AT&T Wireless) of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such stockholders. Lehman Brothers was not asked to
opine on and its opinions did not extend to the TeleCorp voting preference
common stock or any series of preferred stock other than the series C and E
preferred stock. Accordingly, references to the TeleCorp common stock in the
following summary do not refer to the TeleCorp voting preference common stock.

     The summary of the Lehman Brothers opinions set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinions attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus.
Stockholders are urged to and should read the opinions in their entirety for a
discussion of assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken by Lehman Brothers in rendering its opinions.

     No limitations were imposed by TeleCorp on the scope of Lehman Brothers'
investigation or the procedures to be followed by Lehman Brothers in rendering
its opinions, except that TeleCorp did not authorize Lehman Brothers to solicit,
and Lehman Brothers did not solicit, any indications of interest from any third
party with respect to a purchase of TeleCorp. Lehman Brothers was not requested
to and did not make any recommendation to the TeleCorp board of directors as to
the form or amount of the

consideration to be received by TeleCorp stockholders, which was determined
through arms-length negotiations between the parties. In arriving at its
opinions Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific range of values to TeleCorp
but rather compared the relative value of TeleCorp common stock to the relative
value of AT&T Wireless capital stock using the financial and comparative
analyses described below to determine the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the applicable exchange ratio to be received by the holders of TeleCorp
common stock and TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock other than AT&T
Wireless. The Lehman Brothers opinions are for the use and benefit of the
TeleCorp board of directors and were rendered to the TeleCorp board of directors
in connection with its consideration of the merger. Lehman Brothers was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinions do not address, TeleCorp's underlying
business decision to proceed with or effect the merger. The Lehman Brothers
opinions were provided to the TeleCorp board of directors for its use and
benefit in connection with its consideration of the merger. These opinions were
not intended to be and do not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of
TeleCorp with respect to how any stockholder should vote with respect to the
merger.

     In connection with the preparation and delivery of its opinions to the
TeleCorp board of directors, Lehman Brothers performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses, as described below. The preparation of a fairness
opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial and comparative analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not
readily susceptible to summary description. Furthermore, in arriving at its
opinions, Lehman Brothers did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Lehman
Brothers believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying its opinions. In its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of TeleCorp
and AT&T Wireless. Any estimates or projections contained in these analyses are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth
therein. In addition, analyses relating to the value of a business do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses actually
may be sold.

     In arriving at its opinions, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

     - the merger agreement and specific terms of the merger;

     - publicly available information concerning TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless that
       Lehman Brothers believed to be relevant including, without limitation,
       TeleCorp's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 and
       TeleCorp's and AT&T Wireless's Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended
       March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the businesses,
       operations and prospects of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless furnished to
       Lehman Brothers by TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp common stock, trading histories
       of TeleCorp class A voting common stock and AT&T Wireless common stock
       and a comparison of these trading histories with each other and with
       those of other companies Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock,
       the terms of those series of preferred stock;

     - a comparison of historical financial and operating results and financial
       condition of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless with those of other companies
       that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp common stock, a comparison of the
       financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of other
       transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - third-party research analysts' estimates, valuation analyses and target
       prices for TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless;

     - agreements with respect to the outstanding indebtedness or obligations of
       TeleCorp;

     - information provided to Lehman Brothers by TeleCorp and its legal advisor
       regarding contractual rights of AT&T Wireless with respect to the sale of
       TeleCorp;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp common stock, the relative
       contribution of TeleCorp, on a pro forma basis, to AT&T Wireless
       following completion of the merger; and

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock,
       published reports of internationally recognized credit rating agencies
       relating to TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless.

     In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the respective management
of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless concerning their respective businesses,
operations, assets, financial condition and prospects and undertook such other
studies, analyses and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinions, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for the independent verification of such
information and further relied upon the assurances of the respective members of
management of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless that they were not aware of any facts
or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With
respect to the financial projections provided by TeleCorp, upon advice of
TeleCorp, Lehman Brothers assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of TeleCorp as to the future financial performance of TeleCorp,
and Lehman Brothers reviewed such projections in performing its analysis. Upon
advice of TeleCorp, however, Lehman Brothers assumed that the published earnings
estimates of third-party research analysts are a more reasonable basis upon
which to evaluate the future performance of TeleCorp and that TeleCorp will
perform substantially in accordance with such estimates. Lehman Brothers was not
provided with, and did not have access to, financial projections of AT&T
Wireless prepared by the management of AT&T Wireless. Accordingly, Lehman
Brothers assumed that the published earnings estimates of third-party research
analysts are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial
performance of AT&T Wireless and that AT&T Wireless will perform substantially
in accordance with such estimates. In arriving at its opinions, Lehman Brothers
did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless and did not make or obtain any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless. Upon
advice of TeleCorp and its legal advisors, Lehman Brothers assumed that the
merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore will be tax free to the
holders of TeleCorp common stock and TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock.
Lehman Brothers further assumed (1) that the representations and warranties of
each party contained in the merger agreement and the other agreements executed
in connection with the merger agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under the merger agreement and that all conditions to the completion of the
merger will be satisfied without waiver, (2) that the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be completed as described
in the merger agreement, and (3) that the terms of the series C and E preferred
stock of AT&T Wireless to be issued in the merger upon conversion of TeleCorp
series C and E preferred stock are substantially identical to the terms of the
respective classes of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock. Lehman Brothers
further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the completion of the merger will be obtained without
any adverse effect on TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless or on the contemplated benefits
of the merger. Lehman Brothers' opinions necessarily are based upon market,
economic and other conditions as they existed on, and can be evaluated as of,
the date of the opinions.

     Lehman Brothers expressed no opinion as to the prices at which shares of
AT&T Wireless common stock may trade prior to or following the completion of the
merger and these opinions should not be viewed as providing any assurance that
the market value of the AT&T Wireless common stock to be held by stockholders of
TeleCorp after the merger will be in excess of the market value of the shares of
TeleCorp owned by such stockholders at any time prior to the announcement or
completion of the merger. In addition, with TeleCorp's consent, Lehman Brothers
assumed that shares of the TeleCorp class C, class D, class E and class F common
stock are equivalent in value to shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock
for purposes of rendering its opinion with respect to TeleCorp common stock.

     The following is a summary of the material financial and comparative
analyses performed by Lehman Brothers and presented to the TeleCorp board of
directors. Some analyses include information presented in tabular or graphic
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Lehman
Brothers, the tables and graphs must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables and graphs alone do not constitute a complete description of
the financial analyses.

     MARKET IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO COMPARISON

     Lehman Brothers compared the price levels of AT&T Wireless common stock to
TeleCorp class A voting common stock for specific periods from October 5, 2000
to October 5, 2001. The relative price levels implied an exchange ratio prior to
the AT&T Wireless merger announcement ranging from 0.62 to 1.37 as set forth
below.

     RELATIVE VALUATION DERIVED FROM PUBLIC COMPARABLES ANALYSIS

     Using publicly available information including estimates in published
third-party research reports, Lehman Brothers reviewed and compared particular
financial statistics of TeleCorp with corresponding financial statistics for
selected companies in the personal communications services, or "PCS" industry.
For TeleCorp common stock, Lehman Brothers examined, among other things,
enterprise value as a multiple of total POPs and derived a reference range of
$130 to $200 per POP. Enterprise value is the market valuation of a company's
common stock plus the amount of its outstanding debt less the amount of cash it
has on hand. POPs are the number of persons within TeleCorp's licensed coverage
area. From this analysis, Lehman Brothers derived implied per share values of
TeleCorp common stock from $10.25 to $22.55.

     Using publicly available information, including estimates in published
third-party research reports, Lehman Brothers reviewed and compared particular
financial statistics of AT&T Wireless with corresponding financial statistics
for other cellular and PCS companies. For AT&T Wireless common stock, Lehman
Brothers examined, among other things, consolidated enterprise value as a
multiple of 2002 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, and derived a reference range of 10.0x to 14.0x.
Consolidated enterprise value is the market valuation of a company's common
stock plus the amount of its outstanding debt less the amount of cash it has on
hand less non-consolidated assets. From this analysis, Lehman Brothers derived
implied per share values of AT&T Wireless common stock from $17.45 to $24.07.

     The implied per share values from these analyses in turn implied exchange
ratios ranging from 0.43 to 1.29.

     Because of the inherent differences in the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp and the
comparable companies, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to, and
therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the public
comparables analysis and, accordingly, also made qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the characteristics of the comparable companies
and AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp. In particular, Lehman Brothers considered the
size and desirability of the markets of operation and current levels and
historical rates of growth of TeleCorp, AT&T Wireless and their respective
comparable companies.

     RELATIVE VALUATION BASED ON PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS

     As part of its analysis, Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly available
information regarding the terms and financial characteristics in a number of
transactions involving domestic cellular and PCS companies since 1997 in order
to derive the relative values of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless based on the
multiples paid in these transactions.

     For TeleCorp common stock, Lehman Brothers reviewed the prices paid and
calculated the enterprise value as a multiple of total POPs of each PCS
transaction and determined a reference range of $150 to $210 per POP. From this
analysis, Lehman Brothers derived implied per share values of TeleCorp common
stock from $13.76 to $24.31.

     For AT&T Wireless common stock, Lehman Brothers reviewed the prices paid
and calculated the enterprise value as a multiple of estimated EBITDA in the
year following the announcement of each cellular transaction and determined a
reference range of 11.0x to 14.0x. From this analysis, Lehman Brothers derived
implied per share values of AT&T Wireless common stock from $19.10 to $24.07.

     The relative price levels implied exchange ratios ranging from 0.57 to
1.27.

     Because the reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the
transactions analyzed were specific to each transaction and because of the
inherent differences between the businesses, operations and prospects of the
acquired companies included in the selected transactions, Lehman Brothers
believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the precedent transactions analysis, and accordingly
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of
these transactions and the merger that would affect the acquisition values of
TeleCorp and such acquired companies. In particular, Lehman Brothers considered
the size and desirability of the markets of operation, the strategic fit of the
acquired company, the form of consideration offered and the tax characteristics
of the transaction.

     DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

     Lehman Brothers performed a discounted cash flow analysis of both TeleCorp
and AT&T Wireless for the period commencing on December 31, 2001 and ending on
December 31, 2010, using projections based on an average of the latest publicly
available reports by three equity research analysts:

     - John Bensche from Lehman Brothers, dated August 13, 2001 and August 27,
       2001;

     - Thomas Lee from JPMorgan, dated August 1, 2001 and August 15, 2001; and

     - Cynthia Motz from Credit Suisse First Boston, dated July 13, 2001 and
       September 14, 2001.

     A discounted cash flow analysis is one method used to value businesses and
involves an analysis of the present value of projected cash flows of a business
for a specified number of years into the future and the present value of the
projected value of the business at the end of that period of years, which is
commonly referred to as terminal value.

     The discounted cash flow analysis value per share of TeleCorp common stock
was estimated using weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, discount rates
ranging from 12.0% to 14.0% and terminal multiples of estimated EBITDA for
TeleCorp's fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, ranging from 9.0x to 11.0x. The
analysis yielded implied per share values of TeleCorp common stock of $16.18 to
$26.47.

     The discounted cash flow analysis value per share of AT&T Wireless common
stock was estimated using WACC discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0% and
terminal multiples of estimated EBITDA for AT&T Wireless' fiscal year ending
December 31, 2010, ranging from 8.5x to 10.5x. The analysis yielded implied per
share values of AT&T Wireless common stock of $18.42 to $25.06.

     The relative price levels implied exchange ratios ranging from 0.65 to
1.44.

     CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

     Lehman Brothers conducted a contribution analysis which compared the
current total POPs, the total estimated customers and the projected EBITDA for
the years 2001 - 2005 that TeleCorp is contributing to the combined company
relative to the AT&T Wireless contribution to these items. The projections for
customers and EBITDA were based on an average of equity research estimates
available as of October 5,

2001. By analyzing the relative contributions of each company's operating
statistics, Lehman Brothers derived the following implied exchange ratios:

     Valuation of TeleCorp's Series C and E Preferred Stock.  Lehman Brothers
noted that on a stand-alone basis, TeleCorp's operating companies' senior
subordinated bonds carry a credit rating of B3 and AT&T Wireless has a credit
rating of Baa2/BBB. Upon the completion of the merger, TeleCorp would become a
wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Wireless, and Lehman Brothers believes that the
combined entity will continue to carry the same credit rating as AT&T Wireless.

     Lehman Brothers performed a net present value calculation to estimate the
fair value of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock assuming both TeleCorp's
current credit profile and the combined entity's credit profile in each case
valued at the completion of the merger, which was estimated at April 30, 2002.
Lehman Brothers estimated a discount rate range of 20.25% to 21.75% assuming
TeleCorp's current credit profile and a discount rate range of 9.55% to 10.30%
assuming the combined entity's credit profile.

     Lehman Brothers estimated that the net present value of TeleCorp series C
preferred stock is estimated at $11.9 to $14.9 million under TeleCorp's current
credit profile and $74.6 to $84.8 million under the pro forma combined entity's
credit profile.

     Lehman Brothers estimated that the net present value of TeleCorp series E
preferred stock at $1.2 to $1.5 million under TeleCorp's current credit profile
and $6.2 to $6.9 million under the pro forma combined entity's credit profile.

     GENERAL

     Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
evaluation of businesses and other securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The TeleCorp board of directors
selected Lehman Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity
with TeleCorp in particular and the telecommunications industries in general,
and because its investment banking professionals have substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger.

     As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, TeleCorp
has agreed to pay Lehman Brothers a fee for acting as financial advisor in
connection with the merger, including rendering its opinions. Under the terms of
an engagement letter between Lehman Brothers and TeleCorp, TeleCorp has agreed
to pay Lehman Brothers a fee of $10 million for its financial advisory services
in connection with the merger, a portion of which was payable upon the rendering
of Lehman Brothers' opinions and the remainder of which is contingent upon the
completion of a transaction. In addition, TeleCorp has agreed to reimburse
Lehman Brothers for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the merger and to generally indemnify Lehman Brothers for liabilities that
may arise out of its engagements by TeleCorp and the rendering of its opinions.

     Lehman Brothers is acting as a financial advisor to TeleCorp in connection
with the merger. Lehman Brothers has also performed various investment banking
services for TeleCorp in the past and has received customary fees for such
services. In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively
trade in TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless debt and equity securities for its own
account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities.

  Opinion of JPMorgan

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of September 28, 2001, TeleCorp
retained JPMorgan as its financial advisor and to deliver fairness opinions in
connection with the merger.

     At the meeting of the TeleCorp board of directors on October 7, 2001,
JPMorgan rendered its oral opinions to the TeleCorp board of directors, which
were subsequently confirmed in writing, that, subject to the matters set forth
in the opinions, as of such date, the exchange ratio applicable to TeleCorp
common stock and TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders, other than AT&T Wireless, of
TeleCorp common stock and TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock, respectively.
JPMorgan was not asked to opine on and its opinions did not extend to the voting
preference common stock or any series of preferred stock other than the series C
and E preferred stock. Accordingly, references to the TeleCorp common stock in
the following summary do not refer to the voting preference common stock. No
limitations were imposed by the TeleCorp board of directors upon JPMorgan with
respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its
opinions except that JPMorgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any
expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all
or any part of TeleCorp or any other alternative transaction.

     The summary of the opinions of JPMorgan set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of such opinions, which are attached as Appendix E to this proxy
statement/prospectus. TeleCorp stockholders are urged to, and should, read the
opinions in their entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, the matters
considered and the limits on the review undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its
opinions. JPMorgan's written opinions are addressed to the TeleCorp board of
directors, are directed only to fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio applicable to TeleCorp common stock and TeleCorp series C and E
preferred stock in the merger and do not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of TeleCorp as to how such stockholder should vote at the TeleCorp
special meeting.

     In arriving at its opinions, JPMorgan undertook the following activities:

     - reviewed the merger agreement;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock,
       reviewed the terms of those series of preferred stock;

     - reviewed publicly available business and financial information it deemed
       relevant concerning TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless and the industries in
       which they operate;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp common stock, compared the
       proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available
       financial terms of transactions involving companies JPMorgan deemed
       relevant and the consideration received for those companies;

     - compared the financial and operating performance of TeleCorp and AT&T
       Wireless with publicly available information concerning other companies
       JPMorgan deemed relevant;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp common stock, reviewed the
       current and historical market prices of TeleCorp common stock and AT&T
       Wireless common stock and publicly traded securities of those other
       companies;

     - reviewed internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the
       management of TeleCorp relating to its business;

     - reviewed published earnings estimates, valuation analyses and target
       price estimates of third-party research analysts with respect to the
       future financial performance of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless;

     - reviewed agreements with respect to the outstanding indebtedness or
       obligations of TeleCorp and information provided to JPMorgan by TeleCorp
       and its legal advisor regarding contractual rights of AT&T Wireless with
       respect to the sale of TeleCorp;

     - with respect to its opinion on TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock,
       reviewed published reports of internationally recognized credit rating
       agencies relating to TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless; and

     - performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such
       other information as JPMorgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of its
       opinions.

JPMorgan also held discussions with some members of the management of TeleCorp
and AT&T Wireless with respect to aspects of the merger, the past and current
business operations of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless, the financial condition and
future prospects and operations of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless, the effects of
the merger on the financial condition and future prospects and operations of
TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless, and other matters JPMorgan believed necessary or
appropriate to its inquiry.

     JPMorgan relied upon and assumed, without assuming any responsibility for
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or that was furnished to or discussed with it by TeleCorp
and AT&T Wireless or otherwise reviewed by JPMorgan, and JPMorgan has not
assumed any responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan has not conducted any
valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have any such
valuations or appraisals been provided to JPMorgan. In relying on financial
analyses and forecasts provided to it, JPMorgan has assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of TeleCorp to which such analyses or
forecasts relate. JPMorgan also considered published earnings estimates of third
party research analysts and, with TeleCorp's consent, assumed that the
combination of management guidance, such estimates and JPMorgan's own analysis
provided a more reasonable basis to evaluate the future performance of TeleCorp
than the financial projections prepared by TeleCorp alone. JPMorgan was not
provided with, and did not have access to, financial projections of AT&T
Wireless prepared by the management of AT&T Wireless. Accordingly, JPMorgan
assumed that the published earnings estimates of third party research analysts
were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance
of AT&T Wireless. With TeleCorp's consent, JPMorgan also assumed that shares of
the class C, class D, class E, and class F common stock are equivalent in value
to shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock for purposes of rendering its
opinion with respect to TeleCorp common stock. Upon advice of TeleCorp and its
legal advisors, JPMorgan assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and therefore will be tax free to the holders of TeleCorp common stock and
TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock. For purposes of rendering its opinions
JPMorgan also assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, (1) that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement
and the other related agreements are true and correct, that each party will
perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under
the merger agreement and that all conditions to the completion of the merger
will be satisfied without waiver thereof, (2) with respect to its opinion on
TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock, that the terms of the series C and E
preferred stock of AT&T Wireless to be issued upon conversion of TeleCorp series
C and E preferred stock will be substantially identical to the series C and E
TeleCorp preferred stock and (3) that the merger and other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be completed as described in the
merger agreement. JPMorgan further assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the completion of the
merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless
or on the contemplated benefits of the merger. JPMorgan relied as to all legal
matters relevant to rendering its opinions upon the advice of counsel.

     JPMorgan's opinions are based on economic, market and other conditions as
in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan as of, the date of
such opinions. Subsequent developments may affect the written opinions dated
October 7, 2001 and JPMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or
reaffirm such opinions. JPMorgan's opinions are limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders (other than AT&T Wireless) of TeleCorp
common stock and TeleCorp preferred stock, of the exchange ratio applicable to
TeleCorp common stock and TeleCorp preferred stock in the merger, and JPMorgan
has expressed no opinion as to the underlying decision by TeleCorp to engage in
the merger. JPMorgan has also expressed no opinion herein as to the price at
which shares of TeleCorp

class A voting common stock or AT&T Wireless common stock may trade at any time
prior to or following the completion of the merger.

     JPMorgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of
interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of
TeleCorp or any other alternative transaction. Consequently, no opinion was
expressed as to whether any alternative transaction might produce consideration
for TeleCorp's stockholders in an amount in excess of that contemplated in the
merger.

     In accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan employed
generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinions. The following is
a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan in connection
with providing its opinions. We have presented some of the summaries of
financial analyses in tabular format. In order to understand the financial
analyses used by JPMorgan more fully, you should read the tables together with
the text of each summary. The tables do not constitute a complete description of
JPMorgan's financial analyses.

     CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

     JPMorgan reviewed and analyzed the relative contributions to be made by
TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless to the combined company using the following three
metrics: the mean of 2001, 2002, and 2003 financial projections of revenue,
EBITDA and number of subscribers (based upon third-party equity research analyst
estimates available as of October 5, 2001) and the calculated discounted cash
flow equity values of each of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless on a stand-alone basis
(the basis for calculating such discounted cash flow is indicated below under
the discounted cash flow analysis for each of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless). These
analyses indicated:

     JPMorgan observed that holders of TeleCorp common stock would have a 7%
ownership stake in the combined company, based on the exchange ratios.

     RELATIVE EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS

     JPMorgan compared the average of the ratios of the historical closing
prices of TeleCorp class A voting common stock to the corresponding closing
prices of AT&T Wireless common stock over various periods from October 5, 2000
through October 5, 2001.

     COMPARISON OF PREMIUMS

     JPMorgan compared the implied premium as of October 1, 2001 to be paid by
AT&T Wireless in the merger to the premiums paid in other selected transactions
as of one week prior to announcement:

METRIC                                                        OBSERVED PREMIUMS

  August 31, 2001)..........................................         39%
Median -- selected wireless transactions since 2000.........         30%

     As of October 5, 2001, JPMorgan estimated that the implied price per share
of AT&T Wireless common stock that holders of TeleCorp common stock would
receive in the merger would be $14.51, based on the AT&T Wireless common stock
closing price as of October 5, 2001 of $16.12 and the applicable exchange ratio
of 0.9. JPMorgan observed that this price per share represented a 44.9% premium
over the TeleCorp class A voting common stock October 1, 2001 closing price of
$10.01.

     It should be noted that no company or transaction utilized in the analysis
above is identical to TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless or the merger, respectively.

     VALUATION OF TELECORP

     Public Trading Multiples.  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan
compared selected financial data of TeleCorp with similar data for selected
publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which JPMorgan deemed to be
relevant. For each such company, the growth adjusted 2001 year-end estimated
subscriber multiple was computed. The growth subscriber multiple is the ratio of
adjusted enterprise value to estimated subscribers, normalized for growth over
three and five year periods. JPMorgan selected a range of growth adjusted
subscriber multiples which were then applied to TeleCorp's growth adjusted 2001
estimated subscribers, yielding implied trading values for TeleCorp common stock
ranging between approximately $12 and $15 per share.

     It should be noted that no company utilized in the analysis above is
identical to TeleCorp. In evaluating companies identified by JPMorgan as
comparable to TeleCorp, JPMorgan made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of TeleCorp,
such as the impact of competition on the business of TeleCorp and the industry
generally, industry growth and the absence of any material change in the
financial condition and prospects of TeleCorp or the industry or in the
financial markets in general.

     Selected Transaction Analysis.  JPMorgan reviewed publicly available
financial information related to the multiples implied by the ratio of price
paid to estimated current year-end subscribers and estimated current year-end
licensed POPs for cellular and PCS acquisitions announced since January 1, 2000.
JPMorgan then applied such derived multiples to TeleCorp estimated current
year-end subscribers and estimated current year-end licensed POPs, and arrived
at an estimated range of equity values for TeleCorp common stock of between $10
and $21 per share.

     It should be noted that no company or transaction utilized in the analysis
above is identical to TeleCorp or the merger, respectively.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  JPMorgan conducted a discounted cash flow
analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share
for TeleCorp common stock. JPMorgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows
that TeleCorp is expected to generate during fiscal years 2002 through 2007
(based upon third-party equity research analyst estimates available as of
October 5, 2001, management guidance and JPMorgan's analysis). Unlevered free
cash flows are EBITDA less capital expenditures, changes in working capital and
taxes and before interest charges. JPMorgan also calculated a terminal value of
TeleCorp at the end of 2007 by applying a terminal value EBITDA multiple ranging
from 9.5x to 10.5x. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal
values were then discounted to

present values using a range of discount rates from 13% to 15%, which were
chosen by JPMorgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of
capital of TeleCorp. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the
range of terminal values were then adjusted for TeleCorp's current period
(ending June 30, 2001) excess cash, option exercise proceeds and total debt as
of June 30, 2001. Based on the unlevered free cash flows, the range of terminal
value EBITDA multiples and the range of discount rates indicated above, the
discounted cash flow analysis indicated a range of equity values of between $11
and $16 per share of TeleCorp common stock on a stand-alone basis.

     VALUATION OF AT&T WIRELESS

     Public Trading Multiples.  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan
compared selected financial data of AT&T Wireless with similar data for selected
publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which JPMorgan deemed to be
relevant. For each such company, publicly available financial performance was
measured and estimated 2002 EBITDA and estimated 2001 and 2002 subscriber
multiples were computed. JPMorgan selected the mean and the median value for
each multiple and these multiples were then applied to AT&T Wireless's estimated
2002 EBITDA and estimated 2001 and 2002 subscribers, in each case, based upon
third-party equity research analyst estimates available as of October 5, 2001,
yielding implied trading values for AT&T Wireless common stock ranging between
approximately $12 and $25 per share.

     It should be noted that no company utilized in the analysis above is
identical to AT&T Wireless. In evaluating companies identified by JPMorgan as
comparable to AT&T Wireless, JPMorgan made judgments and assumptions with regard
to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of AT&T
Wireless, such as the impact of competition on the business of AT&T Wireless and
the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material change
in the financial condition and prospects of AT&T Wireless or the industry or in
the financial markets in general.

     Selected Transaction Analysis.  Using publicly available information:

     - JPMorgan examined the multiples implied by the ratio of price per share
       to estimated 2001 EBITDA for cellular transactions over $1 billion
       announced since January 1, 2000. JPMorgan applied a range of multiples
       derived from such analysis to AT&T Wireless's estimated 2001 EBITDA,
       based upon third-party equity research analyst estimates available as of
       October 5, 2001;

     - JPMorgan examined the prices paid by DoCoMo in its acquisition of 16% of
       AT&T Wireless.

     This analysis yielded an estimated range of equity values for AT&T Wireless
common stock of between $19 and $27 per share. It should be noted that no
company or transaction utilized in the analysis above is identical to AT&T
Wireless or the merger, respectively.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  JPMorgan conducted a discounted cash flow
analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share
for AT&T Wireless common stock. JPMorgan calculated the unlevered free cash
flows that AT&T Wireless is expected to generate during fiscal years 2002
through 2007, based upon third-party equity research analyst estimates available
as of October 5, 2001 and JPMorgan's analysis. JPMorgan also calculated a
terminal value of AT&T Wireless at the end of 2007 by applying a terminal value
EBITDA multiple ranging from 8x to 10x. The unlevered free cash flows and the
range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of
discount rates from 10% to 12%, which were chosen by JPMorgan based upon an
analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of AT&T Wireless. The present
value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were
then adjusted for AT&T Wireless' excess cash, option exercise proceeds and total
debt as of June 30, 2001. Based on the unlevered free cash flows, the range of
terminal value EBITDA multiples and the range of discount rates indicated above,
the discounted cash flow analysis indicated a range of equity values of between
$19 and $25 per share of AT&T Wireless common stock on a stand-alone basis.

     VALUATION OF TELECORP'S SERIES C AND E PREFERRED STOCK

     JPMorgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the
economic impact to the holders of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock as a
result of the merger. JPMorgan modeled separately the liquidation preference of
TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock held to maturity. JPMorgan then
discounted to present values the liquidation preferences of TeleCorp series C
and E preferred stock assuming first, a range of discount rates based on
TeleCorp's operating companies' current credit rating, and second, a range of
discount rates based on AT&T Wireless's expected credit rating following the
merger. In both cases, JPMorgan made adjustments to the discount rate to reflect
particular characteristics of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock. JPMorgan
estimated a cost of preferred capital for TeleCorp under its current credit
rating of 20% to 22%. This discount rate considered the current trading levels
of the senior subordinated discount notes at TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel and
incorporated additional premiums based on the extended maturity, additional
subordination, reduced liquidity and lack of covenant protection on TeleCorp
series C and E preferred stock. JPMorgan estimated that AT&T Wireless's cost of
preferred capital following the merger would be in the range of 8% to 12%. This
discount rate considered the expected cost of AT&T Wireless's debt following the
merger as well as its estimated cost of equity.

     The comparison of net present values in the analysis showed that TeleCorp
series C and E preferred stock holders would benefit from a rollover of their
holdings due to the expected improvement in credit rating as a result of the
merger. The net present value increase is shown below:

     GENERAL

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. JPMorgan believes that the summary set forth
above and their analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinions. JPMorgan
based its analyses on assumptions that it deemed reasonable, including
assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and
industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon which JPMorgan
based its analyses are set forth above under the description of each such
analysis. JPMorgan's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results that might be achieved, which values may be higher or
lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan's analyses are not and do not
purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which
businesses actually could be bought or sold.

     As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its affiliates
are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate, corporate
and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to advise TeleCorp and to deliver its
opinions to the TeleCorp board of directors with respect to the merger on the
basis of such experience and its familiarity with TeleCorp.

     As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, TeleCorp
has agreed to pay JPMorgan a fee for acting as financial advisor in connection
with the merger, including rendering its opinions. Under the terms of the
engagement letter, TeleCorp has agreed to pay JPMorgan a fee of $10 million for
its financial advisory services in connection with the merger, a portion of
which was payable upon the rendering of JP Morgan's opinions and the remainder
of which is contingent upon the completion of a transaction. In addition,
TeleCorp has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan for its expenses incurred in
connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
and will generally

indemnify JPMorgan against liabilities, including liabilities arising under U.S.
federal securities laws. In the ordinary course of their businesses, JPMorgan
and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or senior
loans of TeleCorp or AT&T Wireless for their own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in
such securities or loans.

     JPMorgan and its affiliates, in the ordinary course of business, provide,
for customary compensation, commercial and investment banking services to
TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless and their respective affiliates and in that regard
JPMorgan's affiliate, The Chase Manhattan Bank, currently acts as agent and bank
under the respective bank credit facilities of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless. An
affiliate of JPMorgan owns approximately 7.3% of TeleCorp's capital stock,
consisting of 15,265,692 shares of class A voting common stock, 27,489 shares of
class C common stock, 199,522 shares of class D common stock and 49,411.14
shares of series C preferred stock, and Michael R. Hannon, a partner of that
affiliate, is a member of the TeleCorp board of directors.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock that exchange their TeleCorp class A voting common stock for
AT&T Wireless common stock in the merger. This discussion addresses only those
TeleCorp stockholders that hold their TeleCorp class A voting common stock as a
capital asset, and does not address all the U.S. federal income tax consequences
that may be relevant to particular TeleCorp stockholders in light of their
individual circumstances or to TeleCorp stockholders that are subject to special
rules, such as:

     - financial institutions;

     - mutual funds;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

     - traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
       accounting;

     - foreign holders;

     - persons that hold their shares as a hedge against currency risk or as
       part of a straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction; or

     - holders that acquired their shares upon the exercise of TeleCorp stock
       options or otherwise as compensation.

     The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. It
is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws, regulations, rulings and
decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus, all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences
under U.S. state and local and foreign laws and U.S. federal laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws are not addressed.

     Holders of TeleCorp class A voting common stock are strongly urged to
consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the
merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state and local
and foreign income and other tax laws in their particular circumstances.

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp have structured the merger so that it is
anticipated that the merger will be a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. It is a condition to the completion of the merger that (1) TeleCorp
receive a written opinion from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, counsel to
TeleCorp, dated the date of completion of the merger, to the effect that for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (2) AT&T
Wireless receive a written opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel
to

AT&T Wireless, dated the date of completion of the merger, to the effect that
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The opinions will be based on customary assumptions, including an
assumption regarding the completion of the merger in the manner contemplated by
the merger agreement, and customary representations made by, among others,
TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless, including representations contained in certificates
of officers of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless. An opinion of counsel represents
counsel's best legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service
or any court. No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal Revenue
Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

  Holders Whose Merger Consideration Consists Solely of AT&T Wireless Common
Stock

     Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, holders of TeleCorp class A voting
common stock that exchange their TeleCorp class A voting common stock solely for
AT&T Wireless common stock in the merger will not recognize gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash, if any, they
receive in lieu of a fractional share of AT&T Wireless common stock. Each
holder's aggregate tax basis in the AT&T Wireless common stock received in the
merger will be the same as that holder's aggregate tax basis in the TeleCorp
class A voting common stock surrendered in the merger, decreased by the amount
of any tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest for which cash is
received. The holding period of the AT&T Wireless common stock received in the
merger by a holder of TeleCorp class A voting common stock will include the
holding period of TeleCorp class A voting common stock that the holder
surrendered in the merger.

     A holder of TeleCorp class A voting common stock that receives cash in lieu
of a fractional share of AT&T Wireless common stock will recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and that holder's
tax basis in the AT&T Wireless common stock that is allocable to the fractional
share of AT&T Wireless common stock. That gain or loss generally will constitute
capital gain or loss. In the case of an individual stockholder, any such capital
gain generally will be long term capital gain if the individual has held his or
her TeleCorp class A voting common stock for more than 12 months on the date of
the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for
both individuals and corporations.

     Under the Internal Revenue Code, an individual holder of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock may be subject, under particular circumstances, to backup
withholding at a rate equal to the fourth lowest ordinary income tax rate
applicable to unmarried individuals (30.5% from August 7, 2001 and 30% from
January 1, 2002) with respect to the amount of cash, if any, received in the
merger, including cash in lieu of fractional shares unless the holder provides
proof of an applicable exemption or provides a correct taxpayer identification
number on Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or a substitute Form W-9 and
otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is not additional
tax and may be refunded or credited against the holder's federal income tax
liability, so long as the required information is furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     In accordance with recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as well as the new
accounting and reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles, AT&T
Wireless will use the purchase method of accounting for a business combination
to account for the merger. Under these methods of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of TeleCorp, including all intangible assets, will be recorded at
their respective fair values. All intangible assets will be amortized over their
estimated useful lives with the exception of goodwill and any other intangibles
with indefinite lives. The financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of TeleCorp will be included in AT&T Wireless's financial statements
prospectively as of the completion of the merger.

CONSENTS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Antitrust Authorities.  As a condition to the merger and under law, AT&T
Wireless and TeleCorp were required to observe the notification and waiting
period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The HSR Act
provides for an initial 30-calendar-day waiting period following the filing with
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice of notification and report forms by the parties to the
merger.

     On October 23, 2001 and October 24, 2001, respectively, AT&T Wireless and
TeleCorp filed the Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division for review in connection with the merger. The associated initial 30-day
waiting period was scheduled to expire on November 23, 2001. AT&T Wireless and
TeleCorp sought early termination of the applicable waiting periods. On November
19, 2001, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp received notification that early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act was granted.

     Although the waiting periods are terminated, at any time before or after
the completion of the merger, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or others could
take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the merger, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking the divestiture by
AT&T Wireless of all or part of the shares or assets of TeleCorp, or of other
business conducted by AT&T Wireless, or seeking to subject AT&T Wireless or
TeleCorp to operating conditions, before or after the merger is completed. There
can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if
such a challenge is made, AT&T Wireless will prevail.

     Federal Communications Commission.  In addition, as a condition to the
merger and under law, AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp are required to obtain
approvals from the FCC. On October 19, 2001 and October 22, 2001, respectively,
AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp filed the required applications with the FCC, seeking
approval of the transfer of control to AT&T Wireless of the FCC radio and
international operating licenses and authorizations held by TeleCorp
subsidiaries. In addition, on October 19, 2001 and October 22, 2001, TeleCorp
filed applications for consent to assign some of its licenses to a third party,
as required in connection with the merger. The applications were listed on an
FCC Public Notice on November 8, 2001. Interested parties may file comments
regarding or petitions to deny the applications until December 10, 2001. Should
comments or petitions be submitted, TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless will have the
opportunity to file oppositions in response by December 20, 2001. The entities
that filed the original comments or petitions will have until December 28, 2001
to file responses to the oppositions. The responses are the final pleadings that
may be submitted.

     Completion of the merger is conditioned, among other factors, upon grants
of the requisite FCC consents becoming final. A "final" FCC order is one that
has not been stayed and is no longer subject to review by the FCC or the courts
because the statutory period for seeking such review has expired without any
request for review or stay pending. Following grant by the staff of the FCC of
the applications for consent to transfer control, there may be post-grant
challenges by private parties or actions by the full FCC or the courts that
would delay or prevent finality.

     While we can make no assurances, we currently anticipate receiving all
necessary FCC clearances during the first half of 2002.

LISTING OF THE AT&T WIRELESS SHARES ON THE NYSE

     AT&T Wireless common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "AWE",
and it is a condition to the merger that the AT&T Wireless common stock that is
to be issued in the merger be listed for trading on the NYSE.

RESALE OF AT&T WIRELESS SHARES ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     Shares of AT&T Wireless capital stock received in the merger by TeleCorp
stockholders generally will be freely transferable, except that:

     - AT&T Wireless shares received by persons who are deemed to be affiliates
       of TeleCorp under the Securities Act of 1933 at the time of the special
       meeting may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by Rule 145
       under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
       Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of TeleCorp for these
       purposes generally include individuals or entities that control, are
       controlled by, or are under common control with, TeleCorp, and include
       TeleCorp's directors and executive officers. The merger agreement
       requires TeleCorp to use all reasonable efforts to cause each of its
       affiliates to deliver to AT&T Wireless on or prior to the tenth day prior
       to the completion of the merger a signed agreement to the effect that the
       affiliate will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any AT&T Wireless
       shares issued to the affiliate in the merger in violation of the
       Securities Act or the related SEC rules; and

     - some of the stockholders who have entered into the voting agreements with
       AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp will be subject to resale restrictions on
       their TeleCorp shares prior to the completion of the merger, as described
       under "Other Agreements -- Voting Agreements."

INTERESTS OF TELECORP DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER; RELATIONSHIPS WITH
AT&T WIRELESS

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of TeleCorp to
vote for the merger, stockholders of TeleCorp should be aware that members of
the TeleCorp board of directors and members of TeleCorp's management team may
have interests in the merger or relationships with AT&T Wireless that may differ
from, or be in addition to, those of other TeleCorp stockholders. The TeleCorp
board of directors was aware of these interests and relationships during its
deliberations of the merits of the merger and in determining to recommend to the
stockholders of TeleCorp that they vote for the merger.

     INTERESTS OF TELECORP DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     TeleCorp Employee Stock Options and Restricted Shares.  Under the terms of
the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger, each TeleCorp employee
stock option outstanding at the time of the merger will be converted into an
option to acquire a number of shares of AT&T Wireless common stock equal to the
number of shares of TeleCorp stock subject to the option immediately before the
completion of the merger times 0.9, rounded to the nearest whole share. The
exercise price for the converted options will be the exercise price for the
corresponding TeleCorp employee stock option immediately before completion of
the merger divided by 0.9. The converted employee stock options will otherwise
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as immediately prior to
the completion of the merger.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, TeleCorp has the right to grant to
its employees additional options to purchase TeleCorp common stock at a per
share exercise price equal to the fair market value of TeleCorp common stock on
the date of grant. These grants must be consistent with grants made under the
TeleCorp option plans during the 12-month period ending October 5, 2001. In any
case, TeleCorp may not grant any options such that there are outstanding options
to purchase more than 13,278,252 shares of TeleCorp common stock, assuming that
no options are exercised between signing of the merger agreement and completion
of the merger. None of the options that are granted under the merger agreement
as described above will vest upon completion of the merger, unless they vest as
a result of a qualifying termination of the optionee's employment under the
severance policy, as described below.

     After completion of the merger, all shares reserved for issuance under the
TeleCorp stock option and restricted stock plans will be issued as shares of
AT&T Wireless stock rather than as shares of TeleCorp stock.

     For example, if the merger occurs on March 31, 2002, based on particular
assumptions and current information, options to purchase 152,318 shares of
TeleCorp class A voting common stock held by

Mr. O'Connor will be converted into options to purchase 137,086 shares of AT&T
Wireless common stock.

     TeleCorp PCS, Inc. (f/k/a TeleCorp Wireless Inc.) 1998 Restricted Stock
Plan.  On November 13, 2000, TeleCorp assumed the obligations of TeleCorp
Wireless under a 1998 Restricted Stock Plan. The plan originally authorized the
issuance of 7,085.22 shares of TeleCorp Wireless series E preferred stock and
12,955.33 shares of TeleCorp Wireless class A voting common stock. As a result
of a stock split occurring in August 1999 and a stock split occurring in
connection with the initial public offering of TeleCorp Wireless, which together
resulted in a 309 to 1 split of the TeleCorp Wireless class A voting common
stock, the number of shares of class A voting common stock issuable under the
plan was increased to 4,003,196.97. The shares of the series E preferred stock
and the class A voting common stock authorized to be issued under the plan were
converted into an equal number of shares of TeleCorp series E preferred stock
and class A voting common stock, respectively, in connection with the
acquisition of Tritel by TeleCorp on November 13, 2000.

     Upon completion of the merger, AT&T Wireless will assume all of TeleCorp's
obligations under the plan, and each restricted share of TeleCorp class A voting
common stock will be converted into 0.9 of a restricted share of AT&T Wireless
common stock. In addition, the restricted shares of the TeleCorp series E
preferred stock will be converted into restricted shares of a substantially
identical series of AT&T Wireless preferred stock.

     Any of the stock not granted in accordance with the terms of the plan by
July 17, 2003 will be awarded to Messrs. Vento and Sullivan on a pro rata basis.
As of October 4, 2001, 6,435.46 shares of TeleCorp series E preferred stock and
3,641,453 shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock have been granted and
remain outstanding under the plan.

     If the merger occurs on March 31, 2002, based on particular assumptions and
current information, 218,765 shares of restricted TeleCorp class A voting common
stock awarded to Mr. O'Connor and 1,601,279 shares of restricted TeleCorp class
A voting common stock awarded to Ms. Dobson will be converted into 196,889
shares and 1,441,151 shares of restricted AT&T Wireless common stock,
respectively. In addition, 255.59 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E
preferred stock held by Mr. O'Connor and 3,120.03 shares of restricted TeleCorp
series E preferred stock awarded to Ms. Dobson will each be converted into an
equal number of shares of restricted AT&T Wireless preferred stock.

     TeleCorp Tracking, Voting Preference Common and Preferred Stock Holdings of
Directors and Officers of TeleCorp.  The chart below lists the holdings of
TeleCorp class C, D, E and F common stock, voting preference common stock and
series A convertible, B, C, D, E, F and G preferred stock of current TeleCorp
board members, former TeleCorp board members, entities related to the current
and former board members and executive officers of TeleCorp as of October 4,
2001. We refer to the TeleCorp class C, D, E and F common stock as the tracking
common stock.

 * The individual no longer serves as a director of TeleCorp but did serve as a
   director of TeleCorp since the beginning of TeleCorp's last fiscal year. The
   individual did not participate in the deliberations on

   whether to approve the merger agreement or to recommend the transactions
   contemplated by the merger agreement to the TeleCorp stockholders.

** Mr. Desai resigned from the TeleCorp board of directors on November 28, 2001.

     Letter Agreement among Gerald T. Vento, Thomas H. Sullivan and
TeleCorp.  TeleCorp entered into a letter agreement on October 8, 2001 with
Messrs. Vento and Sullivan, each as an individual and as an owner and officer of
TeleCorp Management Corp. Inc., through which they currently provide management
services to TeleCorp.

     Under the terms of the letter agreement, TeleCorp agreed to pay TeleCorp
Management Corp. a retention award in exchange for specified services and the
promise that each of Messrs. Vento and Sullivan and TeleCorp Management Corp.
will enter into non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with TeleCorp
and AT&T Wireless at or prior to the completion of the merger. The retention
award consists of a cash lump-sum payment equal to three times the sum of (1)
the "management fees" that TeleCorp Management Corp. receives under the TeleCorp
management agreement and (2) the highest annual bonus earned for the last three
full fiscal years prior to the completion of the merger, if:

     - TeleCorp Management Corp. provides its services to TeleCorp through the
       completion of the merger;

     - the management agreement is terminated by TeleCorp for any reason other
       than "cause;"

     - the management agreement is terminated by TeleCorp Management Corp. for
       "good reason;" or

     - either of Mr. Vento or Mr. Sullivan dies or becomes disabled prior to the
       completion of the merger.

     In the event that either of Mr. Sullivan or Mr. Vento or the management
agreement is terminated for any reason other than those set forth above, Messrs.
Sullivan and Vento will not be entitled to a retention award.

     Messrs. Vento and Sullivan agreed to waive any right to terminate the
management agreement that might arise as a result of the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

     In addition, all parties agreed to terminate the management agreement upon
the completion of the merger, except that the following provisions of the
management agreement will survive the termination of the agreement:

     - TeleCorp Management Corp. will not be liable for any failure or delay in
       its performance, unless the failure is a result of its gross negligence
       or willful misconduct;

     - TeleCorp Management Corp. will not be liable for damages to TeleCorp or
       its subscribers due to any failure of system or performance;

     - neither Mr. Vento nor Mr. Sullivan will be liable for his failure to use
       good faith efforts to cause the other to perform all of his obligations
       under the management agreement;

     - if either Mr. Vento or Mr. Sullivan is threatened to be made a party in a
       legal proceeding because of his status as a TeleCorp employee, he shall
       be indemnified by TeleCorp to the fullest extent permitted by law; and

     - both Messrs. Vento and Sullivan will be eligible for reimbursements for
       out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to the termination of the
       management agreement.

     Under the management agreement, some restricted shares of TeleCorp capital
stock granted to Messrs. Vento and Sullivan immediately vest, and cease to be
subject to repurchase by TeleCorp, upon a termination of the management
agreement by TeleCorp Management Corp. due to, among other events, the removal
of Messrs. Vento and Sullivan as directors of TeleCorp or from their respective
offices of TeleCorp or the diminishment of their responsibilities. The shares
will also vest if the management agreement is terminated by TeleCorp for reasons
other than "cause."

     The letter agreement will be void and have no further force or effect if
the merger agreement is terminated.

     If the merger were to be completed on March 31, 2002, and the management
agreement is terminated under the letter agreement on the same date, the cash
amount payable to TeleCorp Management Corp., based on particular assumptions and
currently available information, would be approximately $3,300,000. In addition,
approximately 1,183,080 shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock and
approximately 1,873 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E preferred stock
awarded to Mr. Vento would vest and no longer be subject to repurchase by
TeleCorp and approximately 735,407 shares of TeleCorp class A voting common
stock and approximately 1,164 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E preferred
stock awarded to Mr. Sullivan would vest and no longer be subject to repurchase
by TeleCorp.

     Change of Control Severance Policy.  On October 7, 2001, TeleCorp adopted
the TeleCorp change of control severance policy which was subsequently modified
effective November 14, 2001, subject to ratification by the TeleCorp board of
directors. The modified severance policy separates participants into three
tiers, Tier I, Tier II and Tier III. Both Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Dobson are Tier I
participants. Participants in this severance policy are entitled to separation
benefits if, prior to the first anniversary of a change of control, such as the
merger, the participant's employment with TeleCorp or its successor is
terminated:

     - by TeleCorp or its successors or affiliates, as applicable, other than
       (1) for "cause," (2) by reason of the participant's death or (3) by
       reason of the participant's disability; or

     - by the participant within 90 days following an event constituting "good
       reason."

     Upon a qualifying termination, but subject to the participant's execution
and non-revocation of a release, a non-competition covenant and a
non-solicitation covenant, a participant will receive a lump-sum cash payment
equal to the sum of:

     - two, in the case of a Tier I participant, one, in the case of a Tier II
       participant, and one-half, in the case of a Tier III participant times
       the sum of (1) the higher of the participant's annual base salary as in
       effect immediately prior to the change of control or the participant's
       highest annual base salary in effect at any time subsequent to the change
       of control and (2) the participant's target bonus for the fiscal year in
       which the participant's employment is terminated;

     - a pro rata bonus through the date of termination for the year in which
       the participant's termination of employment occurs;

     - the participant's accrued but unpaid base salary; and

     - any accrued but unpaid vacation pay.

     In addition, for a period of two years following the qualifying termination
in the case of a Tier I participant, one year following the qualifying
termination in the case of a Tier II participant, and six months following the
qualifying termination in the case of a Tier III participant, the participant
and the participant's dependents will continue to be provided with medical and
life insurance benefits equivalent to those that the participant and the
participant's dependents received immediately prior to the change of control or
such medical and life insurance benefits provided to active senior executives of
TeleCorp until the participant becomes reemployed with another employer and is
eligible to receive medical or life insurance benefits, and so long as the
participant continues to make the required plan contributions.

     Upon a qualifying termination, all equity-based compensation awards held by
a participant will vest in full and become immediately exercisable.

     In the event that any amounts payable or benefits provided under the
severance policy or any other arrangement would otherwise be subjected to the
golden parachute excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code, amounts payable under the policy will be reduced to the maximum amount
permissible to avoid imposition of such taxes.

     Any successor of TeleCorp, its assets or its businesses, will be bound by
the terms of this severance policy in the same manner and to the same extent
that TeleCorp would be obligated to perform its duties if no succession had
taken place.

     The amounts payable under the terms of this severance policy will be
reduced by other severance benefits payable under any plan, program, policy,
practice, agreement or arrangement between the participant and TeleCorp.

     For example, if the merger were to be completed on March 31, 2002 and Mr.
O'Connor's and Ms. Dobson's employment were immediately terminated in a
qualifying termination on that date, the cash amount payable to Mr. O'Connor and
Ms. Dobson under this severance policy, based upon particular assumptions and
currently available information, would be approximately $1,060,000 and $780,000,
respectively. In addition, approximately 141,579 shares of restricted TeleCorp
class A voting common stock, 153.35 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E
preferred stock and options to purchase 132,795 shares of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock awarded to Mr. O'Connor, and approximately 720,576 shares of
restricted TeleCorp class A voting common stock and approximately 1,404 shares
of restricted TeleCorp series E preferred stock awarded to Ms. Dobson, would
vest. The foregoing dollar, option and share amounts are calculated without
regard to the employment agreements of Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Dobson. The
foregoing benefits to be received by Ms. Dobson upon a qualifying termination
will be reduced by any benefits received under her employment agreement due to
her termination. The foregoing benefits to be received by Mr. O'Connor will be
reduced by any benefits received by Mr. O'Connor pursuant to his employment
agreement upon completion of the merger. In addition, the foregoing benefits
were calculated without regard to any reduction that may be required to avoid
imposition of the golden parachute excise taxes under the terms of the modified
change of control severance policy.

     Employment Agreement with Julie Dobson.  On February 28, 2000, TeleCorp
Wireless entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Dobson, under which Ms.
Dobson serves as TeleCorp Wireless's Chief Operating Officer. Under the terms of
the agreement, Ms. Dobson receives an annual base salary of $250,000 with an
annual bonus opportunity based upon the achievement of performance-based
objectives established by TeleCorp Wireless.

     In the event that Ms. Dobson's employment with TeleCorp Wireless is
terminated by TeleCorp Wireless without "cause," Ms. Dobson will receive any
accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination of her
employment, 12 months of her then-current annual base salary, payable in normal
intervals, and for a period of 12 months following the date of termination of
her employment, continuation of the same or equivalent hospital, medical and
dental coverage as Ms. Dobson received immediately prior to such termination. In
addition, if Ms. Dobson's employment with TeleCorp Wireless is terminated by
TeleCorp Wireless without "cause" or by Ms. Dobson for "good reason," any shares
of TeleCorp stock or options to purchase TeleCorp stock granted to Ms. Dobson
under any TeleCorp or TeleCorp Wireless stock or option plan that have not
previously vested will immediately vest on the date of termination of her
employment.

     For purposes of the employment agreement, "good reason" means (1) Ms.
Dobson's demotion or removal from her position, (2) the material diminution of
Ms. Dobson's responsibilities, duties or status without cure or (3) the
relocation of the principal offices of TeleCorp Wireless, without Ms. Dobson's
consent, to a location more than 50 miles from its current location.

     For example, if the merger were to be completed on March 31, 2002 and Ms.
Dobson's employment was terminated on that date without cause, based upon
particular assumptions and currently available information, approximately
720,576 shares of restricted TeleCorp class A voting common stock and
approximately 1,404 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E preferred stock
awarded to Ms. Dobson would vest.

     Employment Agreement with Michael O'Connor.  On October 7, 2001, TeleCorp
Communications executed an amendment to Mr. O'Connor's employment agreement that
becomes effective immediately prior to the completion of the merger. Under the
terms of Mr. O'Connor's amended agreement,

Mr. O'Connor is paid an annual base salary of $190,000 and is eligible for an
annual bonus opportunity of up to 50% of his annual base salary. If Mr.
O'Connor's employment is terminated under the agreement other than for "cause,"
Mr. O'Connor will be entitled to receive any stock options that are vested as of
the termination date, and for a period of 24 months following the date of
termination, will continue to receive the same or equivalent hospital, medical
and dental coverage as he received immediately prior to the termination. In
addition, if Mr. O'Connor's employment with TeleCorp Communications is
terminated by TeleCorp Communications without "cause" or by Mr. O'Connor for
"good reason," or if a "change of control" occurs (without regard to whether Mr.
O'Connor's employment is terminated), subject to Mr. O'Connor's compliance with
a covenant not to compete and a covenant not to solicit employees of TeleCorp
during Mr. O'Connor's employment with TeleCorp and for one year following the
date of termination of Mr. O'Connor's employment, Mr. O'Connor will be entitled
to:

     - a lump sum payment equal to any accrued but unpaid compensation;

     - an amount equal to two times the sum of Mr. O'Connor's base salary and
       his target bonus for the year in which Mr. O'Connor's employment is
       terminated; and

     - vesting of, and lapse of restrictions on, any stock options and
       restricted stock.

     For the purposes of the employment agreement, "good reason" means (1) Mr.
O'Connor's demotion or removal from his position, (2) the material diminution of
any of his responsibilities, duties or status, without cure, and (3) relocation
of the principal offices of TeleCorp Communications, without Mr. O'Connor's
consent, to a location that is more than 50 miles from its current location.

     If the amendment becomes effective, the merger will constitute a change of
control for purposes of the employment agreement.

     The amendment to Mr. O'Connor's employment agreement will be void and have
no further force or effect if the merger agreement is terminated.

     For example, if the merger were to be completed on March 31, 2002, under
the employment agreement, based upon particular assumptions and currently
available information, the cash amount payable to Mr. O'Connor would be
approximately $1,040,000 and approximately 141,579 shares of restricted TeleCorp
class A voting common stock, 153.35 shares of restricted TeleCorp series E
preferred stock and options to purchase 132,795 shares of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock awarded to Mr. O'Connor would vest.

     Employment Agreement with William Mounger, II.  TeleCorp is a party to an
employment agreement with Mr. Mounger dated as of November 13, 2000. Under the
agreement, Mr. Mounger serves as the chairman of the TeleCorp board of directors
and will be paid during such period an annual base salary of $250,000, subject
to annual increases of $25,000 per year, except that in no event will Mr.
Mounger be paid a lower annual salary than Mr. Vento. In addition, Mr. Mounger
is entitled to an annual bonus under the agreement equal to the greater of 50%
of his annual salary and the annual bonus paid to Mr. Vento.

     Upon the termination of Mr. Mounger's employment, Mr. Mounger will receive
an amount equal to his accrued but unpaid compensation plus any other amounts
that are vested or to which Mr. Mounger is otherwise entitled under the terms of
any plan or agreement with TeleCorp. In addition, Mr. Mounger will receive a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the annual base salary for the period
beginning on the date of termination and ending on January 7, 2004 and the
annual bonus for each calendar year during the period beginning on the date of
termination and ending on January 7, 2004 (except for any annual bonus with
respect to 2004), assuming for this purpose that Mr. Mounger had remained
employed by TeleCorp during such period.

     Finally, upon termination of Mr. Mounger's employment with TeleCorp for any
reason, the shares of TeleCorp class E common stock held by Mr. Mounger on the
date of termination must be purchased by Messrs. Vento and Sullivan or TeleCorp
or any other person that TeleCorp may designate to purchase the shares at the
average price of TeleCorp class A voting common stock, as quoted on the Nasdaq
National

Market for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the termination of the
employment term. Mr. Mounger currently holds 5,245.70 shares of TeleCorp class E
common stock that would be subject to the purchase requirement.

     During the employment term and for a period of six months following the
termination of employment, Mr. Mounger is subject to a covenant not to compete
with TeleCorp. In addition, during the employment term and for a period of one
year following the termination of employment, Mr. Mounger is subject to a
covenant not to solicit employees of TeleCorp and its subsidiaries.

     For example, if the merger were to be completed on March 31, 2002, and Mr.
Mounger's employment were terminated on that date, based upon particular
assumptions and currently available information, the cash amount payable to Mr.
Mounger would be approximately $875,000.

     Mounger Letter Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2000.  Mr. Mounger owns
three shares of TeleCorp voting preference common stock. Under an agreement
dated as of October 31, 2000, Mr. Mounger has a put right to sell these shares
to Tritel for $10 million. If Mr. Mounger has not exercised his put right by the
time the merger is completed, he will be deemed to have exercised his put right
and will be entitled to receive $10 million from Tritel.

     TeleCorp Indemnification and Insurance.  The merger agreement provides
that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, at the completion of the merger,
AT&T Wireless and the surviving corporation will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of TeleCorp and
its subsidiaries for actions and omissions in their capacities as directors or
officers of TeleCorp on or prior to the completion of the merger. Following the
completion of the merger, with respect to such persons, the surviving
corporation shall honor all indemnification agreements and all indemnification
obligations provided by the TeleCorp amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws as of the date of the merger agreement. In addition,
for a period of six years after the completion of the merger, the limitation of
liability and indemnification provisions of the certificate of incorporation of
the surviving entity may not be amended in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the TeleCorp directors or officers holding such office at
the completion of the merger.

     The merger agreement also provides that AT&T Wireless will cause to be
maintained, for a period of six years after the completion of the merger,
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the completion of the merger covering such persons
as are currently covered by TeleCorp's policies on terms with respect to
coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those maintained by TeleCorp on
October 7, 2001. AT&T Wireless will not be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by TeleCorp for
directors' and officers' liability insurance.

     Management Voting Agreements.  Messrs. Vento and Sullivan together own
substantially all of the TeleCorp voting preference common stock, which
represents approximately 50.1% of the voting power of all of the outstanding
voting stock of TeleCorp. Messrs. Vento and Sullivan have agreed, under their
respective voting agreements, to vote all of their shares of TeleCorp stock
entitled to vote upon the merger in favor of the merger and not to transfer or
agree to transfer any of their shares of TeleCorp voting preference common
stock. At the completion of the merger, each share of TeleCorp voting preference
common stock will be converted into 0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common
stock. See "Other Agreements -- Voting Agreements" for a further description of
these restrictions.

     Cash Equity Investors Voting Agreements.  Two members of the board of
directors of TeleCorp, Mr. Hoak, on behalf of Hoak Communications Partners, L.P.
and HCP Capital Fund, L.P., and Mr. Hannon, on behalf of CB Capital Investors,
L.P., each entered into voting agreements to vote all of their shares of
TeleCorp stock entitled to vote upon the merger in favor the transaction. The
voting agreements executed by Messrs. Hoak and Hannon also restrict the amount
of shares of TeleCorp stock that each of the entities party to the voting
agreements may sell. See "Other Agreements -- Voting Agreements" for a further
description of these restrictions.

  RELATIONSHIPS WITH AT&T WIRELESS

  General

     On November 13, 2000, Tritel was acquired by TeleCorp Wireless through the
mergers of each of Tritel and TeleCorp Wireless with two newly formed
subsidiaries of a new holding company now known as TeleCorp. In accordance with
the terms of the merger agreement, all of the capital stock of TeleCorp Wireless
and Tritel was converted into the right to receive capital stock in TeleCorp. As
a result of the merger, TeleCorp is controlled by the former holders of the
voting preference common stock of TeleCorp Wireless, namely, Gerald T. Vento and
Thomas H. Sullivan. In connection with the acquisition, AT&T Wireless
contributed cash and other assets to TeleCorp in exchange for 9,272,740 shares
of the class A voting common stock of TeleCorp, thereby increasing AT&T
Wireless's holdings in TeleCorp from approximately 18% to approximately 23% of
the as converted TeleCorp class A voting common stock. This transaction was
completed immediately after the acquisition of Tritel by TeleCorp Wireless in
November 2000.

     On November 13, 2000, TeleCorp Wireless exchanged its Boston operating
division, which included PCS licenses in several New England markets, for
wireless properties or rights to designate a qualified assignee for additional
wireless properties of AT&T Wireless in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Des Moines,
Iowa markets, and a cash payment of approximately $80 million.

  TeleCorp Wireless Securities Purchase Agreement

     Under a securities purchase agreement, dated as of January 23, 1998, as
amended, among TeleCorp Wireless, its initial investors, the former stockholders
of TeleCorp Holding Corp., and Messrs. Vento and Sullivan, TeleCorp received PCS
licenses from AT&T Wireless and its affiliate, TWR Cellular, Inc., in exchange
for shares of TeleCorp Wireless's series A preferred stock, series D preferred
stock and series F preferred stock and $21 million in cash. TeleCorp Wireless's
initial investors include AT&T Wireless, Chase Capital Partners, Desai
Associates, Hoak Capital Corporation, J. H. Whitney & Co., M/C Partners, One
Liberty Fund III, L.P., Toronto Dominion Investments, Inc. and Northwood Capital
Partners. Under the securities purchase agreement, the TeleCorp Wireless initial
investors other than AT&T Wireless agreed to contribute $128 million to TeleCorp
Wireless in exchange for shares of TeleCorp Wireless's series C preferred stock,
class A voting common stock, class C common stock, and class D common stock.

  Tritel Securities Purchase Agreement

     Under a securities purchase agreement, dated as of May 20, 1998, as
amended, among Tritel, its initial investors and William M. Mounger, II, E.B.
Martin, Jr. and Jerry M. Sullivan, Jr.:

     - AT&T Wireless and TWR Cellular, Inc. assigned PCS licenses to Tritel in
       exchange for shares of Tritel series A preferred stock and series D
       preferred stock;

     - Airwave Communications and Digital PCS assigned to Tritel their
       contributed licensed areas and other assets in exchange for shares of
       Tritel series C preferred stock and the assumption of particular
       liabilities of Airwave Communications and Digital PCS, including the
       indebtedness owed to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for the Airwave
       Communications and Digital PCS contributed licensed areas; and

     - Tritel's initial investors other than AT&T Wireless purchased shares of
       Tritel series C preferred stock.

     The licenses contributed by AT&T Wireless PCS under both the TeleCorp
Wireless securities purchase agreement and Tritel securities purchase agreement
provide for the right to use 20 MHz of airwave capacity in particular geographic
areas, which AT&T Wireless PCS has partitioned and disaggregated from some of
its 30 MHz A- and B-Block PCS licenses. AT&T Wireless PCS has reserved the right
to use, market and sell to others any services on the 10 MHz of airwave capacity
that it retained, subject to the stockholders agreement and the network
membership license agreement.

  Intercarrier Roamer Service Agreement

     TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel each entered into an intercarrier roamer
service agreement with AT&T Wireless and several of its affiliates, dated as of
July 17, 1998 and January 7, 1999, respectively. Each of the agreements was
amended as of November 13, 2000. The intercarrier roamer service agreements
provide that each party, in its capacity as a serving provider, will provide
services to each other's customers where it has a license or permit to operate a
wireless communications system. Each home carrier whose customers receive
service from a serving provider will pay to the serving provider all of the
serving provider's charges for wireless service. Under TeleCorp Wireless's
intercarrier roamer service agreement, each serving provider's service charges
per minute or partial minute for use for the first four years will be fixed at a
declining rate and service charges in years five through 20 will be the lower of
a fixed rate or AT&T Wireless's average home rate. Under Tritel's intercarrier
roamer service agreement, each service provider's service charges per minute or
partial minute for use for the first three years will be fixed and the service
charges in years four through 20 will be the lower of a fixed rate or AT&T
Wireless's average home rate. In addition, after the expiration of the first
three years under the Tritel agreement, and each anniversary thereafter, roaming
rates are to be negotiated by Tritel and AT&T Wireless and such rates may not be
increased.

     Each intercarrier roamer service agreement has a term of 20 years, which is
automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis with respect to the TeleCorp
Wireless agreement and on a month-to-month basis with respect to the Tritel
agreement, unless terminated by either party upon 90 days' prior written notice.
Each intercarrier roamer service agreement may be terminated immediately by
either party upon written notice to the other of a default of the other party
or, with respect to TeleCorp Wireless, after 10 years by either party upon 90
days' prior written notice. A party will be in default under each intercarrier
roamer service agreement upon any of the following:

     - a material breach of any material term of the intercarrier roamer service
       agreement by a party that continues for 30 days after receipt of written
       notice of the breach from the non-breaching party;

     - voluntary liquidation or dissolution or the approval by the management or
       owners of a party of any plan or arrangement for the voluntary
       liquidation or dissolution of the party;

     - a final order by the FCC revoking or denying a material PCS license or
       permit granted to either party; or

     - bankruptcy or insolvency of a party.

     Each intercarrier roamer service agreement may also be suspended by either
party immediately upon written notice to the other party of the existence of a
breach of the agreement, whether or not the breach constitutes a default, if the
breach materially affects the service being provided to the customers of the
non-breaching party. While the suspension is in effect, either in whole or in
part, the parties will work together to resolve as quickly as possible the
difficulty that caused the suspension. When the party who originally gave notice
of suspension concludes that the problem causing the suspension has been
resolved, that party will give to the other written notice to this effect, and
the agreement will resume in full effect within five business days after the
parties have mutually agreed that the problem has been resolved. No party to the
intercarrier roamer service agreements may assign or transfer its rights and
obligations under the respective agreement without the written consent of the
other party, except to an affiliate or an assignee of its license.

  Roaming Administrative Service Agreement

     TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel each entered into a roaming administrative
service agreement with AT&T Wireless, dated as of July 17, 1998 and January 7,
1999, respectively. Each of the agreements was amended as of November 13, 2000.
In the roaming administrative service agreements, AT&T Wireless has agreed to
make available to TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel the benefits of the intercarrier
roaming services agreements it has entered into with other wireless carriers,
subject to the consent of the other wireless

carriers and to TeleCorp Wireless or Tritel, as applicable, remaining a member
in good standing of the North American Cellular Network.

     Each roaming administrative service agreement has an initial term of two
years, which is automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis unless terminated
by either party upon 90 days' prior written notice. Either party may terminate
the roaming administrative service agreement for any reason at any time upon 180
days' prior written notice. Either party may also terminate each of the roaming
administrative service agreements:

     - upon a material breach of the other party that is not cured or for which
       cure is not reasonably begun within 30 days after written notice of the
       claimed breach; or

     - immediately, after reasonable prior notice, if the other party's
       operations materially and unreasonably interfere with its operations and
       the interference is not eliminated within 10 days.

     AT&T Wireless can terminate each of the roaming administrative service
agreements if:

     - TeleCorp Wireless or Tritel, as applicable, is no longer a member in good
       standing of the North American Cellular Network; or

     - the agreement under which AT&T Wireless receives roaming administration
       services from a third party is terminated or expires; provided, however,
       that AT&T Wireless will offer to resume its services in the event that it
       extends or continues that agreement.

     No party to the roaming administration service agreements may assign or
transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement without the written
consent of the other party, except to an affiliate or an assignee of its
license, except that AT&T Wireless may subcontract its duties to a third party.

  Resale Agreement

     The TeleCorp stockholders agreement provides that, from time to time, at
the request of AT&T Wireless, TeleCorp is required to enter into a resale
agreement with AT&T Wireless or its affiliates or no more than one third party.
The resale agreement would grant to AT&T Wireless or its designees the right to
purchase from TeleCorp its wireless services on a non-exclusive basis within a
designated area and resell access to, and use of, its services. AT&T Wireless
must pay charges for any services that are resold, including usage, roaming,
directory assistance and long distance charges, and taxes and tariffs. Any
resale agreement would have an initial term of ten years that would be
automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis unless terminated by either party
upon 90 days' prior written notice. In addition, AT&T Wireless would be able to
terminate any resale agreement for any reason at any time upon 180 days' prior
written notice. The rates, terms and conditions of service that TeleCorp
provides are to be at least as favorable, and to the extent permitted by
applicable law, more favorable, to AT&T Wireless, taken as a whole, as the
rates, terms and conditions that TeleCorp provides to other resellers.

  Puerto Rico License

     In a series of transactions, TeleCorp Wireless acquired a license and
related assets covering the San Juan, Puerto Rico major trading area from AT&T
Wireless on May 25, 1999. The following transactions took place ultimately to
effect the acquisition of the license and related assets from AT&T Wireless:

     - on May 24, 1999, TeleCorp Wireless sold to AT&T Wireless 30,750 shares of
       its series A preferred stock, 10,250 shares of its series D preferred
       stock, and 3,090,000 shares of its series F preferred stock for $40
       million under a preferred stock purchase agreement;

     - on May 25, 1999, TeleCorp Wireless sold to its initial investors, other
       than AT&T Wireless, 39,997 shares of its series C preferred stock and
       12,358,950 shares of its class A voting common stock in exchange for an
       aggregate amount of $40 million in cash under a stock purchase agreement
       which will be funded over a three-year period;

     - on May 25, 1999, TeleCorp Wireless purchased the license for the San Juan
       major trading area and related assets, which included 27 constructed
       network equipment sites, call connection equipment and leases for
       additional network equipment sites, from AT&T Wireless for $96.5 million
       in cash under an asset purchase agreement; and

     - TeleCorp Wireless incurred $3.2 million for microwave relocation and $0.3
       million for legal expenses in connection with this acquisition.

     Under these agreements, TeleCorp Wireless's initial investors committed to
make additional equity contributions. As of September 30, 2001, approximately
$29 million of the contribution obligations have been paid and commitments for
approximately $11 million remain outstanding, subject to the same payment
obligations as contained in the July 1998 securities purchase agreement. The
outstanding commitments of $11 million are scheduled to be paid by March 31,
2002.

     In addition, Messrs. Vento and Sullivan were issued fixed and variable
awards of 4,063 and 1,633,899 restricted shares of TeleCorp Wireless series E
preferred stock and class A voting common stock, respectively, in exchange for
their interest in Puerto Rico Acquisition Corporation. Puerto Rico Acquisition
Corporation was an entity wholly owned by Messrs. Vento and Sullivan that was
created for the special purpose of acquiring the license and related assets of
the San Juan major trading area. The fixed awards vest over a five-year period.

     The variable awards vest based upon particular events taking place,
including TeleCorp's reaching milestones in its minimum construction plan. The
TeleCorp stockholders agreement sets forth network development requirements for
the Puerto Rico license. The San Juan major trading area covers a population of
approximately 3.9 million people in Puerto Rico, as well as the U.S. Virgin
Islands.

  Stockholders Agreement

     General.  TeleCorp entered into a stockholders agreement, dated as of
November 13, 2000, with AT&T Wireless, some of TeleCorp Wireless's and Tritel's
initial investors, and Messrs. Mounger, Martin, Vento and Sullivan.

     Board of Directors.  The stockholders agreement requires that any action of
the TeleCorp board of directors be approved by the affirmative vote of a
majority of its entire board of directors, except in circumstances where voting
by particular classes of directors is required.

     The stockholders agreement also provides that the TeleCorp board of
directors will consist of 13 directors.

     The parties to the stockholders agreement have agreed to vote all of their
shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock and voting preference common
stock to cause the election of the following 13 individuals to the TeleCorp
board of directors:

     - Messrs. Vento and Sullivan, so long as each remains an officer and the
       management agreement with TeleCorp Management Corp. remains in effect;

     - subject to the provisions described below which limit such selection
       rights, two individuals selected by holders of a majority in interest of
       the class A voting common stock beneficially owned by TeleCorp Wireless's
       initial investors other than AT&T Wireless;

     - subject to the provisions described below which limit such selection
       rights, two individuals selected by holders of a majority in interest of
       the class A voting common stock beneficially owned by Tritel's initial
       investors other than AT&T Wireless;

     - two individuals designated by AT&T Wireless in its capacity as a holder
       of TeleCorp series A convertible preferred stock and series B convertible
       preferred stock so long as AT&T Wireless has the right to elect each such
       director in accordance with the TeleCorp certificate of incorporation;
       and

     - five individuals designated by the holders of the TeleCorp voting
       preference common stock, which include:

      - one individual who must be reasonably acceptable to AT&T Wireless;

      - Mr. Mounger so long as he remains an officer and employee of TeleCorp,
        or one individual who must be reasonably acceptable to Mr. Mounger; and

      - three individuals who must be reasonably acceptable to holders of a
        majority in interest of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock
        beneficially owned by AT&T Wireless on the one hand, and the TeleCorp
        Wireless and Tritel initial investors other than AT&T Wireless, on the
        other hand, so long as the TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel initial
        investors other than AT&T Wireless remain entitled to designate at least
        two directors, or, if they are not entitled, then by the remaining
        directors on the board of directors.

     In the event that Mr. Mounger ceases to be an officer or employee of
TeleCorp and either the number of shares of TeleCorp common stock beneficially
owned by Messrs. Mounger and Martin, in aggregate, falls below 70% of the number
of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them on November 13, 2000, or
two years have elapsed from November 13, 2000, Mr. Mounger will resign or be
removed from the board of directors. In the event that Mr. Mounger is no longer
a member of the board of directors, the number of directors designated by the
holders of the voting preference common stock who require approval by Mr.
Mounger will be reduced to zero, and the number of directors designated by the
holders of the voting preference common stock and acceptable to holders of a
majority in interest of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock beneficially
owned by AT&T Wireless, on one hand, and TeleCorp Wireless's initial investors
and Tritel's initial investors other than AT&T Wireless on the other hand will
be increased to four.

     In the event that Mr. Vento or Mr. Sullivan ceases to be an officer of
TeleCorp, or the management agreement between TeleCorp and TeleCorp Management
Corp. ceases to be in full force and effect, Mr. Vento or Mr. Sullivan, as
applicable, will resign or be removed from the board of directors and the
holders of the voting preference common stock will select a replacement or
replacements who must be acceptable to a majority in interest of the TeleCorp
Wireless and Tritel initial investors, other than AT&T Wireless, and AT&T
Wireless, in their sole discretion. In the event that AT&T Wireless ceases to be
entitled to designate directors, the director or directors designated by AT&T
Wireless will resign or be removed from the TeleCorp board of directors and the
size of the TeleCorp board of directors will be reduced accordingly.

     The number of directors that the TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel initial
investors other than AT&T Wireless will be permitted to designate will be
reduced when the number of shares of common stock of TeleCorp beneficially owned
by the initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T
Wireless on a fully diluted basis falls below:

     - 85% of the number of shares of common stock of TeleCorp beneficially
       owned by them on November 13, 2000;

     - 70% of the number of shares of common stock of TeleCorp beneficially
       owned by them on November 13, 2000;

     - 60% of the number of shares of common stock of TeleCorp beneficially
       owned by them on November 13, 2000; and

     - 50% of the number of shares of common stock of TeleCorp beneficially
       owned by them on November 13, 2000.

     The effect of this arrangement is that the initial investors of TeleCorp
Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T Wireless will be permitted to designate
three, two, one or zero directors respectively; provided, however, that the
reductions in the board of directors may not take place or may be delayed if
some of the initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T
Wireless hold or maintain a specified percentage of common stock as set forth in
the stockholders agreement.

     In each instance in which the number of directors the initial investors of
TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T Wireless are entitled to designate
is reduced, the director designated by the TeleCorp Wireless initial investor or
Tritel initial investor other than AT&T Wireless beneficially owning the

smallest percentage of shares of common stock then owned by any of the initial
investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T Wireless whose
designees then remain as directors will resign or be removed from the board of
directors and the size of the TeleCorp board of directors will be reduced
accordingly. In the event that either:

     - the number of directors the initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and
       Tritel other than AT&T Wireless are entitled to designate falls below
       two; or

     - both the initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than
       AT&T Wireless entitled to designate the last two directors that the
       initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T
       Wireless may designate cease to beneficially own at least 75% of the
       number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them on the
       completion of the acquisition of Tritel by TeleCorp Wireless,

the initial investors of TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel other than AT&T Wireless
will no longer be entitled to approve any designation of TeleCorp directors or
approve any director that replaces Messrs. Vento or Sullivan on the board of
directors.

     Exclusivity.  The parties to the stockholders agreement have agreed that,
during the term of the stockholders agreement, neither they nor any of their
respective affiliates will provide or resell, or act as the agent for any person
offering, within the areas covered by licenses of TeleCorp, wireless
communications services initiated or terminated using TDMA and portions of the
airwaves licensed by the FCC, except that AT&T Wireless and its affiliates will
be able to:

     - resell or act as agent for TeleCorp in connection with mobile wireless
       communications services;

     - provide or resell wireless communications services only to or from
       specific locations, provided that any equipment sold in connection with
       the service must be capable of providing TeleCorp wireless communications
       services; and

     - resell mobile wireless communications services from another person in any
       area where TeleCorp has not placed a system into commercial service.

     In addition, with respect to some markets identified in the intercarrier
roamer service agreements with AT&T Wireless, each of TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless
has agreed to cause its respective affiliates in its home carrier capacities to:

     - program and direct the programming of customer equipment so that the
       other party, in its capacity as the serving carrier, is the preferred
       provider in these markets; and

     - refrain from inducing any of its customers to change such programming.

     AT&T Wireless has retained some PCS licenses within the areas covered by
TeleCorp licenses for which TeleCorp has a right of negotiation in the event of
a proposed transfer.

     If TeleCorp materially breaches any of its obligations, AT&T Wireless may
terminate its exclusivity obligations under the stockholders agreement and may
terminate the rights of TeleCorp to the AT&T brand and logo under the license
agreement if a default continues after the applicable cure periods lapse. These
material breaches include, if:

     - TeleCorp fails to meet its minimum build-out requirements for its systems
       as set forth in the stockholders agreement;

     - AT&T Wireless and its affiliates decide to adopt a new technology
       standard other than TDMA in a majority of its markets, and TeleCorp
       declines to adopt the new technology;

     - each portion of the TeleCorp network does not, within one year after
       being placed into service, meet or exceed technical standards that AT&T
       Wireless has developed regarding voice quality and performance of network
       and call completion equipment. Each portion of the network must, within
       one year after being placed into service, perform on a level, measured by
       these standards manuals,

       that meets or exceeds the levels achieved by the average of all
       comparable wireless communications networks owned and operated by AT&T
       Wireless;

     - TeleCorp fails to satisfy specific performance targets that its entire
       network, measured as a single system, must meet, including percentage of
       calls completed, percentage of established calls dropped, percentages of
       calls not successfully transferred from one network equipment site to
       another as a handset moves, as well as technical standards regarding the
       functioning of network and call connection equipment; or

     - TeleCorp fails to meet specified customer care, reception quality and
       network reliability standards.

     The exclusivity provisions in the stockholders agreement do not apply to
AT&T Wireless or its affiliates with respect to portions of Kentucky in which
AT&T Wireless and its affiliates had an existing roaming agreement in place with
another wireless provider or in East Carroll, Franklin, Madison, Morehouse,
Ouachita, Richland, Tensas, Union or West Carroll, Louisiana.

     Construction.  The stockholders agreement requires TeleCorp to construct a
PCS system in the areas covered by its licenses according to a minimum build-out
plan prepared by the company and approved by AT&T Wireless, which upon projected
completion at sometime before July 17, 2003, will cover over 75% of the people
in the areas covered by the licenses of TeleCorp in accordance with FCC
build-out requirements.

     Disqualifying Transactions. If AT&T Corp. (or any of its affiliates) and an
entity that:

     - derives annual revenues from communications businesses in excess of $5
       billion;

     - derives less than one-third of its aggregate revenues from wireless
       communications; and

     - owns FCC licenses to offer, and does offer, mobile wireless
       communications services serving more than 25% of the residents, as
       determined by Paul Kagan Associates, within the areas covered by TeleCorp
       subsidiaries,

merge, consolidate, acquire or dispose of assets to each other, or otherwise
combine, then AT&T Wireless, upon written notice to TeleCorp, may terminate its
exclusivity obligations where the territory covered by the licenses of TeleCorp
overlaps with commercial mobile radio service licenses of the business
combination partner. Upon such termination, TeleCorp will have the right to
cause AT&T Wireless or any transferee that acquired any shares of TeleCorp
series A convertible preferred stock, series B preferred stock, series D
preferred stock, series F preferred stock or series G preferred stock then owned
by AT&T Wireless, and any shares of TeleCorp common stock into which any of
these shares are converted, to exchange all, or a proportionate share based on
overlapping service areas after such disqualifying transaction, of their shares
into shares of series H and I preferred stock. In the event of any such
exchange, AT&T Wireless will be able to terminate its exclusivity obligations in
all of TeleCorp's markets.

     Once so converted, TeleCorp will be able to redeem the shares of series H
and I preferred stock at any time in accordance with its restated certificate of
incorporation.

     Under some circumstances, if AT&T Wireless proposes to sell, transfer or
assign to any person that is not an affiliate of AT&T Wireless, any PCS system
owned and operated by AT&T Wireless and its affiliates in any of the St. Louis,
Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; or Atlanta, Georgia basic trading areas, then
AT&T Wireless will have to provide TeleCorp with the opportunity to offer its
network in such areas for sale jointly with AT&T Wireless for a 90-day period.

     Acquisition of Licenses.  TeleCorp may acquire any PCS licenses within its
territory. The stockholders agreement also provides that TeleCorp may acquire
any cellular license that its board of directors has determined is a
demonstrably superior alternative to constructing a PCS system within the
corresponding areas covered by its licenses, if:

     - a majority of the population covered by the license is within the areas
       covered by the licenses of TeleCorp;

     - AT&T Wireless and its affiliates do not own commercial mobile radio
       service licenses in the area covered by the license; and

     - the ownership of the license by TeleCorp will not cause AT&T Wireless or
       any affiliate to be in breach of any law or contract.

     Vendor Discounts; Roaming Agreements.  AT&T Wireless has agreed in the
stockholders agreement that, if TeleCorp requests, and if such request shall not
result in any adverse impact to AT&T Wireless, it will use all commercially
reasonable efforts:

     - to assist TeleCorp in obtaining discounts from any AT&T Wireless vendor
       with whom it is negotiating for the purchase of any infrastructure
       equipment or billing services; and

     - to enable TeleCorp to become a party to the roaming agreements between
       AT&T Wireless and its affiliates and operators of other cellular and PCS
       systems.

     Subsidiaries.  The stockholders agreement provides that all of the
subsidiaries of TeleCorp must be direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.
The stockholders agreement also provides that with respect to such subsidiaries,
TeleCorp may not sell or dispose of a substantial portion of the assets or any
of the capital stock of any of such subsidiaries except in connection with a
pledge to secure indebtedness.

     Restrictions on Transfer.  The stockholders agreement restricts the sale,
transfer or other disposition of TeleCorp capital stock, such as by giving
rights of first offer and tag along rights and providing demand and piggyback
registration rights.

     If one of the TeleCorp stockholders who is a party to the stockholders
agreement desires to transfer any or all of its shares of the TeleCorp preferred
or common stock, other than voting preference common stock, class C common stock
or class E common stock, the selling stockholder must first give written notice
to TeleCorp and:

     - if the selling stockholder is one of the initial investors of TeleCorp
       Wireless or Tritel other than AT&T Wireless or any other stockholder who
       is a party to the stockholders agreement, to AT&T Wireless; and

     - if the selling stockholder is AT&T Wireless, to each of the initial
       investors of TeleCorp Wireless or Tritel other than AT&T Wireless.

     The stockholders who receive notice from the selling stockholders may
acquire all, but not less than all, of the shares offered to be sold at the
price offered by the selling stockholder. If none of the stockholders opts to
purchase the shares of the selling stockholder, the selling stockholder will be
able to sell its shares to any other person on the same terms and conditions as
originally offered to the stockholders. The right of first offer does not apply
to the repurchase of any shares of TeleCorp class A voting common stock or
series E preferred stock from one of the employees of TeleCorp in connection
with the termination of the employee's employment with TeleCorp.

     A stockholder subject to the stockholders agreement may not transfer 25%
(on a fully diluted basis as calculated under the stockholders agreement) or
more of any of the shares of TeleCorp capital stock, whether alone or with other
stockholders or whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, unless
the proposed transfer includes an offer to AT&T Wireless, the TeleCorp Wireless
initial investors and Tritel initial investors other than AT&T Wireless and Mr.
Vento and Mr. Sullivan to join in the transfer in accordance with the procedures
included in the stockholders agreement regarding the inclusion of other
stockholders in the proposed transfer.

     TeleCorp Acquisition Transactions.  The stockholders agreement provides
that, without the consent of a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless, TeleCorp and its
subsidiaries may not merge, combine or consolidate with any entity, or dispose
of a substantial portion of its assets, or liquidate, dissolve or wind up.

     However, TeleCorp and its subsidiaries may acquire another entity by
merger, combination or consolidation, without the consent of a subsidiary of
AT&T Wireless, if such transaction does not affect

the capital structure of TeleCorp (except to the extent TeleCorp issues common
stock to the stockholders of the other entity under the terms of such
transaction) and the surviving corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of
TeleCorp.

     Moreover, TeleCorp and its subsidiaries may merge, combine, or consolidate
with another entity or dispose of a substantial portion of their assets, without
the consent of a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless, if

     - such transaction has no material effect on the equity interest in
       TeleCorp (and the seniority thereof) of such subsidiary of AT&T Wireless
       or such subsidiary's rights under the stockholders agreement;

     - TeleCorp's direct or indirect interest in its assets is unaffected by
       such transaction in any material respect; and

     - such transaction is otherwise equivalent in all material respects, with
       respect to a subsidiary of AT&T Wireless, to the sale by each of the
       other TeleCorp stockholders that are party to the stockholders agreement
       of their equity interests in TeleCorp for cash or marketable securities.

     A subsidiary of AT&T Wireless has a right of first refusal relating to any
such transaction with TeleCorp.

     Registration Rights.  The TeleCorp stockholders that are party to the
stockholders agreement also have demand and piggyback registration rights. In
some circumstances, the TeleCorp stockholders may demand that TeleCorp register
some or all of their securities with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.
Also, if TeleCorp proposes to register any shares of class A voting common stock
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for class A voting common stock
with the SEC under the Securities Act, TeleCorp will have to notify stockholders
party to the stockholders agreement of its intention to do so, and such
stockholders may be able to include in the registration their shares of class A
voting common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for class A
voting common stock, subject to cutback provisions based on limitations on the
number of shares which may be offered as determined by the underwriters in the
offering.

     Amendments.  The terms of the stockholders agreement may only be amended if
agreed to in writing by TeleCorp and the beneficial holders of a majority of the
class A voting common stock party to the stockholders agreement including AT&T
Wireless, and 66 2/3% of the class A voting common stock beneficially owned by
TeleCorp Wireless initial investors and Tritel initial investors other than AT&T
Wireless, and 66 2/3% of the class A voting common stock beneficially owned by
Messrs. Vento and Sullivan.

     Termination.  The stockholders agreement will terminate upon the earliest
to occur of:

     - the written consent of each party;

     - July 17, 2009; and

     - the date on which a single stockholder beneficially owns all of the
       outstanding shares of class A voting common stock.

  Amendment No. 1 to Stockholders Agreement

     The TeleCorp stockholders agreement was amended on October 7, 2001 to allow
stockholders of TeleCorp to enter into voting agreements in connection with the
merger. See "Other Agreements -- Stockholders Agreement Amendment" for a further
description of this amendment.

  Put and Call Agreement

     In connection with its acquisition of PCS licenses and equipment from
ALLTEL, Tritel PCS, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tritel, entered into a
put and call agreement with AT&T Wireless on October 20, 2000. Under the put and
call agreement Tritel has the right to sell the two licenses acquired

from ALLTEL to AT&T Wireless for $50 million at any time during the 18 months
following the completion of the ALLTEL acquisition on December 29, 2000.
Similarly, unless within 10 days of notice from AT&T Wireless of its intention
to exercise its call right, Tritel renounces its put right, upon which the put
and call agreement will terminate, AT&T Wireless has the right to purchase the
two licenses from Tritel during the same 18-month period for $50 million. In the
event of the acquisition of all of TeleCorp's voting preference common stock by
an AT&T Wireless competitor that is not approved by AT&T Wireless, Tritel's
right to renounce the put right and negate the exercise of AT&T Wireless's call
right will terminate. In addition, during the period between the signing of
definitive documents to complete such an acquisition and the completion of such
an acquisition, Tritel's right to negate the exercise of AT&T Wireless's call
right and AT&T Wireless's call right will both be suspended. If such a change of
control is not completed, all rights under the put and call agreement will be
reinstated.

     The agreement was amended by the merger agreement so that if the merger
agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Tritel's put right with
respect to the two licenses will be exercisable through the fifth day following
such termination.

  AT&T Wireless Right of First Refusal to Purchase Shares of TeleCorp Stock

     On November 13, 2000 each of Gerald T. Vento and Thomas H. Sullivan granted
AT&T Wireless or its designee a right of first refusal to purchase their
respective shares of TeleCorp voting preference common stock, class C common
stock or class D common stock. These agreements were amended as of December 22,
2000. Currently, the holders of TeleCorp voting preference common stock control
a majority of the voting power of TeleCorp. In the event that either Mr. Vento
or Mr. Sullivan receives a bona fide offer that he intends to accept from a
third party to purchase all of his shares of TeleCorp voting preference common
stock, class C common stock or class D common stock, AT&T Wireless or its
designee has the option, but not the obligation, to purchase all such shares on
the same terms as the third party offer. The purchase price per share payable by
AT&T Wireless or its designee for any of the subject shares would be equal to
the lesser of:

     - the price offered by the third party; and

     - the average closing price per share for the TeleCorp class A voting
       common stock for the five trading days ending two days prior to the date
       of execution of the third party offer.

  Letter Agreement Terminating Equity Purchase and Put Rights Agreements

     On February 14, 2001, Mr. Gerald T. Vento, Mr. Thomas H. Sullivan and AT&T
Wireless entered into a letter agreement that terminated the equity purchase
agreement and the put rights agreement described below.

     The equity purchase agreement, which was dated as of December 22, 2000,
provided for AT&T Wireless to purchase 1,339,602 shares of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock, 490 shares of TeleCorp series C preferred stock and 6,540
shares of TeleCorp series E preferred stock from Mr. Vento, and 896,064 shares
of TeleCorp class A voting common stock, 108 shares of TeleCorp series C
preferred stock and 4,009 shares of TeleCorp series E preferred stock from Mr.
Sullivan, in each case at a purchase price of $21 per share, payable in cash or
marketable securities. The equity purchase agreement also provided that the
completion of such purchase and sale would occur, subject to the receipt of
regulatory approvals and the fulfillment or waiver of other conditions, on the
earlier of January 2, 2002 and three business days following notice from AT&T
Wireless.

     Under the put rights agreement, which was dated as of December 22, 2000,
Messrs. Vento and Sullivan had the right to require AT&T Wireless to purchase up
to 2,917,988 shares and 2,003,901 shares, respectively, of TeleCorp class A
voting common stock at a purchase price equal to the lesser of $18.30 and the
20-trading day average closing price of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock
at the time of the purchase and sale, payable in cash or marketable securities.
This right was exercisable from August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2005. However,
if the average closing price of the TeleCorp class A voting common stock was
$16.30 or more during any 20-trading day period before July 31, 2004, the
exercise period would

expire on July 31, 2004, and if the average closing price of the TeleCorp class
A voting common stock was $16.30 or more during any 20-trading day period after
July 31, 2004 but before July 31, 2005, the exercise period would expire ten
days after the end of such 20-trading day period.

  Equity Purchase Agreements

     Messrs. Sullivan and Vento owned a number of privately held entities formed
for the purpose of acquiring and holding C and F block PCS licenses, none of
which cover areas in which TeleCorp is contractually permitted to operate. Some
of the entities were formed prior to the organization of TeleCorp. Scott I.
Anderson, a member of the board of directors of TeleCorp, has a one-third
interest in three of these entities. AT&T Wireless has financed license
acquisitions and operating expenses of these entities.

     On December 22, 2000, Messrs. Sullivan and Vento agreed to sell their
interests in each of the entities for substantial consideration to a company in
which AT&T Wireless holds an 85% interest. These transactions are expected to
close during the first quarter of 2002.

     On December 22, 2000, Mr. Anderson agreed to relinquish his interests in
the entities in exchange for the transfer to him, or to a limited liability
company in which he has a controlling interest, of a number of the C and F block
PCS licenses held by the entities, plus the cancellation of his indebtedness
with respect to these entities, other than the indebtedness incurred with
respect to the licenses assigned to him or to the limited liability company.
AT&T Wireless also agreed to pay, or to enable the limited liability company to
pay, significant consideration to the members of the limited liability company
if the limited liability company was unable to generate a certain amount from
the sale of its licenses. These transactions are expected to close during the
first quarter of 2002. AT&T Wireless has extended a line of credit to the
limited liability company to be used for license acquisitions and operating
expenses. The line of credit is evidenced by a promissory note that is
convertible into an aggregate of 15% of the interests of the limited liability
company.

  Commitment Agreement

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp intend to enter into a commitment agreement
under which AT&T Wireless will agree to provide a total of $500 million in
financing to TeleCorp and its subsidiary TeleCorp Wireless, Inc. The obligation
of AT&T Wireless to provide the financing contemplated by the commitment
agreement will not be conditioned on the completion of the merger.

     The financing contemplated by the commitment agreement will take the form
of senior subordinated debt and senior debt as follows:

     - $151,591,000 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior
       subordinated debt, evidenced by 10% discount notes due 2011 of TeleCorp,
       yielding TeleCorp gross proceeds of $100 million, to be advanced on
       January 10, 2002;

     - $162,520,000 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior
       subordinated debt, evidenced by 10% discount notes due 2011 of TeleCorp,
       yielding TeleCorp gross proceeds of $110 million, to be advanced on April
       15, 2002;

     - up to $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated
       debt, evidenced by 9% notes due 2009 of TeleCorp Wireless, to be advanced
       at the election of TeleCorp Wireless from time to time on or prior to
       March 30, 2002; and

     - $40 million of term loans under the senior credit facility of TeleCorp
       Wireless to be advanced from time to time on or before March 30, 2002.

     10% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2011 of TeleCorp.  The 10%
senior subordinated discount notes will be issued under the indenture dated as
of April 6, 2001 relating to TeleCorp's senior subordinated discount notes due
2011. Cash interest will not accrue or be payable on the 10% senior subordinated
discount notes before April 15, 2006. Cash interest will begin to accrue on
April 15, 2006 at an annual rate of 10% and will be payable semiannually.

     Beginning April 15, 2006, TeleCorp will have the option to redeem the 10%
senior subordinated discount notes at the following prices:

April 15, 2006 - April 14, 2007             105.000% of principal amount
April 15, 2007 - April 14, 2008             103.333% of principal amount
April 15, 2008 - April 14, 2009             101.667% of principal amount
April 15, 2009 and thereafter               100.000% of principal amount

     In addition, TeleCorp will have the option to redeem up to 35% of the
aggregate principal amount at maturity of the 10% senior subordinated discount
notes at any time and from time to time before April 15, 2004 at a price of
110.000% of the accreted value on the redemption date with the proceeds of one
or more private or public offerings of equity securities which do not mature and
are not mandatorily redeemable or redeemable at the option of the holder.

     The indenture for the 10% senior subordinated discount notes contains
covenants that are customary for similar senior subordinated indebtedness,
including covenants that restrict the incurrence of indebtedness, particular
payments, including the payment of dividends or distributions in respect of
capital stock and prepayments of subordinated loans, sales of assets, particular
transactions with affiliates, and particular mergers, consolidations and
liquidations. In addition, TeleCorp's restricted subsidiaries may not restrict
their ability to make payments to TeleCorp or its restricted subsidiaries.

     Under some circumstances, including in the event that a person or group
(other than specified entities including AT&T Wireless) acquires more than 50%
of TeleCorp's voting stock, TeleCorp will be required to offer to purchase each
holder's 10% senior subordinated discount notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the accreted value of the holder's notes if the purchase date
is on or before April 15, 2006, or 101% of the principal amount at maturity if
the purchase date is after April 15, 2006, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

     9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 of TeleCorp Wireless.  The 9% senior
subordinated notes will be issued under an indenture substantially similar to
the indenture dated as of July 14, 2000 relating to the 10 5/8% senior
subordinated notes due 2010 of TeleCorp Wireless, except for terms relating to
interest payments, maturity and optional redemption. Beginning on April 1, 2002,
TeleCorp Wireless will make semiannual interest payments at an annual rate of 9%
on the 9% senior subordinated notes.

     Beginning April 1, 2006, TeleCorp Wireless will have the option to redeem
the 9% senior subordinated notes at the following prices:

April 1, 2006 - March 31, 2007              104.500% of principal amount
April 1, 2007 - March 31, 2008              102.250% of principal amount
April 1, 2008 and thereafter                100.000% of principal amount

     In addition, TeleCorp Wireless will have the option to redeem up to 35% of
the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the 9% senior subordinated notes
at any time and from time to time before April 1, 2006 at a price of 109.000% of
the principal amount on the redemption date with the proceeds of one or more
private or public offerings of equity securities of TeleCorp Wireless or
TeleCorp (if TeleCorp contributes the offering proceeds to TeleCorp Wireless)
which do not mature and are not mandatorily redeemable or redeemable at the
option of the holder.

     The indenture for the 9% senior subordinated notes will contain covenants
that are customary for similar senior subordinated indebtedness, including the
covenants, described above, applicable to the 10% senior subordinated discount
notes.

     Under some circumstances, including in the event that a person or group
(other than specified entities including AT&T Wireless) acquires more than 50%
of TeleCorp's voting stock, TeleCorp will be required to offer to purchase each
holder's 9% senior subordinated notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

     TeleCorp will pay AT&T Wireless a commitment fee, payable on April 1, 2002,
at a rate of 6% per year on the unfunded portion of the $250 million commitment.

     The purchase by AT&T Wireless of the 9% senior subordinated notes will
reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of indebtedness that TeleCorp and
its subsidiaries are entitled to incur in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement.

     Term Loans under Credit Agreement.  At the election of TeleCorp Wireless
from time to time on or before March 30, 2002, AT&T Wireless will advance up to
$40 million in term loans under the senior credit facility of TeleCorp Wireless.
The loans will mature on July 17, 2008 and have an interest rate equal to LIBOR
plus 3.50% per year.

     Any advance made by AT&T Wireless to TeleCorp Wireless under the senior
credit facility of TeleCorp Wireless will reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis
the amount of indebtedness that TeleCorp and its subsidiaries are entitled to
incur in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

  Purchase from Lucent of TeleCorp Senior Subordinated Discount Notes

     Under a note purchase agreement that AT&T Wireless intends to enter into
with Lucent Technologies Inc., AT&T Wireless would acquire from Lucent
Technologies Inc. a total of $220,500,000 in aggregate accreted value of senior
subordinated debt of TeleCorp. This indebtedness is evidenced by $358,248,000 in
aggregate principal amount at maturity of 11% senior subordinated discount notes
due April 15, 2011 of TeleCorp. These 11% senior subordinated discount notes
were issued under the indenture, dated as of April 6, 2001, described above.
AT&T Wireless would acquire this TeleCorp indebtedness from Lucent for a total
of $209 million.

  Directors Affiliated with AT&T Wireless

     Under the stockholders agreement, AT&T Wireless, as holder of the TeleCorp
series A convertible preferred stock and series B preferred stock, has the right
to designate two directors to the board of directors of TeleCorp. In addition,
one of five individuals selected by the holders of the TeleCorp voting
preference common stock must be reasonably acceptable to AT&T Wireless and an
additional three of such directors must be reasonably acceptable to particular
stockholders, including AT&T Wireless. Under the exclusive appointment and
approval rights of AT&T Wireless, Messrs. Benson and Hague and Ms. Hall were
designated or approved by AT&T Wireless as directors of TeleCorp. Messrs. Benson
and Hague and Ms. Hall did not participate in the deliberations of the TeleCorp
board meeting with regard to the merger.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     After the merger is completed, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., acting as
exchange agent for AT&T Wireless, will mail to each holder of record of shares
of TeleCorp common stock or TeleCorp preferred stock instructions and a form of
transmittal letter, for the exchange of the holder's TeleCorp stock certificates
for a certificate representing AT&T Wireless common stock or, in the case of
holders of TeleCorp series C and E preferred stock, AT&T Wireless preferred
stock. You should not send in your certificates until you receive the letter of
transmittal form and instructions.

     No dividend or other distribution declared on AT&T Wireless common stock
after completion of the merger will be paid to the holder of any certificates
for shares of TeleCorp capital stock until after the certificates have been
surrendered for exchange. When the exchange agent receives a surrendered
certificate or certificates from a holder of TeleCorp capital stock, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, it will issue and mail to the
stockholder a certificate representing the number of whole shares of AT&T
Wireless common stock or AT&T Wireless preferred stock to which the stockholder
is entitled, plus cash for the amount of any remaining fractional share and any
cash dividends that are payable with respect to the shares of AT&T Wireless
common stock so issued. No interest will be paid on the fractional share amount
or amounts payable as dividends or other distributions.

     A certificate for AT&T Wireless common stock or preferred stock may be
issued in a name other than the name in which the surrendered certificate is
registered if (1) the certificate surrendered is properly endorsed and
accompanied by all documents required to transfer the shares to the new holder
and (2) the person requesting the issuance of the AT&T Wireless common stock or
preferred stock certificate either pays to the exchange agent in advance any
transfer and other taxes due or establishes to the satisfaction of the exchange
agent that such taxes have been paid or are not due.

     The exchange agent will issue stock certificates for AT&T Wireless common
stock or preferred stock in exchange for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates
for TeleCorp common stock or TeleCorp preferred stock upon receipt of a lost
certificate affidavit and a bond indemnifying AT&T Wireless for any claim that
may be made against AT&T Wireless as a result of the lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates.

     After completion of the merger, no stock transfers will be permitted on the
books of TeleCorp. If, after completion of the merger, certificates for TeleCorp
common stock or TeleCorp preferred stock are presented for transfer to the
exchange agent, they will be canceled and exchanged for certificates
representing AT&T Wireless common stock or preferred stock.

     None of AT&T Wireless, TeleCorp, the exchange agent or any other person
will be liable to any former holder of TeleCorp common stock or TeleCorp
preferred stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
under applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

LITIGATION REGARDING THE MERGER

     TeleCorp, TeleCorp's directors and AT&T Wireless are named as defendants in
several lawsuits brought in the Court of Chancery, County of New Castle, State
of Delaware arising out of the merger. The complaints in these actions, which
are substantially the same, allege that the consideration to be received by the
public stockholders of TeleCorp in the merger is unfair and grossly inadequate,
and that the directors of TeleCorp breached their fiduciary duties in connection
with the approval of the merger. The complaints also allege, among other things,
that AT&T Wireless has aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary
duties by TeleCorp's directors. The complaints are brought on behalf of a
purported nationwide class of all public stockholders of TeleCorp (excluding
defendants, including AT&T Wireless). As relief, the complaints seek, among
other things, an injunction against completion of the merger, rescission of the
merger if it occurs, and/or an award of damages in an unspecified amount. AT&T
Wireless and TeleCorp each believes that the allegations of the complaints are
without merit.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, holders of TeleCorp class A voting common stock are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

     Holders of all other classes of TeleCorp capital stock are entitled to
appraisal rights under Delaware law and, accordingly, have the right to demand
and receive payment of the fair value of their shares in lieu of receiving the
merger consideration, provided that these stockholders comply with the
procedural requirements set forth under Delaware law for perfecting this right.

     In order to exercise appraisal rights, a stockholder must demand and
perfect the rights in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The following is a summary of the material provisions of
Section 262 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a
complete copy of which is attached as Annex F to this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should carefully review Section 262 as well as the
information discussed below to determine your appraisal rights.

     In order to perfect your appraisal rights, you must:

     - deliver to TeleCorp at its main office in Arlington, Virginia a written
       demand for appraisal of the applicable shares before the vote is taken on
       the merger agreement at the TeleCorp special meeting. This written demand
       for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote
       against the merger agreement because voting against or abstaining from
       voting or failing to

vote on the merger agreement will not constitute a demand for appraisal within
the meaning of Section 262;

     - not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the merger agreement.
       Failing to vote or abstaining from voting will satisfy this requirement,
       but a vote in favor of the merger agreement, by proxy or in person, or
       the return of a signed proxy card that does not specify a vote against
       approval and adoption of the merger agreement, will constitute a waiver
       of the TeleCorp stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any
       previously filed written demand for appraisal; and

     - continuously hold such shares through the completion of the merger.

     All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to TeleCorp PCS,
Inc., 1010 North Glebe Road, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22201, Attention: Investor
Relations. This demand must reasonably inform TeleCorp of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder is demanding appraisal of the applicable
shares.

     Within 10 days after the completion of the merger, the surviving
corporation of the merger will give written notice of the completion of the
merger to each TeleCorp stockholder that has satisfied the requirements of
Section 262 and has not voted for or consented to the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. We refer to such a stockholder as a "dissenting stockholder."

     Within 120 days after the completion of the merger, the surviving
corporation or any dissenting stockholder may file a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the applicable
shares that are held by all dissenting stockholders holding shares of such
class. We advise any dissenting stockholder desiring to file this petition to
file such petition on a timely basis unless the dissenting stockholder receives
notice that a petition has already been filed with respect to such shares by the
surviving corporation or another dissenting stockholder.

     If a petition for appraisal is timely filed, the court will determine which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights. The court will then determine the
fair value of the applicable shares held by the dissenting stockholders,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger, but together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid on
the amount determined to be fair value. In determining the fair value, the court
will take into account all relevant factors. The court may determine the fair
value to be more than, less than or equal to the consideration that the
dissenting stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive under the merger
agreement. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an
appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by
the court and charged against the parties as the court determines to be
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the court
may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged
pro rata against the value of all shares which are the subject of the appraisal.

     From and after the completion of the merger, no dissenting stockholder will
have any rights of a TeleCorp stockholder with respect to the shares which are
the subject of the appraisal, except to receive payment of their fair value and
to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the applicable shares,
if any, payable to TeleCorp stockholders of record holding such shares as of a
date prior to the completion of the merger. If a dissenting stockholder delivers
to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal
within 60 days after the completion of the merger, or if no petition for
appraisal is filed within 120 days after the completion of the merger, then the
right of that dissenting stockholder to an appraisal will cease and the
dissenting stockholder will be entitled to receive only the merger
consideration.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger
agreement and you are urged to read the merger agreement carefully, as it is the
legal document governing the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is
incorporated by reference and attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER

     The merger agreement provides that, at the time the merger is completed, TL
Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Wireless, will merge with
and into TeleCorp. TeleCorp will be the surviving corporation in the merger and
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Wireless. If necessary in order to
permit delivery of the required tax opinions, AT&T Wireless will merge the
resulting subsidiary into AT&T Wireless immediately after the merger.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of TeleCorp common stock and
preferred stock will be converted into securities of AT&T Wireless, as follows:

     Common Stock.  Each share of TeleCorp common stock will be exchanged for
0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock.

     Preferred Stock.  Each share of TeleCorp preferred stock will be converted
into either shares of AT&T Wireless common stock or shares of AT&T Wireless
preferred stock, as follows:

     - each share of TeleCorp series A convertible preferred stock will be
       converted into 82.9849 shares of AT&T Wireless common stock;

     - each share of TeleCorp series B preferred stock will be converted into
       81.2439 shares of AT&T Wireless common stock;

     - each share of TeleCorp series C preferred stock will be exchanged on a
       one-to-one basis for one share of a new series of AT&T Wireless preferred
       stock having terms substantially identical to the terms of the TeleCorp
       series C preferred stock;

     - each share of TeleCorp series D preferred stock will be converted into
       27.6425 shares of AT&T Wireless common stock;

     - each share of TeleCorp series E preferred stock will be exchanged on a
       one-to-one basis for one share of a new series of AT&T Wireless preferred
       stock having terms substantially identical to the terms of the TeleCorp
       series E preferred stock;

     - each share of TeleCorp series F preferred stock will be converted into
       0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock; and

     - each share of TeleCorp series G preferred stock will be converted into
       0.9 of a share of AT&T Wireless common stock.

     Cancellation of Shares.  Shares of TeleCorp capital stock owned by TeleCorp
or owned by AT&T Wireless directly, and not through a subsidiary, will be
cancelled in the merger and will not be exchanged for the merger consideration.

     Options.  All outstanding options to purchase TeleCorp common stock under
the TeleCorp option plans will automatically become options to acquire AT&T
Wireless common stock in the following manner:

     - the number of shares of AT&T Wireless common stock to be subject to the
       new option will be the product of the number of shares of TeleCorp common
       stock that were purchasable under the

       TeleCorp option immediately prior to the merger and 0.9, rounded up to
       the nearest whole number; and

     - the new exercise price will be equal to the pre-merger exercise price of
       the options divided by 0.9, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

     The options will otherwise continue to have the same terms and conditions
as they had before the merger.

     Restricted Stock.  When the merger is completed, all shares of restricted
and unvested TeleCorp common stock will automatically be converted into a number
of restricted shares of AT&T Wireless common stock equal to the product of the
number of restricted shares held by the grantee immediately before the merger
and the applicable exchange ratio. The restricted shares will otherwise continue
to have the same terms and conditions as they had before the merger. When the
merger is completed, AT&T Wireless will assume all of the obligations of
TeleCorp under the TeleCorp 1998 restricted stock plan.

     Adjustments.  If at any time during the period between the signing of the
merger agreement and the completion of the merger any change in the outstanding
shares of TeleCorp capital stock or AT&T Wireless common stock occurs by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend,
the merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders
of TeleCorp capital stock and AT&T Wireless common stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by the merger agreement. The merger consideration may
also be similarly adjusted if TeleCorp's representations concerning the extent
of its authorized and outstanding capital stock are untrue.

     Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of AT&T Wireless common stock will
be issued in the merger. Any holder of shares of TeleCorp stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of AT&T Wireless common
stock will instead receive a cash payment. The cash payment will equal the
holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale of all of the
fractional shares or, at AT&T Wireless's option, an amount equal to the value
(determined by reference to the average closing prices of AT&T Wireless common
stock on the NYSE for the ten consecutive trading days immediately following the
completion of the merger) of such fractional interest.

     Dissenting Shares.  Shares held by stockholders who neither vote in favor
of the merger nor consent thereto in writing and who demand appraisal of their
shares under applicable Delaware law will not be converted into AT&T Wireless
shares. Such stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of their shares in accordance with Delaware law. Holders of TeleCorp class
A voting common stock do not have appraisal rights.

       settlement or compromise of any material tax liability;

       after the completion of the merger;

provision of, or provide or offer any, services that are so-called "2.5G" or
"3G" or "Third Generation" services, including global system for mobile
communications/generalized packet radio service or "GSM/GPRS." TeleCorp and AT&T
Wireless have agreed to discuss at either party's request, after the expiration
or termination of any U.S. federal antitrust law waiting period, TeleCorp's
short- and long-term plans for the development and deployment of these new
services.

MEETING OF TELECORP STOCKHOLDERS AND TELECORP BOARD RECOMMENDATION

     TeleCorp has agreed to hold the special meeting as soon as practicable
after the signing of the merger agreement to obtain the approval of its
stockholders. The board of directors of TeleCorp has agreed to submit the merger
agreement to TeleCorp's stockholders, whether or not it changes, withdraws or
modifies its recommendation. Under the merger agreement, the board of directors
of TeleCorp has agreed to recommend to its stockholders that they adopt the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. However, the board
of directors of TeleCorp may withdraw or modify its recommendation if it
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
such action is required in order for the TeleCorp directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties to TeleCorp's stockholders under applicable law.

NO SOLICITATION

     TeleCorp has agreed that, except under circumstances described below, it
and its subsidiaries will not, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage any proposals, including by furnishing
       information, that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to result
       in, an acquisition proposal; or

     - have any discussion or engage in any negotiations with, or provide any
       non-public information to, any person relating to an acquisition
       proposal.

     Under the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal is a proposal or offer
regarding or indication of interest in:

     - any acquisition of a business or assets of TeleCorp or any of its
       subsidiaries that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
       or assets of TeleCorp and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

     - any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any
       class of shares of, or voting power of, TeleCorp or some of its
       subsidiaries;

     - any tender or exchange offer for the equity securities of TeleCorp that,
       if completed, would give the buyer 15% or more of any class of shares of,
       or voting power of, TeleCorp or some of its subsidiaries; or

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving TeleCorp or
       some of its subsidiaries.

     Prior to the receipt of stockholder approval at the special meeting,
TeleCorp may engage in discussions with, or provide any non-public information
to, any person or entity in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
acquisition proposal by that person or entity, if and only to the extent that:

     - TeleCorp is not otherwise in breach of the no-solicitation provisions;

     - its board of directors believes in good faith, after consulting with its
       financial advisors, that the acquisition proposal constitutes or may
       reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal;

     - its board of directors, after consultation with outside counsel,
       determines in good faith that the failure to take such action may
       constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - before providing any non-public information to, or engaging in any
       discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with
       an acquisition proposal by that person or entity, its board of directors
       receives from that person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement
       with terms no less restrictive than the comparable terms in the
       confidentiality agreement between AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp.

     Under the merger agreement, a superior proposal is a bona fide written
acquisition proposal for all of the outstanding TeleCorp capital stock, on terms
that TeleCorp's board of directors determines in its good faith judgment are
more favorable to its stockholders than the terms of the merger agreement with
AT&T Wireless.

     In addition, the merger agreement does not prevent TeleCorp from disclosing
to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer to the
extent required by federal law.

     Under the merger agreement, TeleCorp must promptly notify AT&T Wireless if
it receives any acquisition proposal and identify the person or entity making
such proposal.

FURTHER ACTIONS

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp have agreed to cooperate with one another and to
use all reasonable efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary,
proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable laws to complete
the merger. Accordingly, each has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to:

     - obtain all necessary licenses, certificates, permits, consents,
       approvals, authorizations, qualifications, and orders of governmental
       authorities and any other person;

     - effect all necessary registrations and filings; and

     - furnish to each other such information and assistance as reasonably may
       be requested in connection with the foregoing.

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts
to resolve any issues and to defeat or settle any challenges raised by
governmental authorities under federal anti-trust and communications laws.

     AT&T Wireless is not required to divest or hold separate any portion of, or
restrict or limit the operations of, any of its business or TeleCorp's business
or otherwise take action that could reasonably be expected to impair the ability
of AT&T Wireless to own and operate its business, or materially impair the
ability of AT&T Wireless to own and operate the TeleCorp business after the
merger is completed. TeleCorp may not, without AT&T Wireless's prior written
consent, commit to any divestiture or hold separate any business, and TeleCorp
will commit to take such actions if AT&T Wireless so requests in some
circumstances.

     TeleCorp has agreed to cause its subsidiaries to divest specified FCC
licenses to the extent required under FCC regulations to enable receipt of FCC
approval of the merger. These licenses are not material to TeleCorp's business.

     The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to the cooperation
between AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp in the preparation of this proxy
statement/prospectus and additional agreements between them relating to, among
other things, confidentiality, blue sky approvals, mutual notice of specified
matters, and employee benefits.

       before August 7, 2002, or March 7, 2003 if the merger has not been
       completed because the waiting period or approvals under federal antitrust
       or communication law have not expired or been terminated or received.
       However, this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be
       available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation
       under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the
       failure of the merger to be completed by such date;

     - by either AT&T Wireless or TeleCorp if the other party breaches or fails
       to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
       warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger
       agreement in such a way as to render the conditions to the completion of
       the merger contained in the merger agreement incapable of being satisfied
       before the deadlines referred to above;

       or otherwise prohibits the merger, and the injunction or prohibition

       stockholders, or if the TeleCorp board of directors approves, or
       determines to recommend to the stockholders of TeleCorp that they
       approve, an alternative acquisition proposal, or if for any reason
       TeleCorp fails to call or hold the special meeting within six months of
       the date of the merger agreement, with an exception relating to the date
       that the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus
       is a part becomes effective.

TERMINATION FEE

     The merger agreement provides for a termination fee of $65 million to be
paid by TeleCorp to AT&T Wireless in the following cases:

     - if AT&T Wireless terminates the merger agreement because TeleCorp fails
       to call or hold the TeleCorp special meeting of stockholders within six
       months after the date of the merger agreement, with an exception relating
       to the date that the registration statement of which this proxy
       statement/prospectus is a part becomes effective;

     - if either AT&T Wireless or TeleCorp terminates the merger agreement
       because the merger agreement is not adopted by the TeleCorp stockholders;
       or

     - if an alternative acquisition proposal has been made and AT&T Wireless
       terminates the merger agreement because TeleCorp has breached a closing
       condition relating to representations or covenants, and within 12 months
       of termination TeleCorp enters into a definitive agreement with respect
       to any alternative transaction or its board of directors recommends
       acceptance by the TeleCorp stockholders of a tender offer or exchange
       offer with respect to an acquisition proposal.

FEES AND EXPENSES

     Whether or not the merger is completed, with some exceptions, all expenses
and fees incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger will be
paid by the party incurring the expenses or fees, except that all expenses and
fees incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part will
be shared equally by TeleCorp and AT&T Wireless.

AMENDMENT, EXTENSION AND WAIVER

merger agreement may be waived. All amendments and waivers to the merger
agreement must be in writing signed by each party.

                                OTHER AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of several agreements
that were entered into at the same time as the merger agreement. Copies of the
voting agreements summarized below are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus and have been filed as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

     As an inducement to AT&T Wireless to enter into the merger agreement,
Gerald T. Vento, and Thomas H. Sullivan, who own approximately 51.3% of the
voting power of TeleCorp capital stock entitled to vote at the special meeting,
have entered into separate voting agreements with AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp in
which they agreed to vote all of the respective shares of TeleCorp capital stock
owned by them at the time of the special meeting in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and against proposals for other transactions.

     As an inducement to AT&T Wireless to enter into the merger agreement, some
cash equity stockholders of TeleCorp, who own approximately 10.2% of the voting
power of TeleCorp capital stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, have
entered into three separate voting agreements with AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp in
which they agreed to vote all of the respective shares of TeleCorp capital stock
owned by them at the time of the special meeting in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and against proposals for other transactions.

     Accordingly, stockholder approval of the merger is assured.

  Agreements to Vote.

     Each stockholder subject to a voting agreement agreed to vote his or its
shares in favor of the merger and against:

     - any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the
       transactions under the merger agreement;

     - any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, business combination, share
       exchange, reorganization or recapitalization of TeleCorp or any of its
       subsidiaries with or involving any other person other than as
       contemplated under the merger agreement;

     - any liquidation or winding up of TeleCorp;

     - any extraordinary dividend by TeleCorp;

     - any change in the capital structure of TeleCorp (other than under the
       merger agreement);

     - any other action that may reasonably be expected to interfere with or
       delay the completion of the merger or result in a breach of any of the
       covenants, representations, warranties or other obligations or agreements
       of TeleCorp or which would materially and adversely affect TeleCorp's or
       AT&T Wireless's ability to complete the merger; and

     - authorizing TeleCorp to seek the consent of the FCC to permit the class A
       voting common stock and voting preference common stock to vote and act as
       a single class as provided by the amended and restated certificate of
       incorporation of TeleCorp.

     In furtherance of the foregoing agreements, each stockholder subject to a
voting agreement granted to AT&T Wireless an irrevocable proxy to vote such
stockholder's shares in accordance with such agreement.

  Transfer Restrictions.

     The voting agreements executed by Messrs. Vento and Sullivan provide that,
prior to the completion of the merger, neither of them may transfer his shares
of TeleCorp voting preference common stock or sell short shares of AT&T Wireless
common stock to be received in connection with the merger. The voting

agreements do not restrict transfers by Messrs. Vento and Sullivan of shares of
other classes of TeleCorp stock owned by them; however, the restrictions with
respect to transfers of shares of such other classes of stock under the
stockholders agreement of TeleCorp remain in effect. See "The
Merger -- Interests of TeleCorp Directors and Officers in the Merger;
Relationships with AT&T Wireless."

     Subject to the exceptions noted below, the voting agreements executed by
the cash equity stockholders provide that, prior to the completion of the
merger, no stockholder may transfer its TeleCorp shares or sell short shares of
AT&T Wireless common stock to be received in connection with the merger. The
exceptions to the foregoing transfer restrictions are as follows:

     - at any time, a cash equity stockholder may transfer up to one-third of
       the shares of class A voting common stock owned of record or beneficially
       by it as of October 7, 2001;

     - commencing on the earlier of the date of the TeleCorp special meeting and
       March 31, 2002, a cash equity stockholder may transfer an additional
       one-third of the shares of class A voting common stock owned of record or
       beneficially by it as of October 7, 2001;

     - commencing on the earlier of the date of the completion of the merger and
       June 30, 2002, a cash equity stockholder may transfer the balance of the
       shares of class A voting common stock owned of record or beneficially by
       it as of October 7, 2001; and

     - at any time transfers may be made without volume limitations to
       affiliates of a cash equity stockholder or by operation of law, provided
       that the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the
       cash equity stockholder voting agreement.

     Each cash equity stockholder party to a voting agreement may assign its
transfer rights during each of the foregoing periods to another cash equity
stockholder subject to a voting agreement, thereby increasing the number of
shares which may be transferred by the assignee cash equity stockholder during
the applicable period.

  Termination.

     Except for several surviving provisions, the voting agreements executed by
the cash equity stockholders terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

     - the completion of the merger;

     - December 31, 2002;

     - the date of effectiveness of any amendment to the merger agreement that
       changes the type or amount of merger consideration in a way that is
       materially adverse to any of the cash equity stockholders party to a
       voting agreement; and

     - the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

     Except for several surviving provisions, the voting agreements executed by
Messrs. Vento and Sullivan terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

     - the completion of the merger;

     - December 31, 2002; and

     - the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT AMENDMENT

     Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the TeleCorp
stockholders agreement was amended by AT&T Wireless, TeleCorp, Messrs. Vento and
Sullivan, and at least 66 2/3% of the class A voting common stock beneficially
owned by TeleCorp's initial investors other than AT&T Wireless, to permit the
TeleCorp stockholders who are parties to the voting agreements to execute,
deliver and perform their obligations under the voting agreements.

TRANSFER AGREEMENTS

     Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, TeleCorp entered
into an agreement with a third party to provide for the transfer to such third
party of C- and F- block FCC licenses which TeleCorp owns or has agreed to
acquire and which, under applicable FCC rules, it will not be permitted to hold
following completion of the merger. These licenses are not material to
TeleCorp's business. Generally, the licenses will be transferred only if the
merger is completed. If the merger agreement is terminated, the agreement to
transfer the licenses shall also terminate. In addition, pursuant to a separate
agreement with the same third party, the rights to acquire certain licenses have
been assigned to the third party; however, TeleCorp has a call right to
purchase, at the assignee's cost, the rights to acquire the licenses, or the
actual licenses if then owned by the assignee, should the merger agreement be
terminated. If the merger agreement is terminated, and other conditions
(including TeleCorp's failure to waive its right to be the exclusive provider of
mobile wireless communications services under the AT&T Wireless brand name in
those service areas covered by licenses acquired pursuant to the assigned rights
which are then owned by the assignee) are met, the assignee has a put right with
respect to the rights to acquire the licenses, or the licenses, if then owned,
at the assignee's cost.

                   DESCRIPTION OF AT&T WIRELESS CAPITAL STOCK

     The following description of the material terms of AT&T Wireless's capital
stock does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to AT&T Wireless's amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, the certificates of designation of the AT&T Wireless series C and E
preferred stock, rights agreement and Delaware law. We have attached the
certificates of designation of the AT&T Wireless series C and E preferred stock
as Appendix B and C to this proxy statement/ prospectus. AT&T Wireless's amended
and restated certificate of incorporation, by-laws and rights agreement have
been filed with the SEC.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     AT&T Wireless's authorized capital stock consists of 1 billion shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01, and 10 billion shares of common stock, par
value $.01.

AT&T WIRELESS COMMON STOCK

     The holders of AT&T Wireless common stock have one vote per share on all
matters voted on by stockholders, including elections of directors. AT&T
Wireless's amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide
for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Subject to any preferential
rights of any outstanding series of AT&T Wireless's preferred stock created by
AT&T Wireless's board of directors from time to time, the holders of AT&T
Wireless common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from
time to time by AT&T Wireless's board of directors.

AT&T WIRELESS PREFERRED STOCK

     AT&T Wireless's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
authorizes AT&T Wireless's board of directors to establish one or more series of
preferred stock and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock,
the terms and rights of such series.

     Fifty million shares of AT&T Wireless series A junior participating
preferred stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of the rights
issued under AT&T Wireless's rights agreement. For a more complete discussion of
AT&T Wireless's rights agreement, see "-- Anti-Takeover Effects of AT&T
Wireless's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws -- Rights Agreement."

     At the completion of the merger, AT&T Wireless will designate 210,608
shares of series C preferred stock and 25,428 shares of series E preferred
stock. The rights of the series C and E preferred will be substantially
identical to the rights of TeleCorp series C preferred stock and series E
preferred stock, respectively.

     VOTING RIGHTS.  Regardless of the number of shares of any series of
preferred stock then outstanding, the holders of the series C preferred stock
and the series E preferred stock shall have the following aggregate number of
votes, in each case voting as a class with the common stock:

     - the series C preferred stock shall have 1,926,069 votes; and

     - the series E preferred stock shall have 251,189 votes.

     The number of votes to which each share of series C preferred stock and
series E preferred stock is entitled shall be determined in proportion to the
number of shares of such series of preferred stock then outstanding.

     SPECIAL VOTING RIGHTS OF PREFERRED STOCK.  The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series C preferred stock or
series E preferred stock shall be necessary to:

     - authorize, increase the authorized number of shares of or issue
       (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable
       securities or by reclassification) any shares of any class or classes or
       series of stock ranking senior to or pari passu with the series or any
       additional shares of the series;

     - authorize, adopt or approve each amendment to AT&T Wireless's amended and
       restated certificate of incorporation that would increase or decrease the
       par value of the shares of the series or alter or change the powers,
       preferences or rights of the shares of the series or alter or change the
       powers, preferences or rights of any of AT&T Wireless's other capital
       stock if such alteration or change results in such capital stock ranking
       senior to or pari passu with such series;

     - amend, alter or repeal any provision of AT&T Wireless's amended and
       restated certificate of incorporation so as to affect the shares of the
       series adversely; or

     - authorize or issue any security convertible into, exchangeable for or
       evidencing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of any
       class or classes of stock senior to or pari passu with the series.

     RANKING.  With respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the outstanding series C
preferred stock and the series E preferred stock ranks as follows:

CLASS OF STOCK      PARITY WITH       JUNIOR TO                     SENIOR TO
- --------------      -----------       ---------                     ---------

series C preferred     None              None         Common stock and any series or class
                                                      of common or preferred stock, now or
                                                      hereafter authorized
series E preferred     None       series C preferred  Common stock and any series or class
                                                      of common or preferred stock, now or
                                                      hereafter authorized (other than the
                                                      series C preferred)

     DIVIDENDS.  The holders of AT&T Wireless series C preferred stock and
series E preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends in cash or property
when, as and if, declared by the board of directors up to the liquidation
preference for such shares. So long as shares of series C or series E preferred
stock are outstanding and dividends payable on shares of series C or series E
preferred stock have not been paid in full in cash, no cash dividends may be
declared or paid, and no redemption, purchase or other acquisition for
consideration may occur, with respect to any shares of any class of common stock
or series of preferred stock ranking junior to or on parity with the series C or
series E preferred stock, except that AT&T Wireless may acquire, in accordance
with the terms of any agreement between AT&T Wireless and its employees, shares
of common stock or preferred stock at a price not greater than the market price
as of such date.

     LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  The holders of series C preferred stock and series E
preferred stock are entitled to preferences with respect to distributions upon
AT&T Wireless's liquidation, dissolution or winding up as follows:

     - a holder of series C preferred stock is entitled to a preference per
       share equal to the sum of

      - the quotient of (A) the aggregate paid-in capital actually paid with
        respect to all shares of series C preferred stock held by such holder,
        and all shares of capital stock of TeleCorp or its
        predecessors-in-interest, TeleCorp Wireless and Tritel, in each case as
        of the applicable date of determination, divided by (B) the total number
        of shares of series C preferred stock held by such holder as of such
        date and

      - accrued and unpaid dividends (if any), plus interest on the
        aforementioned quotient at the rate of 6% per annum, compounded
        quarterly, less

      - the amount of dividends (if any) already declared and paid in respect of
        such shares; and

     - a holder of series E preferred stock is entitled to a preference per
       share equal to the sum of accrued and unpaid dividends (if any), plus
       interest on $1,000 at the rate of 6% per annum, compounded

       quarterly, from the date of issuance of such share (relating back, as the
       case may be, to the original date of issuance for series E preferred
       stock received in exchange for capital stock of any
       predecessor-in-interest to TeleCorp or its subsidiaries) to and including
       the date of the calculation, less the amount of dividends (if any)
       declared and paid in respect of such share.

     REDEMPTION.  AT&T Wireless has the right to redeem shares of series C
preferred stock and series E preferred stock at any time, in whole but not in
part, at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference per
share; provided, that if the funds legally available are insufficient to effect
the redemption in full of the series C preferred stock or the series E preferred
stock, as the case may be, such funds shall be allocated among the shares of
such series ratably in accordance with the number of shares of such series
outstanding as of the redemption date.

     Following December 13, 2020, each holder of shares of series C preferred
stock and series E preferred stock shall have the right, at the election of such
holder, to require AT&T Wireless to redeem all (but not less than all) of the
shares of such series owned by such holder at a price per share equal to the
liquidation preference of such series as of the redemption date.

     Neither AT&T Wireless nor any holder of shares of series C preferred stock
or series E preferred stock may cause AT&T Wireless to redeem its capital stock
if, at the time:

     - AT&T Wireless is insolvent or the redemption will render AT&T Wireless
       insolvent; or

     - any law or any of AT&T Wireless's agreements prohibits the redemption.

     Further, AT&T Wireless will not permit any of AT&T Wireless's subsidiaries,
or any other person, to make any distribution with respect to, or purchase or
otherwise acquire for consideration, any shares of AT&T Wireless's common stock
or other shares of capital stock ranking junior to or on parity with the series
C preferred stock or the series E preferred stock, as the case may be, unless
AT&T Wireless could make such distribution or purchase or otherwise acquire such
shares at such time without becoming insolvent, violating any law, or defaulting
under, breaching or violating any of AT&T Wireless's agreements.

ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF AT&T WIRELESS'S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS

  Board of Directors

     AT&T Wireless's directors are classified into three classes, as nearly
equal in number as possible.

     Subject to the rights of any class or series of preferred stock having the
right under a preferred stock designation to elect directors under specified
circumstances, no director may be removed from office except for cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all voting stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class.

  No Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings

     AT&T Wireless's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
by-laws provide that stockholders must effect any action required or permitted
to be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and that
those actions may not be effected by any consent in writing by the stockholders.
Except as otherwise required by law or by any preferred stock designation,
special meetings of stockholders may be called only by a majority of the whole
board or by the chairman of the board. No business other than that stated in the
notice of meeting may be transacted at any special meeting. These provisions may
have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the
next annual meeting unless a special meeting is called by a majority of the
whole board or the chairman of the board.

  Advance Notice Procedures

     AT&T Wireless's by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for
stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring other
business before an annual meeting of stockholders. These stockholder notice
procedures also provide that only persons who are nominated by AT&T Wireless's
board of directors, or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the
time of giving notice and has given timely written notice to AT&T Wireless's
secretary before the meeting at which directors are to be elected, will be
eligible for election as directors.

  Rights Agreement

     AT&T Wireless's board of directors has adopted a rights agreement. Under
the rights agreement, AT&T Wireless has issued one preferred share purchase
right for each outstanding share of AT&T Wireless's common stock. Each right
will entitle the registered holder to purchase from AT&T Wireless one
one-hundredth of a share of AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, at a price of $100, per one
one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment in some circumstances.

     The purpose of the rights agreement is to encourage potential acquirers to
negotiate with the AT&T Wireless board of directors before attempting a takeover
bid and to provide the AT&T Wireless board of directors with leverage in
negotiating on behalf of the AT&T Wireless stockholders the terms of any
proposed takeover. The rights agreement may have anti-takeover effects. It
should not, however, interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the AT&T Wireless board of directors.

     The rights will be evidenced by the certificates representing AT&T
Wireless's common stock until the "distribution date," which is defined as the
earlier to occur of:

     - ten days following a public announcement that a person or group of
       affiliated or associated persons, with specified persons and categories
       of persons excepted, has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
       the outstanding shares of AT&T Wireless's common stock (such person or
       group, an "acquiring person"); or

     - ten business days or a later date determined by AT&T Wireless's board of
       directors following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
       the completion of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a
       person or group, with specified persons and categories of persons
       excepted, of 15% or more of such outstanding shares of AT&T Wireless's
       common stock (such person or group, an "acquiring person").

     The rights agreement exempts DoCoMo's ownership of more than 15% of AT&T
Wireless's common stock, but only to the extent of the shares of AT&T Wireless's
common stock that DoCoMo owns as a result of its January 22, 2001 investment in
AT&T Wireless and any shares of common stock that DoCoMo could purchase as a
result of its investment rights.

     The rights agreement provides that, until the distribution date, the rights
will be transferred with and only with AT&T Wireless's common stock.

     The rights will not be exercisable until the distribution date. The rights
will expire on July 9, 2010, unless the final expiration date is extended or
unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by AT&T Wireless, in each
case, as summarized below.

     In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons
becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a right, other than rights
beneficially owned by the acquiring person, which will thereafter be void, will
have the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of AT&T Wireless's
common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.
If AT&T Wireless is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction or 50% or more of AT&T Wireless's consolidated assets or earning
power are sold after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a right will thereafter have the
right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price
of the right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring

company which at the time of the transaction will have a market value of two
times the exercise price of the right.

     At any time after the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of AT&T Wireless's
outstanding common stock and before the acquisition by the person or group of
50% or more of AT&T Wireless's outstanding common stock, AT&T Wireless's board
of directors may exchange the rights, other than rights owned by the person or
group which, have become void, in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one
share of AT&T Wireless's common stock, or one one-hundredth of one of AT&T
Wireless's junior preferred shares, or of a share of a class or series of
preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges, per right
subject to adjustment.

     At any time before any person becomes an acquiring person, AT&T Wireless's
board of directors may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price
of $.01 per right, as adjusted. The redemption of the rights may be made
effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as AT&T
Wireless's board of directors, in its sole discretion, may establish.
Immediately upon any redemption of the rights, the right to exercise the rights
will terminate and the only right that the holders of the rights will be
eligible to receive will be the redemption price.

     The terms of the rights may be amended by AT&T Wireless's board of
directors without the consent of the holders of the rights; provided, however,
that AT&T Wireless's board may not reduce the threshold at which a person or
group becomes an acquiring person to below 10% of AT&T Wireless's outstanding
common stock, and from and after such time as any person or group of affiliated
or associated persons becomes an acquiring person, no amendment may adversely
affect the interests of the holders of the rights.

     Until a right is exercised, the holder of that right, as a holder, will
have no additional rights as AT&T Wireless's stockholder solely by virtue of
holding that right, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to
receive dividends.

     The number of outstanding rights and the number of one one-hundredths of
AT&T Wireless's junior preferred shares issuable upon exercise of each right
also will be subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of AT&T
Wireless's common stock or a stock dividend on AT&T Wireless's common stock
payable in AT&T Wireless's common stock or subdivisions, consolidations or
combinations of AT&T Wireless's common stock occurring, in any case, before the
distribution date.

     The purchase price payable, and the number of shares of capital stock
issuable, upon exercise of the rights will be subject to adjustment from time to
time to prevent dilution:

     - in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or
       reclassification of, AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating
       preferred shares;

     - upon the grant to holders of AT&T Wireless's junior preferred shares of
       rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase AT&T Wireless's series A
       junior participating preferred shares at a price, or securities
       convertible into AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating preferred
       shares with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price
       of AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating preferred shares; or

     - upon the distribution to holders of AT&T Wireless's series A junior
       participating preferred shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets
       (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in AT&T
       Wireless's series A junior participating preferred shares) or of
       subscription rights or warrants other than those to purchase series A
       junior participating preferred shares.

     With some exceptions, no adjustment in the purchase price will be required
until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in the
purchase price. No fractional junior preferred shares will be issued, other than
fractions that are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of one of AT&T
Wireless's junior preferred shares, which may, at AT&T Wireless's election, be
evidenced by depositary receipts and instead, an adjustment in cash will be made
based on the market price of AT&T Wireless's junior preferred shares on the last
trading day before the date of exercise.

     AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating preferred shares purchasable
upon exercise of the rights will not be redeemable. Each of AT&T Wireless's
series A junior participating preferred shares will be entitled to a minimum
preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share but will be entitled
to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per share of AT&T
Wireless's common stock. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
the holders of AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating preferred shares
will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share
but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per
share of common stock. Each of AT&T Wireless's series A junior participating
preferred shares is entitled to 100 votes voting together with AT&T Wireless's
common stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in
which shares of common stock are exchanged, each one of AT&T Wireless's series A
junior participating preferred shares will be entitled to receive 100 times the
amount received per share of common stock. These rights are protected by
customary anti-dilution provisions.

     Due to the nature of AT&T Wireless's junior preferred shares' dividend,
liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in
one of AT&T Wireless's junior preferred shares purchasable upon exercise of each
right should approximate the value of one share of common stock.

     The rights have anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial
dilution to a person or group of persons that attempts to acquire AT&T Wireless
on terms not approved by its board of directors. The rights should not interfere
with any merger or other business combination approved by AT&T Wireless's board
before the time that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15%
percent or more of the common stock since the rights may be redeemed by AT&T
Wireless at the redemption price.

  Delaware Business Combinations Statute

     Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject
to some exceptions, an interested stockholder of a Delaware corporation shall
not engage in any business combination, including mergers or consolidations or
acquisitions of additional shares of the corporation, with the corporation for a
three-year period following the date that the stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder unless:

     - before the date of the business combination, the board of directors of
       the corporation approved either the business combination or the
       transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
       stockholder;

     - upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an "interested stockholder," the interested stockholder owned at
       least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
       the transaction commenced, excluding some shares; or

     - on or after that date, the business combination is approved by the board
       of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special
       meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of
       the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested
       stockholder.

     Except as otherwise specified in Section 203, an interested stockholder is
defined to include:

     - any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting
       stock of the corporation, or is an affiliate or associate of the
       corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting
       stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately
       before the date of determination; and

     - the affiliates and associates of the stockholder.

     Under some circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for an
interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a
corporation for a three-year period. AT&T Wireless has not elected to be exempt
from the restrictions imposed under Section 203.

                     COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF AT&T WIRELESS
                           AND TELECORP STOCKHOLDERS

     AT&T Wireless and TeleCorp are both organized under the laws of Delaware.
Accordingly, differences in the rights of holders of AT&T Wireless capital stock
and holders of TeleCorp capital stock arise primarily from differences in their
respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws. Upon completion of the
merger, holders of TeleCorp capital stock will become holders of AT&T Wireless
capital stock and their rights will be governed by Delaware law and AT&T
Wireless's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The
following table describes some of the material differences between the rights of
AT&T Wireless stockholders and TeleCorp stockholders. This summary does not
include a complete description of all of the differences among the
