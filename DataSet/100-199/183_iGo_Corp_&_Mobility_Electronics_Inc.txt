Dear Stockholders:

     The boards of directors of Mobility Electronics, Inc., and iGo Corporation
have agreed to merge iGo with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobility.
Before we can complete this merger, the merger and the agreement and plan of
merger entered into between Mobility and iGo must be approved by iGo's
stockholders. Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon consummation of the
transaction, the separate existence of iGo will cease and the merger subsidiary
will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobility. We are sending you the
attached Notice of Special Stockholders' Meeting and proxy statement/prospectus
to ask you to vote in favor of the merger and merger agreement.

     The attached proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed
information about Mobility, iGo and the proposed merger, and includes a copy of
the merger agreement attached as Appendix A. Before voting, we strongly
encourage you to carefully read the entire proxy statement/prospectus,
particularly the section entitled "RISK FACTORS" beginning on page 10, as well
as the merger agreement.

     It is important that your shares be represented and voted regardless of the
number of shares you own and whether or not you plan to attend the stockholders'
meeting. Accordingly, we urge you to mark, sign and return your proxy card.
Approval of the merger and merger agreement requires that the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of iGo common stock affirmatively
vote "FOR" approval.

     We are very enthusiastic about the merger with Mobility. We urge you to
join our directors in voting in favor of the merger and merger agreement.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                                 /s/ SCOTT SHACKELTON

     The board of directors of iGo Corporation has scheduled a special meeting
of stockholders of iGo for the purpose of approving the agreement and plan of
merger, pursuant to which iGo will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Mobility Electronics, Inc. iGo's special stockholders' meeting will be held
on           , 2002 at                     .m., local time, at the Residence Inn
by Marriott located at 9845 Gateway Drive, Reno, Nevada 89511. You are cordially
invited to attend the special meeting; however, because you may not be able to
attend, a proxy is enclosed, which authorizes someone else to vote your shares
of iGo common stock for you.

     This document is both a proxy statement of iGo and a prospectus of
Mobility. As a proxy statement, iGo is providing it to you because iGo's board
of directors is soliciting your proxy for use at the special meeting of
stockholders called to vote on the merger and merger agreement. As a prospectus,
Mobility is providing it to you because Mobility is offering in the aggregate up
to 3,100,000 shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value, in addition to cash,
for all of the outstanding shares of iGo common stock if the merger is
completed.

     iGo and Mobility entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated as of
March 23, 2002. A copy of that agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Under the terms of the merger agreement, iGo will merge
with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobility, referred to as the merger
subsidiary. The holders of iGo common stock will be entitled to receive in the
aggregate (i) up to 3,100,000 shares of Mobility common stock, (ii) up to
$6,100,000 in cash and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, which aggregate
amount of consideration will be allocated among the holders of iGo common stock
pro rata based on the number of shares held by any holder as compared to the
total number of shares of iGo common stock issued and outstanding at the
effective time of the merger. Pursuant to the merger agreement, 500,000 shares
of Mobility common stock and $1,000,000 of the cash consideration will be held
back as contingent consideration by Mobility until the first anniversary of the
effective time of the merger. A formula set forth in the merger agreement will
then be applied to determine what portion, if any, of the held back
consideration will be distributed pro rata to the former iGo stockholders.

     The shares of common stock of Mobility and iGo are quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbols "MOBE" and "IGOC," respectively.
On           , 2002, the average of the high and low prices for the common stock
of Mobility was $           .

     SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 10 FOR A
DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN FACTORS THAT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING
HOW TO VOTE.

     Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the
accuracy or adequacy of this proxy statement/prospectus. Any representation to
the contrary is a criminal offense.

     This proxy statement/prospectus is dated          , 2002 and was first
mailed to stockholders on or about           , 2002.

                        CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING
                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This document might contain forward-looking statements about Mobility and
iGo, including one or more of the following:

     - Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, capital
       expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items;

     - Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations,
       products or services;

     - Forecasts of future economic performance; and

     - Descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the
       foregoing.

     Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts.
Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements
often include words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect,"
"intend," "plan," "project," "target," "can," "could," "may," "should," "will"
or similar expressions.

     You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They are
expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus in the case of
forward-looking statements contained in this document. Neither Mobility or iGo
undertakes any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect
changes that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

     There are several factors, many of which are beyond the control of Mobility
and iGo, that could cause results to differ from expectations. Some of these
factors are described in this document as well as in Mobility's and iGo's
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including their
respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. See
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 128 for instructions on how to
obtain copies of these documents.

                                 corporation recently formed by Mobility for use
                                 in the merger. This is the only business of

                                   THE MERGER

FORM OF MERGER (PAGE 35)

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in
accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, iGo will
merge with and into a subsidiary of Mobility. The merger subsidiary will survive
the merger, the separate existence of iGo will cease and the stockholders of iGo
will become stockholders of Mobility.

MERGER CONSIDERATION (PAGE 39)

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
iGo common stock will be cancelled, and in consideration therefore, the holders
of iGo common stock will be entitled to receive in the aggregate (i) up to
3,100,000 shares of Mobility common stock, (ii) up to $6,100,000 in cash and
(iii) cash in

lieu of any fractional shares. Pursuant to the merger agreement, 500,000 shares
of Mobility common stock and $1,000,000 of the cash consideration shall be held
back as contingent consideration by Mobility until the first anniversary of the
effective time of the merger. A formula set forth in the merger agreement will
then be applied to determine what portion, if any, of the held back
consideration shall be distributed pro rata to the former iGo stockholders.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (PAGES 42 TO 43)

     Mobility's and iGo's obligations to complete the merger are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the following:

     - iGo stockholders must approve the merger;

     - no court order or law can be in effect that prohibits the merger or makes
       the merger illegal;

     - all consents and regulatory approvals have been obtained;

     - the issuance of the Mobility common stock as part of the merger
       consideration must be registered with the Securities and Exchange
       Commission and approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market;

     - each of iGo and Mobility must certify to the other that its
       representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement are
       materially true and accurate; each must also certify to the other that it
       has materially performed all of its obligations under the merger
       agreement;

     - iGo shall have terminated all of its option plans and all other options,
       warrants or convertible securities; and

     - iGo shall have filed its Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2001,
       and the financial statements contained therein shall meet certain
       conditions (as of April 24, 2002, Mobility and iGo have agreed in writing
       that this condition precedent has been satisfied).

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT; TERMINATION FEE (PAGES 43 TO 44)

     Mobility and iGo can agree to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger, and either company can terminate the merger agreement if
any of the following occurs:

     - a court order prohibits the merger;

     - the merger is not completed by August 31, 2002;

     - iGo's stockholders fail to approve the merger; or

     - a party breaches any representation, covenant or agreement in the merger
       agreement and such breach would permit the other party not to consummate
       the merger, and such breach is not capable of being cured within 20 days
       of written notice of the breach.

     iGo may terminate the merger agreement if the thirty-trading-day or
ten-trading-day average price of the Mobility common stock for the period ending
two days prior to the effective time of the merger is below $1.00, unless
Mobility agrees to decrease the hold back amount by an amount equal to 3,100,000
multiplied by the difference between $1.00 and the average closing price of the
Mobility common stock for either the thirty-trading-day or ten-trading-day
periods described above or as otherwise agreed by Mobility and iGo.

     Mobility may terminate the merger agreement if either of the following
occurs:

     - the iGo board fails to promptly mail the proxy materials for the special
       meeting or withdraws or adversely modifies its approval or recommendation
       of the merger; or

     - iGo violates its "no shop" agreement.

     If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,
including if iGo accepts or consummates certain alternative transactions within
eighteen (18) months of the termination of the merger agreement, iGo will be
required to pay Mobility a termination fee equal to $1.5 million plus Mobility's
out-of-

pocket expenses for this transaction. See "The Merger Agreement -- Termination
Fee" for a complete discussion of the circumstances in which iGo would be
required to pay the termination fee.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 37)

     Mobility's board of directors believes that the two companies complement
each other by providing a well-established distribution channel for Mobility
products and the opportunity to sell iGo's products in Europe. Consequently,
Mobility perceives opportunities for increased operating efficiencies through
the combination of the two companies and believes that, by combining forces,
Mobility and iGo will be able to more effectively compete and more successfully
take advantage of opportunities in the mobile technology industry than either of
the companies could individually.

     Consequently, the merger is intended to serve the following purposes:

     - broaden the combined entities' geographic bases;

     - increase market share for iGo's products in Europe;

     - provide an alternative distribution channel and access to additional
       customers for Mobility's products; and

     - enhance stockholder value by achieving certain cost savings from
       increased efficiencies.

     The iGo board of directors believes that the merger is in the best
interests of iGo and its stockholders. In reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement, the iGo board considered a number of factors, including the
following:

     - the changing technological and competitive environment in the mobile
       technology industry;

     - the accelerating trend towards consolidation in the mobile technology
       industry;

     - the synergies available to Mobility in cost efficiencies on a
       consolidated basis compared to iGo continuing to operate as a separate
       company;

     - access to greater financial and technical resources in support of the
       goals of iGo;

     - the risk that iGo would not have the resources to timely execute its
       business plan when compared to its existing and potential competitors;

     - the opportunity for iGo stockholders to participate in a more
       commercially diversified company such as the combined companies following
       the merger;

     - information relating to iGo's prospects, including the possibility that
       iGo may be required to raise additional capital to attempt to create
       stockholder value in excess of the merger consideration;

     - the Mobility offer represented a premium over the price of iGo stock when
       the merger agreement was executed;

     - the market capitalization, revenues and assets of the combined companies
       as compared to iGo separately;

     - the experience, depth and competence of Mobility's operating team;

     - the strength of Mobility's product development efforts;

     - that iGo may, subject to the merger agreement, terminate the agreement if
       the 30 or 10 day trading average price of the Mobility common stock for
       the period ending two days prior to the effective date of the merger is
       below $1.00 and Mobility does not make certain adjustments in the
       transaction consideration;

     - the willingness of certain iGo stockholders to execute a voting agreement
       in support of the merger and the fact that Mobility was unwilling to sign
       the merger agreement without the voting agreement; and

     - that the amount of and circumstances giving rise to the termination fee
       under the merger agreement was acceptable in the judgment of iGo in light
       of the value of the merger consideration to iGo's stockholders.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE iGo BOARD (PAGE 34)

     The iGo board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and unanimously
recommends that you vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger and
the merger agreement.

PURPOSES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 33)

     The purposes of the special meeting are to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, and such
other business as may properly be brought before the special meeting.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER AND STOCK OWNERSHIP BY DIRECTORS AND
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF iGo (PAGES 38 TO 39 AND 126 TO 128)

     In determining how to vote at the special meeting, you should be aware that
certain officers and directors of iGo may have interests in the merger that are
different from the interests of other stockholders. Indemnification obligations
that iGo provides to its directors and executive officers will survive the
merger and become obligations of Mobility. Unvested stock options held by
directors and executive officers of iGo will automatically and fully vest before
the effective date of the merger. Certain executive officers of iGo have been
offered employment with the surviving corporation.

     As of March 31, 2002, all executive officers and directors of iGo, as a
group, owned approximately 19.9% of the shares of iGo stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting.

THE LOCK-UP AND VOTING AGREEMENT (PAGE 44)

     Holders of approximately 33.9% of the outstanding shares of iGo common
stock have entered into a lock-up and voting agreement with Mobility in which
they have agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (PAGE 45)

     Under Delaware law, iGo stockholders do not have any right to an appraisal
of the value of their shares in connection with the issuance of shares in the
merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGES 45 TO 49)

     The tax consequences of the merger will depend to a large extent on the
price of the Mobility common stock at the effective time. In order for the
merger to constitute a "reorganization" as defined in Section 368(a) of the
Code, "continuity of interest" must be present in the merger. Continuity of
interest in general is a function of the portion of your iGo common stock
exchanged for Mobility common stock in the merger, based upon the price of the
Mobility common stock, probably at the effective time.

     Jackson Walker, L.L.P., counsel to Mobility, has issued an opinion that the
merger will not be a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code.
This opinion is based upon certain representations and assumptions, including
that the price of Mobility common stock at the effective time is $1.58 and that
the stock subject to the hold back is valued at $1.58 per share and along with
the cash in the hold back is taken into account in the continuity of interest
calculation as non-stock consideration.

     If the merger is not a reorganization it will likely be treated as if iGo
sold all of its assets to Mobility in a taxable transaction, and iGo
subsequently distributed to its stockholders all stock and cash received in the

merger. Accordingly, iGo stockholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between (i) the cash and the value of the Mobility common stock
received by them, and (ii) their tax basis in their shares of iGo.

     If the merger is considered a reorganization, iGo stockholders will not
recognize gain immediately on the Mobility common stock received in the merger,
other than stock that is subject to the hold back; however all cash received in
the merger and any stock under the hold back will be taxable to you.

     If any property is distributed from the hold back, a portion of the
property will be considered interest.

     The tax treatment of iGo stockholders is more fully described in "The
Merger -- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" herein.
The above should not be considered tax advice and it is qualified in its
entirety by the discussion in "The Merger -- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger". You are urged to consult your own tax advisor
regarding the tax consequences of the merger upon you.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 49)

     The merger will be treated as a purchase and, as such, the purchase price
will be allocated to the assets and liabilities of iGo based on their estimated
fair market values on the date of acquisition.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS (PAGES 50 TO 53)

     There are material differences between the rights of holders of iGo common
stock and the rights of holders of Mobility common stock. These differences
arise because of differing provisions in the iGo certificate of incorporation
and bylaws and the Mobility certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

RISK FACTORS (PAGES 10 TO 30)

     There are risk factors that should be considered by you in evaluating how
to vote at the special meeting, including the following.

     Risks related to the merger include:

     - the benefits of the proposed combination may not be realized, which would
       likely cause Mobility's stock price to decline;

     - iGo's stockholders may not receive all or any of the held back
       consideration;

     - iGo stockholders' voting power will be diluted and the book value per
       share of Mobility's common stock received by iGo stockholders is subject
       to fluctuation;

     - it is unlikely that the merger agreement will not be approved;

     - officers and directors of iGo have potential conflicts of interest with
       respect to the merger; and

     - third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts with iGo.

     Risks related to Mobility include:

     - Mobility has a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future;

     - Mobility may not achieve anticipated revenues if market acceptance of
       their Split Bridge(R) technology is not forthcoming;

     - Mobility's operating results are subject to significant fluctuations, and
       an unanticipated decline in revenues may cause their stock price to fall;

     - Mobility may not be able to adequately manage their anticipated growth,
       which could impair their efficiency and negatively impact our operations;

     - Mobility's failure to respond to rapid technological changes may impair
       their operating results;

     - Mobility depends on large purchases from a few significant customers, and
       any loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could
       cause a shortfall in revenue;

     - Mobility's reliance on single or limited sources for key components may
       inhibit their ability to meet customer demand;

     - Mobility's reliance on third-party manufacturing vendors to manufacture
       our products may cause a delay in their ability to fill orders;

     - Mobility's success depends in part upon sales to OEMs, whose
       unpredictable demands and requirements may subject them to potential
       adverse revenue fluctuations;

     - Mobility has in the past experienced returns of their products, and as
       their business grows they may experience increased returns, which could
       harm their reputation and negatively impact their operating results;

     - intense competition in the market for connectivity products could prevent
       Mobility from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability;

     - if Mobility is unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary
       or if they lose key personnel, they may not be able to successfully
       manage their business or achieve their objectives;

     - if Mobility's products contain undetected software or hardware errors,
       they could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be
       subject to product liability claims;

     - if Mobility fails to protect their intellectual property, their business
       and ability to compete could suffer;

     - Mobility may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that
       are costly to defend and could limit their ability to use certain
       technologies in the future;

     - Mobility's ability to increase international sales and manage its
       international operations is subject to a number of risks beyond its
       capital;

     - Mobility's executive officers and directors have substantial control over
       the business which could delay or prevent a merger or other change in
       control of Mobility;

     - Mobility's stock price may be extremely volatile and you may lose part or
       all of the value of your shares.

     Risks related to iGo include:

     - iGo has a limited operating history on which to evaluate its potential
       for future success;

     - iGo has a history of losses and expects losses for at least the next
       several quarters;

     - iGo may not have sufficient capital to reach profitability;

     - if iGo's shares are delisted, its stock price may decline further and it
       may be unable to raise additional capital;

     - although iGo is aware of no determinations, concerns regarding the SEC
       investigation could harm its business;

     - iGo's stock price may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations
       in its quarterly operating results;

     - strengthening the iGo, Road Warrior and Xtend brands is critical to iGo's
       success;

     - iGo depends on key personnel to manage its business, and iGo may not be
       able to hire enough additional management and other personnel as its
       business grows;

     - competition may decrease iGo's market share, net revenues and gross
       margins and may cause its stock price to decline;

     - the loss of iGo's proprietary databases would seriously harm its
       business;

     - the failure to successfully grow, manage and use iGo's database of
       customers and users would harm its business;

     - failure of iGo's strategic relationships to attract customers could harm
       its business;

     - iGo must effectively manage its inventory and improve its gross margins;

     - failure of third party suppliers to ship products directly to iGo's
       customers could harm its business;

     - failure of third-party carriers to deliver iGo's products timely and
       consistently could harm its business;

     - iGo may not be able to protect and enforce its trademarks, Internet
       addresses and intellectual property rights;

     - iGo may be vulnerable to new tax obligations that could be imposed on
       electronic commerce transactions;

     - if iGo expands its business internationally, iGo's business would become
       increasingly susceptible to numerous international risks and challenges
       that could affect its results of operations;

     - any acquisitions iGo makes could disrupt its business and harm its
       financial condition;

     - the loss of technologies licensed from third parties could harm iGo's
       business;

     - iGo's business, financial condition and results of operations could be
       harmed if it were to be liable for defects in the products it offers; and

     - damage to or destruction of iGo's warehouse could result in loss of its
       inventory, which could harm its business, financial condition and results
       of operations.

     - iGo is dependent on the continued development of the Internet
       infrastructure;

     - a portion of iGo's long-term success depends on the development of the
       electronic commerce market, which is uncertain;

     - rapid technological change could render iGo's websites and systems
       obsolete and require significant capital expenditures;

     - iGo is exposed to risks associated with electronic commerce security and
       credit card fraud, which may reduce collections and discourage online
       transactions;

     - iGo could face liability for information displayed on and communications
       through its website;

     - efforts to regulate or eliminate the use of mechanisms that automatically
       collect information on visitors to iGo's website may interfere with iGo's
       ability to target its marketing efforts; and

     - iGo could face additional burdens associated with government regulation
       of and legal uncertainties surrounding the Internet.

     Cost of goods sold and gross profit were adversely impacted in 2001 by
additional inventory write-downs related to the transition of iGo's product
strategy toward higher margin accessory products, as well as normal write-downs
for excess or obsolete product inventory. The additional write-downs related to
the transition of iGo's product strategy amounted to approximately $3.3 million.
In addition, iGo recorded a write-down of goodwill of approximately $9.5 million
during the fourth quarter of 2001, which is included in merger and acquisition
costs.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider
the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this
proxy statement/prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of
Mobility common stock. Any of the following risks could cause the trading price
of the Mobility common stock to decline.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

 THE BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED COMBINATION MAY NOT BE REALIZED, WHICH WOULD
 LIKELY CAUSE MOBILITY'S STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.

     If we complete the merger, we may be unable to realize the expected
benefits of combining Mobility and iGo, which would cause Mobility's business,
financial condition, and prospects to be materially and adversely affected. A
principal difficulty the combined company will face will be attempting to
integrate two companies that have previously operated independently. Integrating
Mobility's operations and personnel with those of iGo will be a complex process.
Mobility may not be able to integrate the operations of iGo with its operations
rapidly or without encountering difficulties. It is important that this
integration is accomplished as rapidly as possible, as iGo is currently
experiencing substantial operating losses. These losses, together with our
current operating losses, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow
and availability. The successful integration of Mobility with iGo will require,
among other things, integration of iGo's and Mobility's research and development
efforts, product offerings, sales and marketing operations and information and
software systems, the coordination of employee retention and hiring, and
training operations. The diversion of management's attention to the integration
efforts, the costs of such efforts, and any difficulties encountered in
combining operations could adversely affect the combined company's businesses
and results of operations. Further, the process of combining Mobility and iGo
could negatively affect employee morale and the ability of Mobility to retain
some of iGo's key personnel after the merger. Also, Mobility could face
additional risks inherent in iGo's business that Mobility was not previously
subject to. For example, the additional requirements that Mobility may have in
the future to fund its operations could be significantly increased due to the
capital requirements of iGo's business. Mobility also may be subject to
increased liability with respect to intellectual property matters or other
matters relating to the prior business of iGo.

     Other factors that could cause the combined company not to realize the
benefits described in "Reasons for the Merger" on page 37 include the following:

     - potentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies;

     - geographic dispersion of operations;

     - expected synergy benefits from the merger, such as lower costs, may not
       be realized or may be realized more slowly than anticipated;

     - difficulties in integrating the product offerings and the sales and
       marketing efforts of the two companies;

     - the difficulty of leveraging iGo's and Mobility's combined technologies
       and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases; and

     - loss of key customers and suppliers as a result of the merger.

  IGO STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT RECEIVE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE HELD BACK
CONSIDERATION.

     A significant portion of the potential merger consideration will be held
back and paid to the iGo stockholders one year following the effective date of
the merger closing based on a formula that takes into account post-closing sales
of iGo inventory and collections of iGo accounts receivable as of the effective
date of the merger, as well as certain potential liabilities above threshold
amounts. Because several of these items are based on the outcome of events to be
determined following the effective date, the amount of the held back
consideration to be distributed to the iGo stockholders, if any, is inherently
uncertain. iGo stockholders should

not expect to receive all, and they may not receive any, of the held back
consideration. For additional information, please read the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement -- Hold-Back Provisions."

  IGO STOCKHOLDERS' VOTING POWER WILL BE DILUTED AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE
  MOBILITY COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY IGO STOCKHOLDERS IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION.

     iGo stockholders will have their voting power diluted as a result of the
merger. Additionally, the equivalent book value per share of the market value of
the Mobility common stock they receive in exchange for iGo common stock in the
merger is subject to fluctuation. iGo's stockholders now own 100% of iGo. After
the merger, iGo's stockholders will own approximately 16% of Mobility's total
shares outstanding.

  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE APPROVED.

     The affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
iGo common stock entitled to vote is required to approve the merger agreement.
Certain stockholders of iGo have executed a lock-up and voting agreement
requiring each of them to vote in favor of the merger. These stockholders own
approximately 33.9% of iGo's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a
result, it is unlikely that the merger and the merger agreement will not be
approved.

  OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF IGO HAVE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE
MERGER.

     iGo stockholders should be aware of potential conflicts of interest and the
benefits available to iGo officers and directors when considering the adoption
and approval of the merger and the merger agreement by the iGo board of
directors and its recommendation to iGo stockholders to approve the merger and
the merger agreement. For example, certain iGo executive officers have
employment agreements that provide them with interests in iGo that are different
from, and in addition to, interests of iGo stockholders generally, including
under certain circumstances the right to severance benefits in the event the
employment of such officers is terminated. Certain executive officers of iGo
have been offered continuing employment with the surviving corporation. The
merger agreement also provides for continuing indemnification of officers and
directors of iGo after the effective date of the merger. In addition, the
current directors and certain executive officers of iGo have entered into a
lock-up and voting agreement with Mobility that, among other things, requires
these directors and executive officers to vote their iGo shares in support of
the merger. As a result, iGo officers and directors may have interests in the
transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other
iGo stockholders. For additional information, please read the section entitled
"The Merger -- Interests of iGo's Board of Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger."

  THIRD PARTIES MAY TERMINATE OR ALTER EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH IGO.

     iGo has contracts with some of its suppliers, distributors, customers,
licensors and other business partners. Certain of these contracts will require
iGo to obtain a consent from these other parties in connection with the offer or
the merger. If their consent cannot be obtained, these contracts may be
terminated and iGo may suffer a loss of potential future revenue and may lose
rights to facilities or intellectual property that are material to iGo's
business and the business, prospects, and financial condition of the combined
company.

                      RISKS RELATED TO MOBILITY'S BUSINESS

  MOBILITY HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE.

     Mobility has experienced significant operating losses since inception and,
as of December 31, 2001, has an accumulated deficit of approximately $81.6
million. If Mobility does not achieve continued revenue growth sufficient to
absorb its recent and planned expenditures, Mobility could experience additional
losses in future periods, including the remainder of 2002. These losses or
fluctuations in its operating results could cause the market value of its common
stock to decline.

     Mobility anticipates that in the future it will make significant
investments in its operations, particularly to support technological
developments and sales activities and, that as a result, operating expenses will
continue

to increase. Mobility intends to make such investments on an ongoing basis,
primarily from cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary,
funds available from our lines of credit, as it develops and introduces new
products and expand into new markets such as international, direct and OEM
markets. If total revenue does not increase with capital or other investments,
Mobility is likely to continue to incur net losses and its financial condition
could be materially adversely affected. Mobility has not yet achieved
profitability, and there can be no assurance that it will achieve or sustain
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

  MOBILITY MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED REVENUES IF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS
  SPLIT BRIDGE(R) TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS IS NOT FORTHCOMING.

     From 1998 through 2001, Mobility invested substantial resources in
developing its Split Bridge(R) technology and its Split Bridge(R)-based
universal docking stations, which have only recently been introduced into the
notebook computer market. The market for docking stations is characterized by
ongoing technological developments, frequent new product announcements and
introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements.
As a result, Mobility cannot be sure its Split Bridge(R) technology and
universal docking stations will achieve widespread market acceptance. To date,
the sales cycle on its Split Bridge(R) universal docking stations has been
longer than anticipated, and sales have been lower than expected. If Mobility
does not achieve widespread market acceptance of these products, it may not
achieve anticipated revenues. Although peripheral component interface, or PCI,
is an industry standard, the operating systems and peripheral devices used by
its customers may not be compatible with its universal docking stations and, as
a result, the available market for its products may be limited.

     The success of Mobility's Split Bridge(R) technology and universal docking
stations also depends in large part on the existence and continued growth of
market demand for universal connectivity stations. There can be no assurance
that the market or demand for universal connectivity stations, if any, will
develop and continue to grow. Any failure of this market to develop or continue
to grow or the failure of Mobility's universal docking stations to satisfy a
market need or to work with all computer makes and models could have a material
adverse affect on Mobility. In addition, demand for Mobility's products is
primarily driven by the underlying market demand for portable computers. Should
the growth in demand for portable computers be inhibited, Mobility may not
achieve anticipated revenues.

     Mobility's ability to generate future revenues from its Split Bridge(R)
technology and products also depends upon, among other factors:

     - computer OEM acceptance of its Split Bridge(R) technology and products;

     - the level of product technology and price competition for its universal
       docking products;

     - its ability to defend our patents and patents pending;

     - its success in establishing and expanding its direct and indirect
       distribution channels with corporate and consumer portable computer
       users;

     - its success in establishing universal docking products as a retail
       product line;

     - its success in attracting and retaining strategic partners, joint
       ventures and licensing opportunities;

     - its success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified
       personnel, particularly in the technical area; and

     - its development and marketing of new products and Split Bridge(R)
       technology applications.

  MOBILITY'S OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS, AND AN
  UNANTICIPATED DECLINE IN REVENUES MAY CAUSE ITS STOCK PRICE TO FALL.

     It is likely that in some future quarter or quarters Mobility's operating
results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If
a shortfall in revenues occurs, the market price for its

common stock may decline significantly. The factors that may cause Mobility's
quarterly operating results to fall short of expectations include:

     - the timing of its competitors, new product or technology introductions
       and product enhancements;

     - market acceptance of its Split Bridge(R) products and technology;

     - market acceptance of its expansion, handheld and power and accessory
       products;

     - the size and timing of customer orders;

     - difficulties with new product production implementation or supply chain;

     - seasonality of sales;

     - product defects and other product quality problems which may result from
       the development of new products;

     - its ability to attract and retain strategic partners to continue the
       advances necessary for Split Bridge(R) technology;

     - the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which Mobility competes
       and the accompanying demand for its products;

     - its ability to expand our internal and external sales forces and build
       the required infrastructure to meet anticipated growth; and

     - its suppliers' ability to perform under their contracts with Mobility.

     Many of these factors are beyond Mobility's control. For these reasons, you
should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of its financial results to
forecast its future performance.

  MOBILITY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE ITS ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WHICH
  COULD IMPAIR ITS EFFICIENCY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATIONS.

     Mobility's success depends on its ability to manage growth effectively. The
scope of its operations and facilities, the number of its employees and the
geographic area of its operations are growing rapidly, primarily as a result of
acquisitions. Mobility may not be able to manage its growth effectively, which
could impair its efficiency, reduce the quality of its solutions, impair further
growth and harm its business, financial condition and operating results. If
Mobility does not effectively manage this growth, it may not be able to operate
efficiently or maintain the quality of its products. Either outcome could harm
its operating results. In the past, Mobility has experienced rapid growth, and
it plans to continue to expand operations. A primary element of its growth
strategy is the acquisition of companies and/or products and technologies that
complement or expand its current capabilities and needs. Acquisitions entail a
number of risks, including costs and time and efforts of management, potential
dilution to existing stockholders, integration issues and diligence issues. This
expansion is expensive and places a significant strain on personnel and other
resources. For example, Mobility's universal connectivity station product line
and new power products are expected to result in a significant increase in the
number of shipments to and from its Scottsdale, Arizona facility. To manage
Mobility's expanded operations effectively, it will need to further improve its
operational, financial and managerial systems and successfully hire, train,
motivate and manage its employees.

  MOBILITY'S FAILURE TO RESPOND TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY IMPAIR ITS
OPERATING RESULTS.

     The market for Mobility's products in general is characterized by rapid
technological advances, changing customer needs and evolving industry standards.
Accordingly, to realize expectations regarding operating results, Mobility
depends on its ability to:

     - develop, in a timely manner, new products and services that keep pace
       with developments in technology;

     - meet evolving customer requirements; and

     - enhance current product and service offerings and deliver those products
       and services through appropriate distribution channels.

     We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and
cost-effective basis, either enhancements to existing products or new products
which respond to technological advances and satisfy increasingly sophisticated
customer needs. If Mobility fails to introduce new products, its operating
results may suffer. In addition, if new industry standards emerge that it does
not anticipate or adapt to, its products could be rendered obsolete and its
business could be materially harmed. Alternatively, any delay in the development
of technology upon which our products are based could result in Mobility's
inability to introduce new products as planned. For example, certain products
that are currently being developed depend upon the availability of USB 2.0. The
success and marketability of technology developed by others is beyond Mobility's
control.

  MOBILITY DEPENDS ON LARGE PURCHASES FROM A FEW SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, AND ANY
  LOSS, CANCELLATION OR DELAY IN PURCHASES BY THESE CUSTOMERS COULD CAUSE A
  SHORTFALL IN REVENUE.

     Mobility derives a substantial portion of its product sales through a
relatively small number of OEMs and third-party distributors. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, OEMs and distributors represented 61% and 25%, respectively,
of Mobility's sales during that period. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
OEMs and distributors represented 72% and 19%, respectively, of Mobility's net
product sales during that period. For the year ended December 31, 2001, OEMs and
distribution represented approximately 72% and 13%, respectively, of Mobility's
net product sales during that period.

     While Mobility's financial performance depends on large orders from a few
significant OEMs and third-party distributors, its contractual relationships are
generally non-exclusive and cancelable upon notice to Mobility. In addition:

     - its distributor agreements generally do not require minimum purchases;

     - its customers can stop purchasing and its distributors can stop
       distributing its products at any time; and

     - its distributor agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one
       year terms, with no obligation of the distributors to renew the
       agreements.

     Net product sales to Targus totaled 27% for the year ended December 31,
1999, 32% for the year ended December 31, 2000, and 28% for the year ended
December 31, 2001. In 2001, Targus distributed a range of Mobility's power
products, on a private label basis, primarily to major retail outlets and
certain OEM fulfillment outlets worldwide. However, in December 2001 Mobility
came to an agreement with Targus to terminate its relationship. It is Mobility's
intention going forward to market its power products under its own brand through
the distribution channels being developed and through the iGo channels. IBM, who
buys brand labeled monitor stands, power products, a portable device bay, and
USB docking stations, accounted for 30% of Mobility's net product sales for the
year ended December 31, 2001.

     Because Mobility's expenses are based on its revenue forecasts, a
substantial reduction or delay in sales of its products to, or unexpected
returns from OEMs and distributors, or the loss of any significant customer
could harm Mobility's business. Although Mobility's largest customers may vary
from period-to-period and is expected to diversify its customers in the future,
Mobility's operating results for any given period may continue to depend to a
significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers.

     There can be no assurance that Mobility's distributors will continue their
current relationships with Mobility or that they will not give higher priority
to the sale of other products, which could include products of Mobility's
competitors. In addition, effective distributors must devote significant
technical, marketing and sales resources to an often lengthy sales cycle. There
can be no assurance that Mobility's current and future distributors will devote
sufficient resources to market its products effectively or that economic or
industry conditions will not adversely affect such distributors. A reduction in
sales efforts or a discontinuance of distribution of Mobility's products by its
distributors could lead to reduced sales. In addition, because Mobility sells a
significant portion of its products through distributors, it is difficult for
Mobility to monitor end user

demand for its products on a current basis. For example, third-party
distributors may place large initial orders which may not be indicative of
long-term end user demand.

     Mobility's operating results could also be adversely affected by changes in
distributors' inventory strategies, which could occur rapidly and, in many
cases, may not be related to end user demand. New products may require different
marketing, sales and distribution strategies than those for its current
products. There can be no assurance that Mobility's distributors will choose or
be able to effectively market these new products or to continue to market its
products.

  MOBILITY'S RELIANCE ON SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES FOR KEY COMPONENTS MAY
  INHIBIT ITS ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

     The principal components of Mobility's products are purchased from outside
vendors. Several of these vendors are the sole source of supply of the
components that they supply. In addition to component suppliers, Mobility's
products are produced under contract manufacturing arrangements with several
manufacturers in Taiwan and Malaysia. Mobility does not have long term supply
agreements with these suppliers. Mobility obtains both components and products
under purchase orders. Any termination of or significant disruption in
Mobility's relationship with its suppliers may prevent Mobility from filling
customer orders in a timely manner as Mobility generally does not maintain large
inventories of components or products. In the event that a termination or
disruption were to occur, Mobility would have to find and qualify an alternative
source. The time it would take to complete this process would vary based upon
the size of the supplier base and the complexity of the component or product.
Delays could range from as little as days to six months in an extreme scenario.
Philips is currently Mobility's sole supplier of Split Bridge(R) technology ASIC
chips. Philips is licensed to use Mobility's technology when manufacturing these
chips exclusively for them. Mobility purchases from Philips on a purchase order
basis. Molex is Mobility's sole supplier of certain system connectors for use
with its universal docking products. Mobility has exclusive use of these
connectors in computer docking applications. Mobility purchases from Molex on a
purchase order basis. Solectron is the sole manufacturer of Mobility's Split
Bridge(R) universal docking stations. In the event that its relationship with
Solectron was unexpectedly terminated or disrupted, Mobility would have to
identify and qualify an alternative supplier. This would impair its ability to
fulfill customer orders. Replacement of Solectron could take several months to
complete.

     Mobility depends upon its suppliers to deliver components that are free
from defects, competitive in functionality and cost and in compliance with its
specifications and delivery schedules. Disruption in supply, a significant
increase in the cost of one or more components, failure of a supplier to remain
competitive in functionality or price, the failure of a supplier to comply with
any of Mobility's procurement needs or the financial failure or bankruptcy of a
supplier could delay or interrupt its ability to manufacture or deliver its
products to customers on a timely basis.

  MOBILITY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING VENDORS TO MANUFACTURE ITS
  PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE A DELAY IN ITS ABILITY TO FILL ORDERS.

     Mobility relies on third-party manufacturers for assembly and subassembly
of its products. Any termination of or significant disruption in Mobility's
relationship with the third-party manufacturers of its products may prevent
Mobility from filling customer orders in a timely manner, as it generally does
not maintain large inventories of its products. Additionally, Mobility's use of
third-party manufacturers reduces control over product quality and manufacturing
yields and costs. Mobility depends upon its third-party manufacturers to deliver
its products that are free from defects, competitive in functionality and cost
and in compliance with its specifications and delivery schedules. Moreover,
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for
warranty obligations on the part of third-party manufacturers, Mobility remains
primarily responsible to its customers for warranty obligations. Disruption in
supply, a significant increase in the cost of the assembly of its products,
failure of a third-party manufacturer to remain competitive in functionality or
price, the failure of a third-party manufacturer to comply with any of its
procurement needs or the financial failure or bankruptcy of a third-party
manufacturer could delay or interrupt Mobility's ability to manufacture or
deliver its products to customers on a timely basis.

  MOBILITY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON SALES TO OEMS, WHOSE UNPREDICTABLE
  DEMANDS AND REQUIREMENTS MAY SUBJECT IT TO POTENTIAL ADVERSE REVENUE
  FLUCTUATIONS.

     Mobility expects that it will continue to be dependent upon a limited
number of OEMs for a significant portion of its net sales in future periods,
although no OEM is presently obligated either to purchase a specified amount of
products or to provide Mobility with binding forecasts of product purchases for
any period. Mobility's products are typically one of many related products used
by portable computer users. Demand for its products is therefore subject to many
risks beyond Mobility's control, including, among others:

     - competition faced by its OEM customers in their particular end markets;

     - market acceptance of Split Bridge(R) technology and products by its OEM
       customers;

     - market acceptance of its expansion, handheld and power accessory products
       by its OEM customers;

     - technical challenges which may or may not be related to the components
       supplied by Mobility;

     - the technical, sales and marketing and management capabilities of its OEM
       customers; and

     - the financial and other resources of its OEM customers.

     Certain divisions within Mobility's OEM customers have developed products
intended to compete with its products. There can be no assurance that Mobility
will not lose sales in the future as a result of such competing products. The
reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from its significant OEM customers,
or the discontinuance of its products by Mobility's end users may subject it to
potential adverse revenue fluctuations.

  MOBILITY HAS IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED RETURNS OF ITS PRODUCTS, AND AS ITS
  BUSINESS GROWS MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED RETURNS, WHICH COULD HARM MOBILITY'S
  REPUTATION AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS OPERATING RESULTS.

     In the past, some of Mobility's customers have returned its products to
Mobility because they felt that the product did not meet their expectations,
specifications and requirements. Historically, these returns have been
approximately 6% of sales. It is likely that Mobility will experience some level
of returns in the future and, as its business grows, the amount of returns may
increase despite its efforts to minimize them. Also, returns may adversely
affect Mobility's relationship with affected customers and may harm its
reputation. This could cause Mobility to lose potential customers and business
in the future. Mobility maintains a financial reserve for future returns that it
believes is adequate given its historical level of returns. If returns increase,
however, its reserve may not be sufficient and operating results could be
negatively affected.

  INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR NOTEBOOK COMPUTER PRODUCTS COULD PREVENT
  MOBILITY FROM INCREASING REVENUE AND SUSTAINING PROFITABILITY.

     The market for Mobility's computer products in general is intensely
competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions
or enhancements and marketing efforts by industry participants. Mobility expects
to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future.
The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for its product
offerings include:

     - corporate and product reputation;

     - innovation with frequent product enhancement;

     - breadth of integrated product line;

     - product design, functionality and features;

     - product quality and performance;

     - ease-of-use;

     - support; and

     - price.

     Although Mobility believes that its products compete favorably with respect
to such factors, there can be no assurance that Mobility can maintain its
competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those
with greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical or other
competitive resources.

     Mobility currently competes with the internal design efforts of both OEMs
and non-OEMs. These OEMs, as well as a number of its non-OEM competitors, have
larger technical staffs, more established and larger marketing and sales
organizations and significantly greater financial resources than Mobility does.
Mobility, however, believes that it has a proprietary position with respect to
its Split Bridge(R) technology and universal connectivity stations as well as a
number of its other products, which may pose a barrier to entry that could keep
Mobility's competitors from developing similar products or selling competing
products in its markets. There can be, however, no assurance that such
competitors will not be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to
the development, sale and promotion of their products than Mobility does or
develop products that are superior to its products or that achieve greater
market acceptance.

     Mobility's future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to
increase sales in its targeted markets. There can be no assurance that Mobility
will be able to compete successfully with its competitors or that the
competitive pressures Mobility faces will not have a material adverse effect.
Mobility's future success will depend in large part upon its ability to increase
its share of its target market and to sell additional products and product
enhancements to existing customers. Future competition may result in price
reductions, reduced margins or decreased sales.

  IF MOBILITY IS UNABLE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AS NECESSARY OR
  IF IT LOSES KEY PERSONNEL, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ITS
  BUSINESS OR ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.

     Mobility believes its future success will depend in large part upon its
ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering,
sales and marketing, finance and operations personnel. Competition for such
personnel in the computer industry is intense, and Mobility competes for such
personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established
companies with significantly greater financial resources. There can be no
assurance Mobility will be successful in identifying, attracting and retaining
such personnel.

     Mobility's success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued
contributions of its key management, engineering, sales and marketing, finance
and manufacturing personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. In
particular, Mobility believes that its future success depends on Charles R.
Mollo, Chief Executive Officer, Donald W. Johnson, Executive Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer, Jeffrey S. Doss, Executive Vice President, and Joan W.
Brubacher, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mobility does not
maintain key person life insurance on any of its executive officers. Except for
Messrs. Mollo, Doss, and Johnson and Ms. Brubacher, Mobility does not have
employment contracts covering any of its senior management. The loss of the
services of any of its key personnel, the inability to identify, attract or
retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel
could make it difficult for Mobility to manage its business and meet key
objectives, such as timely product introductions.

  IF MOBILITY'S PRODUCTS CONTAIN UNDETECTED SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE ERRORS, IT
  COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNEXPECTED EXPENSES AND LOST SALES AND BE SUBJECT TO
  PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.

     A number of Mobility's products are based on new technology and are
complex. As such, they may contain undetected errors or performance problems,
particularly during new or enhanced product launches. Despite product testing
prior to introduction, Mobility's products have in the past, on occasion,
contained errors that were discovered after commercial introduction. Errors or
performance problems may also be discovered in the future. Any future defects
discovered after shipment of its products could result in loss of sales, delays
in market acceptance or product returns and warranty costs. Mobility attempts to
make adequate allowance in its new product release schedule for testing of
product performance. Because of the complexity of its products, however,
Mobility's release of new products may be postponed should test results indicate
the need for redesign and retesting, or should it elect to add product
enhancements in response to customer

feedback. In addition, third-party products, upon which Mobility's products are
dependent, may contain defects which could reduce or undermine the performance
of its products.

     In addition, although Mobility's sales agreements with its customers
typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product
liability claims, there can be no assurance that such limitations of liability
would be enforceable or would otherwise protect Mobility from liability for
damages to a customer resulting from a defect in one of its products. Although
Mobility maintains liability insurance covering certain damages arising from
implementation and use of its products, there can be no assurance that such
insurance would cover or be sufficient to cover any such claims sought against
Mobility.

  IF MOBILITY FAILS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ITS BUSINESS AND
  ABILITY TO COMPETE COULD SUFFER.

     Mobility's success and ability to compete are dependent upon its internally
developed technology and know-how. Mobility relies primarily on a combination of
patent protection, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure
agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights. While
Mobility has certain patents and patents pending, there can be no assurance that
patents pending or future patent applications will be issued or that if issued,
such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that rights
granted thereunder will provide meaningful protection or other commercial
advantage to Mobility. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent
rights will be upheld in the future or that Mobility will be able to preserve
any of its other intellectual property rights. Mobility typically enters into
confidentiality, noncompete or invention assignment agreements with its key
employees, distributors, customers and potential customers, and limits access
to, and distribution of, its product design documentation and other proprietary
information. Additionally, Mobility believes that, due to the rapid pace of
innovation within the computer industry, the following factors represent
important protections for its technology:

     - technological and creative skill of personnel;

     - knowledge and experience of management;

     - name recognition;

     - maintenance and support of products;

     - the ability to develop, enhance, market and acquire products and
       services; and

     - the establishment of strategic relationships in the industry.

     There can be no assurance that Mobility's confidentiality agreements,
confidentiality procedures, noncompetition agreements or other factors will be
adequate to deter misappropriation or independent third-party development of its
technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from obtaining or using
information that it regards as proprietary. Litigation has been, and will in the
future be, necessary to defend Mobility's intellectual property rights, which
could result in substantial cost to, and divisions of efforts by, Mobility.

 MOBILITY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS THAT ARE
 COSTLY TO DEFEND AND COULD LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO USE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE
 FUTURE.

     The laws of some foreign countries do not protect or enforce proprietary
rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition,
under current law, certain patent applications filed with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office before November 29, 2000 may be maintained in
secrecy until a patent is issued. Patent applications filed with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office on or after November 29, 2000, as well as
patent applications filed in foreign countries, may be published some time after
filing but prior to issuance. The right to a patent in the United States is
attributable to the first to invent, not the first to file a patent application.
Mobility cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe
patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent
applications or that its products do not infringe any patents or proprietary
rights of third parties. In the event that any relevant claims of third-party
patents are upheld as valid and enforceable, Mobility could be prevented from
selling its products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of
such patents or be required to redesign its products to avoid infringement.
There

can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or, if available,
would be on terms acceptable to them or that Mobility would be successful in any
attempts to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement. Mobility's
failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign its products would have a
material adverse effect on its business.

     There can be no assurance that Mobility's competitors will not
independently develop technology similar to existing proprietary rights of
others. Mobility expects that its products will increasingly be subject to
infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in its industry
segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments
overlaps. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement claims against Mobility in the future or, if infringement claims
are asserted, that such claims will be resolved in Mobility's favor. Any such
claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly
litigation, cause product shipment delays or require Mobility to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if
required, may not be available on terms favorable to Mobility, if at all. In
addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to protect Mobility's trade
secrets or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the validity and
scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources.

  MOBILITY'S ABILITY TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MANAGE ITS
  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS BEYOND ITS CONTROL.

     Mobility's success will depend, in part, on additional expansion of its
sales in foreign markets. Mobility currently sells products in Europe through
its United Kingdom subsidiary. Mobility intends to expand into other foreign
markets. Mobility's failure to expand international sales in a timely and
cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect. In addition, there
can be no assurance Mobility will be able to maintain or increase international
market demand for its products. Mobility's international business involves a
number of risks, including:

     - the impact of possible recessionary environments in foreign economies;

     - political and economic instability;

     - exchange rate fluctuations;

     - longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts
       receivable collection from distributors and customers;

     - difficulty in managing distributors or sales representatives;

     - increased sales and marketing expense;

     - difficulty in staffing foreign operations;

     - unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

     - reduced or limited protection for intellectual property rights;

     - export restrictions and availability of export licenses;

     - tariffs and other trade barriers;

     - seasonal reduction in business activities;

     - complex foreign laws and treaties including employment laws; and

     - potentially adverse tax consequences.

     Mobility's international sales are priced in both U.S. dollars and in
foreign currency, each of which presents certain risks and uncertainties.
Currency exchange fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on
Mobility's sales denominated in U.S. currency as a decrease in the value of
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could make its pricing more
expensive than, or non-competitive with, products priced in local currencies.
Additionally, due to the number of foreign currencies involved in Mobility's
international sales and

the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, Mobility cannot predict the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to such sales on future
operating results. Mobility has not engaged in hedging transactions with respect
to its net foreign currency exposure. To the extent Mobility implements hedging
activities in the future with respect to foreign currency transactions, there
can be no assurance that it will be successful in such hedging activities.

     Moreover, certain of Mobility's customer purchase agreements are governed
by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from U.S. laws. Therefore,
Mobility may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under such
agreements and to collect amounts owed to Mobility should any customer refuse to
pay such amounts. In addition, Mobility is subject to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act which may place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to
foreign companies that are not subject to that act.

     In January 1999, the new "Euro" currency was introduced in European
countries that are part of the European Monetary Union, or EMU. During 2002, all
EMU countries are expected to completely replace their national currencies with
the Euro. Because a significant amount of uncertainty exists as to the effect
the Euro will have on the marketplace and because all of the final rules and
regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the European Commission
regarding the Euro currency, Mobility cannot determine the effect this will have
on its business.

  MOBILITY'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER ITS
  BUSINESS WHICH COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A MERGER OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL.

     Mobility's principal stockholders, executive officers, directors and
affiliated individuals and entities together beneficially own approximately 18%
of the outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders,
acting together, may be able to influence significantly and possibly control
most matters requiring approval by its stockholders, including approvals of:

     - amendments to its certificate of incorporation;

     - mergers;

     - sale of all or substantially all of its assets;

     - going private transactions; and

     - other fundamental transactions.

     In addition, Mobility's certificate of incorporation does not provide for
cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors. Consequently,
Mobility's present directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and its
respective affiliates may be able to control the election of the members of the
board of directors. Such a concentration of ownership could have an adverse
effect on the price of the common stock, and may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change in control, including transactions in which stockholders
might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market
prices.

     Some provisions of Mobility's charter documents may have anti-takeover
effects that could discourage a change in control and reduce the market price of
its common stock.

     Some provisions of Mobility's certificate of incorporation and bylaws could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mobility even if a change of
control would be beneficial to its stockholders. These provisions include:

     - authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without common stockholder
       approval;

     - prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; and

     - limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.

  MOBILITY'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND YOU MAY LOSE PART OR ALL
  OF THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES.

     Equity markets, particularly the market for technology companies, have
recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are
unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad
market fluctuations may cause the market price of Mobility's common stock to
decline. In addition, the market price of Mobility's common stock is likely to
be highly volatile. In the past, securities class action litigation has often
been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market
price of their securities. This litigation could result in substantial costs and
a diversion of management's attention and resources.

     Significant fluctuations in the market price of Mobility's common stock
could be caused by a number of factors, including:

     - actual or anticipated fluctuations in its operating results;

     - changes in expectations as to its future financial performance;

     - changes in financial estimates of securities analysts;

     - changes in market valuations of other technology companies;

     - announcements by Mobility or its competitors of significant technical
       innovations, design wins, contracts, standards or acquisitions; and

     - the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies.

     Due to these factors, the value of your investment in Mobility common stock
could be reduced. These market fluctuations may cause its stock price to decline
regardless of Mobility's performance.

                         RISK RELATED TO IGO'S BUSINESS

  IGO HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY ON WHICH TO EVALUATE ITS POTENTIAL FOR
FUTURE SUCCESS.

     iGo was incorporated in 1993 and did not begin to generate meaningful
revenues until 1995. Accordingly, iGo has only a limited operating history upon
which it can evaluate its business and prospects. You must consider the risks
and uncertainties frequently encountered by growth stage companies in new and
rapidly evolving markets, such as high-technology and electronic commerce. These
risks include iGo's ability to continue to:

     - sustain sales while reducing operation costs;

     - implement its business model;

     - attract new customers,

     - retain existing customers and maintain customer satisfaction;

     - maintain its gross margins in the event of price competition or rising
       wholesale prices;

     - minimize technical difficulties and system downtime;

     - manage distribution of its proprietary products;

     - manage cost effective marketing programs; and

     - attract, train and retain employees.

     If iGo is unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, its
business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.

  IGO HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND EXPECTS LOSSES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL
  QUARTERS.

     Since its inception in 1993, iGo has incurred significant net losses,
resulting primarily from costs related to developing its proprietary databases,
establishing its brand, building its customer contact center, developing

relationships with suppliers and attracting users to its website. At December
31, 2001, iGo had an accumulated deficit of approximately $74.8 million. If its
revenue is less than anticipated or its operating expenses exceed expectations,
iGo's losses will be significantly greater, which will in turn delay or prevent
its achievement of profitability.

  IGO MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO REACH PROFITABILITY.

     iGo's internal financial models project that its current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, together with other available capital
resources, may be sufficient to permit iGo to reach a cash-flow positive state.
However, there can be no assurance that iGo will reach cash-flow positive
without raising additional funds. iGo may experience unexpected expenditures or
higher than expected expenditures, which may require it to seek additional
funding. If additional funding is necessary, iGo may seek such additional
funding through debt or equity financings. iGo currently has no commitments for
any additional financing, and there can be no assurance that adequate funds for
its operations will be available. iGo's auditors have given it a "going concern"
opinion, which may further limit its ability to obtain additional financing. A
lack of sufficient capital may require iGo to delay, scale back or even
eliminate some or all of its operations.

  IF IGO'S SHARES ARE DELISTED, ITS STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE FURTHER AND IT MAY
  BE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

     In February 2002, iGo received notice from Nasdaq that it is not in
compliance with Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5), which requires iGo's common stock
to have a minimum $1.00 bid price per share. Under the Marketplace Rules, iGo
has until May 15, 2002, to regain compliance by achieving a closing bid price
for its shares of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days.
iGo has also been notified that it is not in compliance with Marketplace Rule
4450(a)(2), which requires that the minimum market value of its publicly held
shares (shares held by non-affiliates of iGo) be at least $5,000,000, and that
iGo has until June 17, 2002 to regain compliance by raising the market value of
publicly held shares to $5,000,000 or more for ten consecutive trading days.
Failure to regain compliance with either of these standards would result in its
common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. iGo could appeal a
delisting decision and/or transfer its securities to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.
There can be no assurance that any such appeal would be successful or that iGo
could maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market for any substantial period of time. While iGo stock would
continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting
from either Nasdaq Market, iGo expects that its stock price and trading volume
would decline, possibly significantly, and its ability to raise additional
capital would be substantially diminished by any such delisting.

  ALTHOUGH IGO IS AWARE OF NO DETERMINATIONS, CONCERNS REGARDING THE SEC
  INVESTIGATION COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a formal order of private
investigation concerning the events underlying iGo's revisions of its fiscal
2000 operating results based on adjustments to fourth quarter 2000 revenue,
which results were announced and revised in certain press releases issued in
January and March of 2001. In connection with its investigation, the Commission
will also be reviewing the restatement of iGo's financial statements set forth
in its 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any amendment thereto, and certain
related accounting, sales and organizational matters. Although the Staff of the
Commission has made no determinations that iGo is aware of with respect to this
investigation, the investigation itself could raise concerns about iGo in the
eyes of customers and investors and, as a result, could harm iGo's business and
its stock price.

  IGO'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS
  QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.

     Although independent market research firms forecast that shipments of
portable personal computers, the number of wireless subscribers and the market
for accessories for mobile electronic devices will grow substantially over the
next few years, iGo cannot be certain that this growth will actually occur or
that its sales will grow at the same rate or at all. iGo cannot forecast with
any degree of certainty the extent of its sales of

these products. iGo expects its operating results could fluctuate significantly
from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors including:

     - its ability to attract prospects and convert them into customers;

     - the level of merchandise returns it experiences;

     - changes and seasonal fluctuations in the buying patterns of its
       customers;

     - its inability to obtain adequate supplies of high-demand products;

     - unanticipated cost increases or delays in shipping of its products,
       transaction processing, or production and distribution of its direct
       marketing materials;

     - unanticipated delays with respect to product introductions; and

     - the costs, timing and impact of its marketing and promotional
       initiatives.

     Because of these and other factors, iGo believes that quarter to quarter
comparisons of its results of operations are not good indicators of its future
performance. If iGo's operating results fall below the expectations of investors
in some future periods, its stock price will likely decline further. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Quarterly Results of Operations" for more information on iGo's
quarterly operating results.

  STRENGTHENING THE IGO, ROAD WARRIOR AND XTEND BRANDS IS CRITICAL TO IGO'S
  SUCCESS.

     iGo believes that strengthening the iGo brand as well as the brands of its
proprietary product lines, Road Warrior and Xtend, will be critical to the
success of its business. iGo cannot be certain that its brands will attract new
customers or retain existing customers, and the failure to maintain a strong and
effective brand may harm its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

  IGO DEPENDS ON KEY PERSONNEL TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS, AND IGO MAY NOT BE ABLE
  TO HIRE ENOUGH ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL AS ITS BUSINESS
  GROWS.

     iGo's performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and
on the performance of its executive officers. The loss of the services of any of
iGo's executive officers could harm its business. Any of iGo's officers or
employees can terminate his or her employment relationship at any time. Some key
members of its management team have recently been hired. These individuals have
had little experience working in iGo's organization. iGo cannot be certain that
it will be able to integrate new executives or other employees into its
organization effectively. In addition, there are significant administrative
burdens placed on iGo's management team as a result of its status as a public
company. The loss of any of iGo's officers could harm its results of operations
and financial condition. In addition, iGo may be unable to retain its other key
employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in
the future, which could harm its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

  COMPETITION MAY DECREASE IGO'S MARKET SHARE, NET REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS
  AND MAY CAUSE ITS STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.

     The mobile computing and communications markets in which iGo operates is
rapidly evolving and highly competitive. iGo's competitors operate in a number
of different distribution channels, including electronic commerce, traditional
retailing, catalog retailing and direct selling. iGo currently or potentially
competes with a variety of companies in the sale of products in specific
categories, including:

     - mobile products suppliers such as Targus;

     - retailers and etailers such as CompUSA and Amazon.com;

     - direct marketers such as Buy.com, CDW, Insight and Microwarehouse; and

     - traditional mobile device manufacturers or OEMs such as Fujitsu, Toshiba,
       IBM, NEC, Acer, Gateway, Dell, Nokia, Motorola and Erickson.

     iGo's competitors may have the ability to devote substantially more
resources to the development, marketing, and/or sale of mobile device
accessories than iGo does. In addition, larger and more well-financed entities
may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with iGo's competitors. Some of
its competitors may be able to secure products from suppliers on more favorable
terms, fulfill customer orders more efficiently and adopt more aggressive
pricing or inventory availability policies than iGo can. Finally, new
technologies and the expansion of existing technologies, such as price
comparison programs that search for products from a variety of websites, may
direct customers to other online merchants. There can be no assurance that iGo
will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

  THE LOSS OF IGO'S PROPRIETARY DATABASES WOULD SERIOUSLY HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     iGo's proprietary databases are a key competitive advantage. If iGo fails
to keep these databases current or if the proprietary customer, product,
supplier and compatibility information contained in these databases is damaged
or destroyed, iGo's business would be seriously harmed and stock price would
decline.

  THE FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY GROW, MANAGE AND USE IGO'S DATABASE OF CUSTOMERS
  AND USERS WOULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     iGo intends to continually expand its database of customers, potential
customers and website registrants to more effectively create targeted direct
marketing offers. iGo seeks to expand its customer database by using information
it collects through its website, search engine optimization, channel
relationships, customer contact center and purchased or rented lists. iGo must
also continually develop and refine its techniques for segmenting this
information to maximize its usefulness. If iGo is unable to expand its customer
database or if it fails to utilize this information successfully, then its
business model may not be successful. In addition, if federal or state
governments enact privacy legislation resulting in the increased regulation of
mailing lists, iGo could experience increased costs in complying with
potentially burdensome regulations concerning the solicitation of consents to
keep or add customer names to its mailing lists.

  FAILURE OF IGO'S STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD HARM ITS
  BUSINESS.

     iGo intends to continue to establish, leverage and grow key strategic
relationships with manufacturers, airlines, suppliers and electronic commerce
partners to enable it to collect crucial product-specific information, ensure
access to adequate product supply and acquire new customers. iGo cannot be
certain that any of these strategic relationships or partnerships will be or
continue to be successful in attracting new customers. iGo's strategic
relationships are often not subject to formal agreements and/or can be
terminated on little or no advance notice. The terms of its agreements with
Acer, NEC and IBM require iGo to purchase minimum amounts of product each year.
If iGo fails to meet these purchase levels, those parties have the discretion to
terminate iGo's agreements with them. iGo has not met such purchase levels to
date, but has received no indication from any of those parties that they intend
to terminate the relationship. Also, in each case either party may terminate the
agreement with or without cause on two to three months' written notice.
Accordingly, iGo can provide no assurance that these relationships will continue
on their current terms or at all. If these programs fail to attract additional
customers or iGo is unable to maintain these relationships, its business,
financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.

  IGO MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS INVENTORY AND IMPROVE ITS GROSS MARGINS.

     In order to fulfill its orders, iGo depends upon its factories and vendors
to produce sufficient quantities of products according to schedule. iGo may
maintain high inventory levels in some categories of merchandise in an effort to
ensure that these products are available to its customers. This may expose iGo
to risks of excess inventory and outdated merchandise, which could harm its
business. In 2001, iGo changed its product strategy to focus on offering a
targeted core product line with a higher gross margin. As a result of this
change of

strategy, iGo recorded significant write-offs of inventory in 2001. If iGo
underestimates customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may purchase
from its competitors. iGo also seeks to negotiate with its vendors to get the
best quality available at the best prices in order to maintain and increase its
gross margins. iGo's failure to be able to effectively manage its factories and
vendors effectively would harm its operating results.

  FAILURE OF THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO SHIP PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO IGO'S CUSTOMERS
  COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     For the year ended December 31, 2001, approximately 22% of iGo's total net
revenues were from products shipped to its customers directly from its
suppliers. The failure of these suppliers to continue to ship products directly
to iGo customers or to ship products to its customers in a timely manner could
result in lost revenues, customer dissatisfaction and damage to iGo's
reputation. In addition, if iGo could not depend on these suppliers to ship
products to its customers directly, it would have to carry the products in its
inventory, which would expose iGo to risks of excess inventory, outdated
merchandise and increased warehouse costs, all of which could harm its business.

  FAILURE OF THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS TO DELIVER IGO'S PRODUCTS TIMELY AND
  CONSISTENTLY COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     iGo's supply and distribution system is primarily dependent upon its
relationships with United Parcel Service and Federal Express. iGo ships
substantially all of its orders with these carriers. Because iGo does not have
written agreements with these carriers that guarantee continued service, iGo
cannot be sure that its relationships with these carriers will continue on terms
favorable to iGo, or at all. If iGo's relationship with one or more of these
carriers is terminated or impaired, or if one or more of these carriers is
unable to ship products for iGo, whether through labor shortage, slow down or
stoppage, deteriorating financial or business conditions or for any other
reason, iGo would be required to rely on other carriers. These carriers may not
be able to accommodate the increased shipping volume, in which case iGo would be
required to use alternative carriers, with whom iGo may have no prior business
relationship, for the shipment of products to its customers. iGo may be unable
to engage an alternative carrier on a timely basis or upon terms favorable to
iGo. Changing carriers would likely harm its business, financial condition and
results of operations. Potential adverse consequences include:

     - reduced package tracking information;

     - delays in order processing and product delivery;

     - increased delivery costs, resulting in reduced gross margins; and

     - reduced shipment quality, which may result in damaged products and
       customer dissatisfaction.

  IGO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE ITS TRADEMARKS, INTERNET ADDRESSES
  AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

     iGo regards its brand and substantial elements of its website and
relational databases as proprietary, and seek their protection through
trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret laws. iGo enters into non-
disclosure agreements with its employees and consultants, and generally with
strategic partners. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third
parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use iGo's intellectual property without
its authorization.

     iGo's brand and Internet address, www.iGo.com, are important components of
its business strategy. iGo has obtained federal trademark registrations for its
iGo, iGo (stylized), Road Warrior, Xtend, 1-800-Batteries, iGo.com and
PowerXtender trademarks. Mobile Technology Outfitter and Pocket Dock are
trademarks of iGo or its subsidiaries.

     iGo also relies to a material extent on technology developed and licensed
from third parties. These licenses may not continue to be available to iGo on
commercially reasonable terms in the future. The loss of existing technology
licenses could harm the performance of its existing services until equivalent
technology can be identified, obtained and integrated. Failure to obtain new
technology licenses may result in delays or reductions in the introduction of
new features, functions or services, which would harm iGo's business. iGo has

been notified from time to time that certain products that it offers may
infringe on the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurances that
third parties will not claim infringement in the future. iGo expects that the
continued growth of the Internet will result in an increasing number of
infringement claims as legal standards related to its market continue to evolve.
Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation, and may have a material adverse effect on its business and results
of operations.

     iGo has also registered its iGo, Xtend and Road Warrior trademarks in
certain foreign countries in which it currently conducts, or intends to conduct
significant business. It is often difficult to obtain clear, registered title to
trademarks in foreign countries. iGo has encountered certain conflicts in
connection with these foreign trademark applications, and there is no guarantee
that it will be able to secure registrations in any particular foreign country.
In addition, iGo may be prohibited from using one or more of its marks in
certain foreign countries, which may have a material adverse effect on its
business and results of operations.

     iGo currently holds various Internet domain names, including iGo.com,
RoadWarrior.com and XtendMicro.com. The acquisition and maintenance of domain
names generally is regulated by Internet regulatory bodies. The regulation of
domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change.
Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional
domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a
result, iGo may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all
countries in which it conducts business. Furthermore, the relationship between
regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar
proprietary rights continues to evolve. Therefore, iGo may be unable to prevent
third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or
otherwise decrease the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights.

  IGO MAY BE VULNERABLE TO NEW TAX OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD BE IMPOSED ON
  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS.

     iGo does not expect to collect sales or other similar taxes or goods
shipped into most states. However, one or more states or the federal government
may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies,
such as iGo, which engages in or facilitates electronic commerce. A number of
proposals have been made at the state and local levels that would impose
additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the Internet. These
proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of electronic
commerce and cause purchasing through iGo's website to be less attractive to
customers. In October 1998, the United States Congress passed legislation
limiting for three years the ability of the states to impose taxes on
Internet-based transactions, which moratorium has been extended until November
2003. Failure to renew this legislation could result in the imposition by
various states of taxes on electronic commerce. Further, states have attempted
to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketing sales from
businesses such as iGo. A successful assertion by one or more states that iGo
should have collected or be collecting sales taxes on the sale of products could
harm its business.

  IF IGO EXPANDS ITS BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, IGO'S BUSINESS WOULD BECOME
  INCREASINGLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND CHALLENGES THAT
  COULD AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     Although iGo has not had meaningful international revenues to date, it
intends to increase its international sales efforts. International sales are
subject to inherent risks and challenges that could affect iGo's results of
operations, including:

     - the need to develop new supplier relationships;

     - unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;

     - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

     - potential adverse tax consequences;

     - price controls or other restrictions on, or fluctuations in, foreign
       currency; and

     - difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses.

     To the extent iGo generates international sales in the future, any negative
effects on its international business could harm iGo's business, financial
condition and results of operations as a whole. In particular, gains and losses
on the conversion of foreign payments into U.S. dollars may contribute to
fluctuations in iGo's results of operations, and fluctuating exchange rates
could cause reduced revenues from dollar-denominated international sales.

  ANY ACQUISITIONS IGO MAKES COULD DISRUPT ITS BUSINESS AND HARM ITS FINANCIAL
  CONDITION.

     In addition to iGo's acquisitions of Road Warrior, Cellular Accessory
Warehouse and Xtend Micro Products, iGo may again invest in or buy complementary
businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of any
investments or purchases, iGo could:

     - issue stock that would dilute the percentage ownership of its current
       stockholders;

     - incur debt;

     - assume liabilities;

     - incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible
       assets; or

     - incur large and immediate write-offs.

     These acquisitions could also involve numerous operational risks,
including:

     - problems combining the purchased operations, products or technologies;

     - unanticipated costs;

     - diversion of management's attention away from iGo's core business;

     - adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
       customers;

     - risks associated with entering markets in which iGo has no or limited
       prior experience; and

     - potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the purchased
       organizations.

     iGo cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully integrate any
businesses, products or technologies that it has acquired or might acquire in
the future.

  THE LOSS OF TECHNOLOGIES LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES COULD HARM IGO'S
  BUSINESS.

     iGo relies to a material extent on technology developed and licensed from
third parties. The loss of existing technology licenses could harm the
performance of its existing services until equivalent technology can be
identified, obtained and integrated. Failure to obtain new technology licenses
may result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new features,
functions or services, which would harm iGo's business.

  IGO'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE HARMED
  IF IT WERE TO BE LIABLE FOR DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCTS IT OFFERS.

     iGo may be subject to product liability claims for the products it designs
and develops as well as those it sells. While iGo believes that its product
liability coverage of $7,000,000 is currently adequate, iGo can provide no
assurance that the insurance can be maintained in the future at a reasonable
cost or in amounts sufficient to protect iGo against losses due to liability. A
successful liability claim brought against iGo in excess of relevant insurance
coverage could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.

  DAMAGE TO OR DESTRUCTION OF IGO'S WAREHOUSE COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF ITS
  INVENTORY, WHICH COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
  OPERATIONS.

     If all or most of the inventory in iGo's warehouse were damaged or
destroyed, iGo might be unable to replace the inventory in a timely manner and,
as a result, be unable to process orders in a timely manner or at all.
Approximately 78% of the products iGo sells come from the inventory in its
warehouse. iGo cannot be

certain that it would be able to replace the inventory as quickly as its
customer orders demand, which may result in the loss of revenue and customers,
which would harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.

RISKS RELATED TO THE INTERNET INDUSTRY

  IGO IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE.

     iGo's industry is new and rapidly evolving. iGo's business would be harmed
if Internet usage does not continue to grow. Internet usage may be inhibited for
a number of reasons, including:

     - inadequate Internet infrastructure;

     - inconsistent quality of service; and

     - unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed service.

     If Internet usage grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it by this growth, or its performance and
reliability may decline. In addition, websites, including iGo's, have
experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other
delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. iGo anticipates
that these outages or delays will occur from time to time in the future and, if
they occur frequently or for extended periods of time, Internet usage, including
usage of iGo's website, could grow more slowly or decline.

  A PORTION OF IGO'S LONG-TERM SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MARKET, WHICH IS UNCERTAIN.

     A portion of iGo's future revenues substantially depends upon the
widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as an effective medium of commerce
by consumers. Demand for recently introduced products and services over the
Internet is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Although independent market
research firms forecast that the number of Internet users worldwide will grow
substantially in the next few years, iGo cannot be certain that this growth will
occur or that its sales will grow at the same rate. The development of the
Internet as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of risks
including:

     - potential customers may be unwilling to shift their purchasing from
       traditional vendors to online vendors;

     - insufficient availability of or changes in telecommunications services
       could result in slower response times, which could delay the acceptance
       of the Internet as an effective commerce medium;

     - continued growth in the number of Internet users;

     - concerns about transaction security;

     - continued development of the necessary technological infrastructure;

     - development of enabling technologies; and

     - uncertain and increasing government regulations.

  RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD RENDER IGO'S WEBSITES AND SYSTEMS OBSOLETE
  AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

     The Internet and the electronic commerce industry are characterized by
rapid technological change, sudden changes in customer requirements and
preferences, frequent new product and service introductions incorporating new
technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that
could render iGo's existing websites and transaction processing systems
obsolete. The emerging nature of these products and services and their rapid
evolution will require that iGo continually improve the performance, features
and

reliability of its online services, particularly in response to competitive
offerings. iGo's success will depend, in part, on its ability:

     - to enhance its existing products and services; and

     - to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and
       practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.

     The development of websites and other proprietary technology entails
significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures
and lead time. iGo may be unable to use new technologies effectively or adapt
its website, proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to
customer requirements or emerging industry standards, which could harm its
business. Updating iGo's technology internally and licensing new technology from
third parties may require significant additional capital expenditures and could
affect its results of operations.

  IGO IS EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SECURITY AND
  CREDIT CARD FRAUD, WHICH MAY REDUCE COLLECTIONS AND DISCOURAGE ONLINE
  TRANSACTIONS.

     Consumer concerns about privacy or the security of transactions conducted
on the Internet may inhibit the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce.
To securely transmit confidential information, such as customer credit card
numbers, iGo relies on encryption and authentication technology that it licenses
from third parties. iGo cannot predict whether the algorithms it uses to protect
customer transaction data will be compromised. Furthermore, iGo's servers may be
vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar
disruptions. iGo may need to expend significant additional capital and other
resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused
by any security breaches. The measures iGo takes to protect against security
breaches may not be successful. iGo's failure to prevent security breaches could
harm its business.

     To date, iGo has suffered minor losses as a result of orders placed with
fraudulent credit card data even though the associated financial institution
approved payment of the orders in each case. Under current credit card
practices, a merchant is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions where,
as is the case with the transactions iGo processes, that merchant does not
obtain a cardholder's signature. Failure to adequately control fraudulent credit
card transactions could reduce iGo's revenues and harm its business.

  IGO COULD FACE LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON AND COMMUNICATIONS
  THROUGH ITS WEBSITE.

     iGo may be subject to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or
trademark infringement or other claims relating to the information it publishes
on its website. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully,
against Internet companies as well as print publications in the past. iGo also
utilizes email as a marketing medium, which may subject it to potential risks,
such as:

     - liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email;

     - lost or misdirected messages; or

     - illegal or fraudulent use of email.

     These claims could result in substantial costs and a diversion of iGo's
management's attention and resources, which could harm its business.

  EFFORTS TO REGULATE OR ELIMINATE THE USE OF MECHANISMS THAT AUTOMATICALLY
  COLLECT INFORMATION ON VISITORS TO IGO'S WEBSITE MAY INTERFERE WITH IGO'S
  ABILITY TO TARGET ITS MARKETING EFFORTS.

     Websites typically place a small tracking program on a user's hard drive
without the user's knowledge or consent. These programs automatically collect
data about any visits that a user makes to various websites. Website operators
use these mechanisms for a variety of purposes, including the collection of data
derived from users' Internet activity. Most currently available Internet
browsers allow users to elect to remove these tracking programs at any time or
to prevent this information from being stored on their hard drive. In addition,

some commentators, privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested
limiting or eliminating the use of these tracking mechanisms. Any reduction or
limitation in the use of this software could limit the effectiveness of iGo's
sales and marketing efforts.

  IGO COULD FACE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF AND
  LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE INTERNET.

     New Internet legislation or regulation or the application of existing laws
and regulations to the Internet and electronic commerce could harm iGo's
business, financial condition and results of operations. iGo is subject to
regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly
applicable to communications over the Internet and access to electronic
commerce. Although there are currently few laws and regulations directly
applicable to electronic commerce, it is possible that a number of laws and
regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet covering issues such as
user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, antitrust, taxation
and characteristics and quality of products and services. For example, the
United States Congress recently enacted Internet laws regarding children's
privacy, copyrights and transmission of sexually explicit material. In addition,
the European Union recently enacted its own Internet privacy regulations.
Furthermore, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce
may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose
additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. The adoption
of any additional laws or regulations regarding the Internet may decrease the
growth of the Internet or electronic commerce, which could, in turn, decrease
the demand for iGo's products and services and increase iGo's cost of doing
business. In addition, if iGo were alleged to have violated federal, state or
foreign civil or criminal law, it could be subject to liability, and even if iGo
could successfully defend such claims, they may involve significant legal
compliance and litigation costs.

                    MARKETS, MARKET PRICES AND DIVIDEND DATA

     Mobility common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq National Market
("Nasdaq") under the symbol "MOBE" since June 30, 2000, the date of its initial

                       SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA
                                 PER SHARE DATA

     The table below shows the loss and book value per share for Mobility and
iGo both on a historical and a pro forma basis. No dividends have been paid to
the stockholders of either Mobility or iGo. The Mobility pro forma data was
derived by combining historical consolidated financial information of Mobility
and iGo using the purchase method of accounting for the merger. iGo equivalent
pro forma data was derived by multiplying the Mobility pro forma loss per share
before nonrecurring charges or credits directly attributable to the mergers and
the pro forma book value per share by an assumed exchange ratio of 0.10242
shares of Mobility common stock for each share of iGo common stock, so that the
per share amounts are equated to the respective values for one share of iGo
common stock.

     You should read the respective audited financial statements and related
footnotes of Mobility and iGo included in this proxy statement/prospectus. The
pro forma per share data are not necessarily indicative of the results that

                            THE IGO SPECIAL MEETING

GENERAL

     The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors of iGo
Corporation for use at the special meeting of stockholders to be held on
                    , 2002 at           .m., local time, or at any postponement
or adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the
accompanying Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders.

TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting will be held at the Residence Inn by Marriott located
at 9845 Gateway Drive, Reno, Nevada 89511. The telephone number at the Residence
Inn by Marriott is (775) 853-8800. iGo's principal executive offices are located
at 9393 Gateway Drive, Reno, Nevada 89511, where its telephone number is (775)
746-6140.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, iGo stockholders will vote upon a proposal to
approve the merger and the merger agreement, dated as of March 23, 2002, among
Mobility, the merger subsidiary and iGo. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A. You may also vote on
any other matters that may properly come before the special meeting and any
adjournments or postponement thereof.

RECORD DATE; STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE

     Stockholders of record of iGo common stock at the close of business on May
22, 2002, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. At the
May 22, 2002 record date,      shares of iGo common stock were issued and
outstanding.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time before its use by delivering to iGo (Attention: Scott
Shackelton, Inspector of Elections) a written notice of revocation or a duly
executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the special meeting and
voting in person.

VOTING; QUORUM; VOTES REQUIRED

     Holders of shares of iGo common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the special meeting will be
tabulated by the inspector of elections with the assistance of iGo's transfer
agent. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of iGo's common stock
entitled to vote must be present at the special meeting, in person or by proxy,
to constitute a quorum to transact business. The inspector will determine
whether or not a quorum is present.

     The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or
represented by proxy at a duly held special meeting at which a quorum is present
is required under Delaware law for approval of proposals presented to
stockholders. The inspector will treat abstentions as shares that are present
and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and
will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve the merger
and merger agreement. Any proxy which is returned using the form of proxy
enclosed and which is not marked as to a particular item will be voted for the
merger and, as the proxy holders deem advisable, on other matters that may come
before the special meeting, as the case may be with respect to the item not
marked. If a broker does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares
to vote on a particular matter, those shares will not be considered as present
and entitled to vote with respect to that matter.

     The members of iGo's board of directors and certain significant
stockholders and executive officers, holding in the aggregate approximately
33.9% of iGo's issued and outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.

     As of the record date, Mobility's directors and executive officers
beneficially owned no iGo common stock. As of the record date, Mobility and its
subsidiaries beneficially owned 1,000 shares of iGo common stock, which it will
vote in favor of the merger and merger agreement.

     iGo believes that the tabulation procedures to be followed by the inspector
are consistent with the general statutory requirements in Delaware concerning
voting of shares and determination of a quorum.

POSTPONEMENT OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     If an insufficient number of votes for the merger is received before the
scheduled special meeting date and a quorum is not obtained, iGo may decide to
postpone or adjourn the special meeting. If this happens, proxies that have been
received that either have been voted for the merger or contain no instructions
will be voted for adjournment. At any subsequent reconvening of the special
meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have
been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any
proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent
special meeting.

OTHER MATTERS CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     iGo's board of directors is not aware of any business to be brought before
the special meeting other than the proposal to approve the merger agreement and
the related merger, including the matters described under the proposal. If other
matters are properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournments or
postponements of the special meeting, the persons appointed as proxies will have
authority to vote the shares represented by properly executed proxies in
accordance with their discretion and judgment as to the best interests of iGo.

PROXY SOLICITATION

     The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by iGo. In addition, iGo may
reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of
shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial
owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of our directors, officers and
regular employees, without additional compensation, personally, by mail,
telephone, telegram, email or fax.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF IGO

     The iGo board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable, in
the best interests of and fair to the stockholders of iGo. Accordingly, the iGo
board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger
and recommends that the stockholders vote FOR adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the proxy statement/prospectus contains descriptions of the
material aspects of the merger and related transactions, including the merger
agreement and certain other agreements entered into in connection therewith.
While we believe that the following description covers the material terms of the
merger, the merger agreement and the related transactions and agreements, the
description may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You
should read the entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger
agreement attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus and
incorporated herein by reference.

GENERAL

     Mobility and iGo have entered into a merger agreement, dated as of March
23, 2002. Mobility formed IGOC Acquisition, Inc., or the merger subsidiary, to
facilitate the merger. When the merger closes, iGo will merge with and into the
merger subsidiary. The separate corporate existence of iGo will cease, and the
merger subsidiary will be the surviving entity.

     The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the merger subsidiary will
continue as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving entity
following the merger. The directors and officers of the merger subsidiary at the
time of the merger will become the initial directors and officers of the
surviving entity upon completion of the merger. Mobility will exchange shares of
its common stock and cash for shares of iGo's common stock.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Because of the complementary nature of the respective businesses and
technologies of Mobility and iGo, the two companies have periodically engaged in
discussions concerning potential business relationships between the companies
for several years. The initial discussions were driven principally by the
perception that significant strategic benefits could be realized by iGo's
distribution of certain Mobility products in iGo's marketing and distribution
channels.

     In November 2001, Mobility's management team and certain of its board
members began discussing the financial and strategic aspects of a potential
business combination involving iGo. Additionally, Mobility's management team
compiled and analyzed available public information regarding iGo. As a result of
these discussions and analysis, in December 2001, Charles Mollo, Mobility's
Chief Executive Officer, contacted Rick Shaff, iGo's President and Chief
Executive Officer at the time, and expressed an interest in exploring the
possibility of a potential business combination or alternative arrangement
between the companies.

     On January 17, 2002, the board of directors of Mobility, together with its
legal counsel, held a telephonic meeting to review the information and analysis
prepared by Mobility's management team of a possible merger with iGo and
previously delivered to Mobility's board of directors. At this meeting,
Mobility's management team and legal counsel presented to Mobility's board of
directors the above information and analysis. After discussions, Mobility's
board of directors unanimously authorized management to continue discussions
with iGo with the goal of completing a merger with iGo. On January 21, 2002, Mr.
Mollo and Mr. Shaff had a conversation discussing in general terms the merits of
a potential business combination of the two companies. On January 25, 2002,
Mobility and iGo entered into a confidentiality agreement which mutually
protected the confidential information being disclosed by each of Mobility and
iGo to the other. Following the execution of the confidentiality agreement, each
company responded to detailed due diligence requests of the other company and
conducted intensive due diligence of the other company. This due diligence
included a review of all products, historical results, margins, balance sheets,
marketing strategies, operations, contracts, records, historical and projected
catalog, e-commerce, and channel sales, and the potential to introduce
Mobility's products in iGo distribution channels. Mobility also prepared
specific organization plans, strategies, and budgets for a potential combined
entity. On January 28, 2002, iGo's board of directors held a meeting at which
time Mr. Shaff discussed his preliminary conversations with Mr. Mollo. At this
meeting the iGo board of directors authorized Mr. Shaff and David Olson, iGo's
newly appointed acting President and Chief Executive Officer, to continue
discussions with Mr. Mollo concerning a potential business combination.
Following this

meeting, Mr. Mollo and Joan Brubacher, Mobility's Chief Financial Officer, held
several conference calls and had several meetings with Mr. Olson, after which
the management teams of both companies concluded that a business combination
could be highly beneficial for the stockholders of each company.

     The premise of the early discussions was that Mobility's innovative
products and technology could be effectively leveraged with iGo's strong U.S.
brand identity, direct catalogue, e-commerce channel and distribution and
reseller channels. As a result of these preliminary discussions, and Mobility's
initial operational due diligence investigation and analysis, Mobility's
management team concluded that a combination of the companies would serve as a
basis to eliminating a major iGo weakness, which Mobility's management team
concluded was a lack of highly differentiated products, as well as a major
Mobility weakness, which Mobility's management team determined was a lack of
non-OEM distribution channels. Both management teams further hypothesized that
significant consolidated cost savings could be achieved by eliminating
duplicative general and administrative, engineering, management and sales and
marketing expenses. An additional area of opportunity explored by the two
management teams was the potential to distribute certain iGo products in
Mobility's European distribution channels.

     Starting on February 12, 2002, a diligence team consisting of operational
personnel of Mobility, as well as a representative of Mobility's legal counsel,
conducted a preliminary due diligence investigation of iGo at iGo's headquarters
in Reno, Nevada. On February 14, 2002, the board of directors of Mobility and
its legal counsel met telephonically to receive an update on the potential
merger with iGo and to discuss various alternatives and structures.

     From February 14, 2002 until approximately March 11, 2002, Mr. Mollo, Mr.
Olson and Peter Gotcher, a director and significant stockholder of iGo,
exchanged numerous proposed alternative structures and term sheets. These
alternatives and structures included an all cash offer, an all stock offer and
combinations of the two. During this period, the iGo board of directors met
telephonically three times to consider the various alternatives and term sheets.
Mr. Mollo also contacted various members of Mobility's board of directors during
such period for advice, and had a meeting with Mobility's board of directors on
February 27, 2002 to discuss the status of the potential merger and the
significant transaction points being negotiated. On March 8, 2002, Mobility's
legal counsel presented to iGo and iGo's legal counsel the initial draft of an
agreement and plan of merger and a lock-up and voting agreement. From that date
until March 23, 2002, Mr. Mollo, Ms. Brubacher and Mobility's legal counsel
negotiated the terms of those agreements with Messrs. Olson, Gotcher and Scott
Shackelton, iGo's Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Finance, and
Secretary, and iGo's legal counsel.

     On March 12, 2002, a diligence team consisting of operational personnel of
iGo conducted a due diligence investigation of Mobility at Mobility's
headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. Starting on March 14, 2002, a diligence
team consisting of operational personnel of Mobility, as well as representatives
of Mobility's legal counsel, conducted a due diligence investigation of iGo at
iGo's headquarters in Reno, Nevada.

     On March 19, 2002, the board of directors of Mobility convened a special
meeting. At this meeting, Mobility's management and legal counsel presented to
Mobility's board of directors the current drafts of the agreement and plan of
merger and the lock-up and voting agreement, and discussed significant findings
from their due diligence investigation. After such presentations and
discussions, Mobility's board of directors unanimously approved the agreement
and plan of merger and the lock-up and voting agreement, in the forms presented
to the board at that meeting (subject to any changes agreed to by Mr. Mollo that
were not substantively materially adverse to Mobility). On March 20 and again on
March 22, 2002, the iGo board of directors met by teleconference to discuss the
status of the documentation of the merger and final negotiations on merger
terms. On March 24, 2002, the iGo board of directors held a meeting by
teleconference at which time they reviewed, considered and unanimously approved
the agreement and plan of merger and lock-up and voting agreement. Mobility, iGo
and certain other persons and entities then entered into the agreement and plan
of merger and the lock-up and voting agreement, which event was announced
publicly by Mobility and iGo on March 25, 2002.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Mobility's board of directors believes that the two companies complement
each other by providing a well-established distribution channel for Mobility's
products and the opportunity to sell iGo's products in Europe. Consequently,
Mobility perceives opportunities for increased operating efficiencies through
this combination and believes that, by combining forces, Mobility and iGo will
be able to more effectively compete and more successfully take advantage of
opportunities in the mobile technology industry than either company could
individually.

     Consequently, the merger is intended to serve the following purposes:

     - broaden the combined entities' geographic bases;

     - increase market share for iGo's products in Europe;

     - provide an alternative distribution channel and access to additional
       customers for Mobility products; and

     - enhance stockholder value by achieving certain cost savings from
       increased efficiencies.

     The iGo board of directors believes that the merger is in the best
interests of iGo and its stockholders. In reaching its decision to approve the
merger and the merger agreement, the iGo board considered a number of factors,
including the following:

     - the changing technological and competitive environment in the mobile
       technology industry;

     - the accelerating trend towards consolidation in the mobile technology
       industry;

     - the synergies available to Mobility in cost efficiencies on a
       consolidated basis compared to iGo;

     - access to greater financial and technical resources in support of the
       goals of iGo;

     - the risk that iGo would not have the resources to timely execute its
       business plan when compared to its existing and potential competitors;

     - the opportunity for iGo stockholders to participate in a more
       commercially diversified company such as the combined companies following
       the merger;

     - information relating to iGo's prospects, including the possibility that
       iGo may be required to raise additional capital to attempt to create
       stockholder value in excess of the merger consideration;

     - the Mobility offer represented a premium over the price of iGo stock;

     - the market capitalization, revenues and assets of the combined companies
       as compared to iGo separately;

     - the experience, depth and competence of Mobility's operating team;

     - the strength of Mobility's product development efforts;

     - that iGo may, subject to the merger agreement, terminate the agreement if
       the 30 or 10 day trading average price of the Mobility common stock for
       the period ending two days prior to the effective date of the merger is
       below $1.00 and Mobility does not make certain adjustments to the
       transaction consideration;

     - the willingness of certain iGo stockholders to execute a voting agreement
       in support of the merger and the fact that Mobility was unwilling to sign
       the merger agreement without the voting agreement; and

     - that the amount of and circumstances giving rise to the termination fee
       under the merger agreement was acceptable in the judgment of iGo in light
       of the value of the merger consideration to iGo's stockholders.

INTERESTS OF IGO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     When you are considering the recommendation of iGo's board of directors
with respect to approving the merger and the merger agreement, you should be
aware that some of the directors and executive officers of iGo have interests in
the merger and participate in arrangements that are different from, or are in
addition to, those of iGo stockholders generally. The iGo board of directors was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it
approved the merger and the merger agreement. These additional interests are
described below.

     Indemnification.  iGo has entered into agreements to indemnify its
directors and executive officers, in addition to indemnification provided for in
its bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide for indemnification of
its directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorneys'
fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any
action or proceeding, including any action by or in rights, arising out of such
person's services as a director or executive officer to iGo, any of its
subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides
services at iGo's request. These indemnification rights will survive the merger
and become obligations of the surviving entity and Mobility.

     Accelerated Vesting of iGo Stock Options.  Outstanding but unvested options
under iGo's stock option plan (including options held by directors and executive
officers) will automatically and fully vest prior to the effective date of the
merger. The following table sets forth the number of options that will vest
prior to the effective date of the merger, and the per share exercise price of
such options for the officers and directors of iGo.

                                                                      EXERCISE PRICE
NAME                                                        OPTIONS      PER SHARE
- ----                                                        -------   ---------------

David Olson...............................................  150,000   $0.375
Scott Shackelton..........................................  200,000   $0.69
Miya MacKenzie............................................  173,000   $7.5625-$0.0445(1)
Ejaz Afzal................................................   50,000   $2.75
Rick Blair................................................  200,000   $0.375
Ross Bott.................................................   50,000   $3.69

- ---------------

(1) The amounts stated represent the highest and lowest exercise price per
    share. The specific exercise price per share falls within this range
    depending on the specific option grant.

     Additionally, Darrell Boyle and Peter Gotcher hold certain shares of
outstanding stock subject to a repurchase right by iGo in the event that their
service with iGo terminates. This repurchase right will lapse completely upon
the effective date of the merger. As of March 31, 2002, 20,000 shares held by
Mr. Boyle and 20,946 shares held by Mr. Gotcher were subject to this repurchase
right, which otherwise would lapse over time in monthly increments.

     Employment Arrangements.  David Olson, iGo's Acting Chief Executive Officer
and President, has been offered continued employment at his current rate of pay
until July 31, 2002. Scott Shackelton, iGo's Chief Financial Officer, Senior
Vice President, Finance and Secretary has been offered continued employment at
his current rate of pay until August 15, 2002. If each remains an employee until
those times, Mr. Olson will receive four months of severance pay on July 31,
2002 and Mr. Shackelton will receive five months of severance pay on August 15,
2002. Miya MacKenzie, iGo's Vice President, Marketing, and Ejaz Afzal, iGo's
Vice President, Product Development, each has been offered employment with the
merger subsidiary at their current rate of pay. Mobility intends to provide each
of them with a stock option grant under the Mobility stock option plan. Under
his existing employment agreement, if Mr. Afzal's employment is terminated
without cause prior to such time, he will be entitled to salary and benefit
continuation until August 27, 2002. Rick Blair, iGo's Vice President, Sales, has
been offered continued employment at his current rate of pay until June 30,
2002. If Mr. Blair remains an employee until that time, he shall receive on June
30, 2002 (i) nine (9) weeks of severance pay if iGo's second quarter revenues
exceed $4 million, (ii) twelve (12) weeks of

severance pay if second quarter revenues exceed $4.8 million, (iii) fifteen (15)
weeks of severance pay if second quarter revenues exceed $5.2 million, or
eighteen weeks of severance if second quarter revenues exceed $5.8 million.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     We have attached the merger agreement as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully. We
have summarized the material terms of the merger agreement below.

     Closing.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement will take place on the second business day after the date on which all
the conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived. The closing cannot take
place until after iGo stockholders approve the merger and the merger agreement.

     Effective Time.  The "effective time" of the merger will be as soon as
practicable after the closing when the certificate of merger is filed with and
accepted by the Secretary of State of Delaware.

     Merger Consideration.  At the effective time, each issued and outstanding
share of iGo common stock will be cancelled, and in consideration therefore, the
holders of iGo common stock will be entitled to receive in the aggregate (i) up
to 3,100,000 shares of Mobility common stock, (ii) up to $6,100,000 in cash and
(iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
500,000 shares of the Mobility common stock and $1,000,000 of the cash
consideration will be held back as contingent consideration by Mobility as
described below.

     Hold-Back Provisions.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, 500,000
shares of Mobility common stock and $1,000,000 of the cash to be delivered to
the iGo stockholders as part of the merger consideration will be "held back" as
contingent consideration by Mobility. The amount, if any, of the held back
consideration to be paid to the iGo stockholders will be determined pursuant to
a formula based on collections of iGo accounts receivable and inventory
following the effective time, as adjusted by certain calculations relating to
lease termination payments, sales and use tax liability and iGo balance sheet
thresholds.

     Subject to the noted adjustments, the iGo stockholders will receive out of
the held back consideration an amount, determined based upon the period starting
on the day after the effective time of the merger agreement and ending on the
one year anniversary date of the effective time, equal to 80% of any amount by
which:

     - The sales of iGo's inventory existing at the effective time; plus

     - Any cash collections of iGo's account receivables existing at the
       effective time;

     exceeds the combination of the following, which are called the "Threshold":

     - iGo's gross inventory existing at the effective time; plus

     - iGo's gross account receivables existing at the effective time; less

     - an aggregate reserve of $4,060,924 for inventory and accounts receivable;
       less

     - 1.5% of the dollar amount of iGo's product sales from January 1, 2002
       through the effective time; plus

     - write-offs to reserves for inventory and account receivables made by iGo
       from January 1, 2002 through the effective time.

     If the fees and expenses incurred by iGo in connection with terminating the
Gateway Drive (Reno, Nevada) lease or entering into the second amendment to that
lease are less than $510,000, then, on the one-year anniversary of the effective
time, the iGo stockholders will also receive the amount of the difference out of
the held back consideration. Provided, however, if the sales of iGo's inventory
and the cash collections of iGo's accounts receivables do not exceed the
threshold, then the amount of any shortfall will be subtracted from the hold
back amount otherwise payable to the iGo stockholders with respect to the lease
expenses. Further, if any sales and use tax liability in excess of $100,000 is
assessed against iGo by the State of Nevada

as a result of its audit, then the held back amounts payable to the iGo
stockholders may be reduced by an amount equal to 75% of the excess amount of
the sales and use tax liability. Finally, if iGo's financial statements as of
December 31, 2001 show working capital of less than $2,010,204 (excluding net
receivables and net inventory), then 50% of the deficit shall also be deducted
from any held back amounts payable to the iGo stockholders. As of April 24,
2002, Mobility and iGo have agreed in writing that $12,500 represented 50% of
the deficit from that working capital threshold, which shall be deducted from
any held back amounts payable to the iGo stockholders. The merger agreement,
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A, contains a
worksheet and an example of certain mechanics of the hold back provisions and
the other provisions described in this section. You are encouraged to read the
entire merger agreement, including the exhibits attached to the merger
agreement.

     Certain decisions with respect to the held back consideration and any
disputes relating to the held back consideration or the calculation of any
resulting payments will be made on behalf of iGo's stockholders by a
"representative stockholder" at the direction and upon the determination of a
group of "stockholder representatives." The representative stockholder will
initially be Peter Gotcher, a member of iGo's current board of directors. The
stockholder representatives will initially be the members of iGo's current board
of directors, including Mr. Gotcher. The representative stockholder and any
stockholder representative can be changed by the vote of a majority of the
stockholder representatives.

     Upon written notice from Mobility to the representative stockholder that an
amount is owed under the hold back provisions, the representative stockholder
will elect whether the iGo stockholders will receive shares of Mobility common
stock or cash, or a combination of the two, for any hold back amounts payable
under the merger agreement. The representative stockholder must make the
election to receive cash, stock or a combination thereof in writing within ten
(10) days from the receipt of the written notice, otherwise the manner of
payment will be at Mobility's discretion. To the extent that shares are to be
received for all or a portion of such payment, they will be valued at the
average closing price of Mobility's common stock for the thirty-calendar day
period immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.

     Discontinuation of iGo's Cellular Business.  After the effective time, the
surviving corporation will use reasonable efforts to collect iGo's accounts
receivables and to sell iGo's existing inventory. Mobility and iGo are currently
exploring the sale of iGo's cellular business. In the event that the cellular
business is sold, the surviving corporation must deliver a determination of its
fair market value to the representative stockholder who has 30 days to accept or
reject the amount. If the determination of fair market value is rejected by the
representative stockholder, then the decision of a mutually independent
appraiser will be used.

     Stock Options.  Under iGo's stock option plan, all outstanding stock
options will vest and become fully exercisable prior to the effective time of
the merger. Prior to the effective time, these options must be exercised or they
will be cancelled prior to the merger. In addition, prior to the effective time,
all other outstanding options, warrants and other convertible securities of iGo
which have not been exercised or converted (as applicable) will be cancelled.

     Exchange of Certificates.  At the effective time of the merger, all shares
of iGo common stock will cease to be outstanding and will be cancelled and
retired. The exchange agent for the merger is Mellon Investor Services LLC. As
soon as possible after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will
mail you a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for effecting the
surrender of your certificates formerly representing shares of iGo common stock.
When you surrender your certificates, together with a signed letter of
transmittal, you will receive (i) a certificate representing the number of
shares of Mobility common stock that you are entitled to receive as of the
effective time pursuant to the merger agreement, (ii) a check equal to the
amount of cash you are entitled to receive as of the effective time in exchange
for your shares of iGo common stock and (iii) a check equal to the amount of
cash in lieu of any fractional shares issuable to you as of the effective time
pursuant to the merger agreement.

       respectively, that is not curable within twenty (20) days of the date of
       such circumstance;

     - by iGo if the average closing price of Mobility common stock as quoted on
       the Nasdaq National Market for the thirty-trading-day or ten-trading-day
       periods ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the
       effective time is less than $1.00; unless (i) Mobility agrees to decrease
       the hold back by an amount equal to 3,100,000 multiplied by the
       difference between $1.00 and the average closing price for either the
       thirty-trading-day or ten-trading-day periods, or (ii) Mobility and iGo
       mutually agree in writing on an alternative arrangement.

     Termination Fee.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, iGo may have to

       for 10% or more of the outstanding stock of iGo within 10 days after the
       commencement of such tender offer;

or

     - if both of the following circumstances apply:

      - the merger agreement is terminated by either Mobility or iGo because the
        merger is not completed before August 31, 2002, or subject to
        exceptions, if iGo's stockholders fail to approve the merger and merger
        agreement at the iGo special meeting; and

      - a competitive transaction proposal is commenced and announced or
        communicated to iGo during the term of the merger agreement and within
        18 months following the termination of the merger agreement iGo enters
        into an agreement to consummate, or consummates, such competitive
        transaction proposal (or any other competitive transaction proposal
        commenced in response to or during the pendency of the first competitive
        transaction proposal).

     Upon termination any party also remains liable to the other parties for:

     - any intentional or willful breach of or fraud in connection with the
       merger agreement; and

     - the miscellaneous provisions of the merger agreement.

     Except as described above, each party will pay all fees and expenses it
incurs in the merger.

LOCK-UP AND VOTING AGREEMENT

     Mobility has entered into a lock-up and voting agreement with the members
of iGo's board and certain significant stockholders and executive officers of
iGo who hold, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 33.9% of the
iGo common stock outstanding. The lock-up and voting agreement requires each of
these stockholders of iGo to:

     - vote the stockholder's shares and exercise all consent and similar rights
       in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, each other
       transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and in favor of any
       action required in furtherance of the consummation of the merger;

     - vote against any action which is intended or could reasonably be expected
       to interfere with or materially adversely affect the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     - vote against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
       covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation under the
       merger agreement.

     The lock-up and voting agreement also provides that the stockholders will
not enter into or become subject to any agreement or commitment which would
restrict or in any way impair the obligation of the stockholder to comply with
the terms of the lock-up and voting agreement. In addition, each stockholder
agreed not to sell, assign, transfer or dispose of any of his or her shares of
iGo common stock or enter into a voting trust inconsistent with the lock-up and
voting agreement during the term of the lock-up and voting agreement

     The lock-up and voting agreement terminates at the effective time of the
merger or when the merger agreement terminates according to its terms.

LISTING WITH NASDAQ THE MOBILITY COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     Mobility has agreed to cause the shares of Mobility common stock to be
issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market
before the completion of the merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF IGO COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, iGo common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act.

DISSENTER'S APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, iGo stockholders do not have any right to an appraisal
of the value of their shares in connection with the issuance of shares in the
merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Under the merger agreement, both Mobility and iGo have agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required governmental approvals
and fulfill all applicable regulatory requirements. Neither Mobility nor iGo is
aware, however, of any material federal or state regulatory requirements or
approvals required for completion of the merger, other than filing a certificate
of merger in Delaware at or before the effective time of the merger.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger generally applicable to iGo stockholders. This
discussion is based on existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
existing Treasury Regulations and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change. Any such change, which may or may
not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to Mobility, iGo or the iGo
stockholders as described herein.

     We do not discuss all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or to stockholders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. Factors
that could alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

     - if you are a broker or dealer in securities;

     - if you are an insurance company;

     - if you are a tax-exempt organization;

     - if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Internal Revenue Code;

     - if you are a non-U.S. person or entity;

     - if you are a financial institution or insurance company;

     - if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
       purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions;

     - if you are an investor in a pass-through entity;

     - if you have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

     - if you hold iGo common stock as part of an integrated investment,
       including a "straddle," comprised of shares of iGo common stock and one
       or more other positions; or

     - if you hold iGo common stock subject to the constructive sale provisions
       of Section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code.

     This discussion assumes you hold your shares as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, we do not
discuss the tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax
laws, the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to,
or concurrently with, the merger, whether or not any such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger, including any transaction in which iGo
shares are acquired or shares of Mobility common stock are disposed of, or the
tax consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to acquire
iGo common stock. Accordingly, we

urge you to consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of
the merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax
consequences to you of the merger.

     If "continuity of interest" exists, the merger should be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. In general, continuity of interest exists if a substantial
part of the value of the equity interests in iGo is exchanged for equity
interests in Mobility. Whether continuity of interest exists will depend upon
the value of the Mobility stock issued in the merger and the treatment of the
consideration subject to the hold back of part of the merger consideration
discussed below. Although the Treasury Regulations do not specify the minimum
portion of the consideration to be received by the target stockholders
constituting equity in the acquirer, in John A. Nelson Co. v. Helvering, 296
U.S. 374 (1935), the United States Supreme Court recognized that a
reorganization existed where the consideration consisted of 62% cash and 38%
non-voting preferred stock. In Miller v. Commissioner, 84 F. 2d. 415 (6th Cir.
1936), the Court recognized that a reorganization occurred even though the
equity portion of the purchase price was 25%. There is a risk that the
percentage threshold in Miller would not be followed by the Internal Revenue
Service or other courts.

     The advance ruling guidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service
require that the target stockholders receive stock equal in value to at least
50% of the value of the outstanding stock of the target corporation, determined
as of the effective date of the reorganization. See Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2
C.B. 568. It should be noted that this 50% threshold is the minimum requirement
to obtain an advance ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and is not
necessarily the minimum threshold for continuity of interest to exist.

     The merger agreement provides for the "hold back" of 500,000 shares of
Mobility stock and $1,000,000 of cash as contingent consideration. The
consideration subject to the hold back will be payable to the iGo stockholders
only upon the occurrence of certain contingencies contained in the merger
agreement and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. See "The
Merger -- The Merger Agreement -- Hold Back Provisions" for a discussion of
those terms. The consideration subject to the hold back must be analyzed to
determine its effect on continuity of interest.

     The hold back as it pertains to the Mobility common stock should be
considered "contingent stock." In Rev. Proc. 84-42, the Internal Revenue Service
set forth ruling guidelines for reorganizations that include contingent stock.
One of the factors required under Rev. Proc. 84-42 is that the formula for
calculating the number of shares to be issued under the contingency arrangement
be objective and readily ascertainable. Under the merger agreement, the
determination of whether to receive shares of Mobility common stock or cash
under the hold back will be determined by the Representative Stockholder (as
defined in the merger agreement). Because the amount of stock, if any, to be
received from the hold back will be determined subjectively, it is unlikely that
the ruling guidelines of Rev. Proc. 84-42 are met with respect to the hold back.
Accordingly, it is likely that the Mobility common stock included in the hold
back will constitute boot.

     If the hold back constitutes boot there is uncertainly how it will be
considered in determining continuity of interest. There are several approaches
that could be applied by the Internal Revenue Service or the courts with respect
to the consideration subject to the hold back. One approach is that the
determination of whether continuity of interest exists would be made at the time
of settlement of the hold back, taking into account any property distributed
from the hold back. A second alternative is that the hold back could be valued,
taking into account the likelihood of distributions from the hold back, and
included in the continuity of interest analysis as non-stock consideration. A
third approach is to determine the fair market value of the property subject to
the hold back, and include the full amount in the continuity of interest
calculation as non-stock consideration. A fourth alternative would be to
disregard the consideration subject to the hold back. No controlling authority
exists as to the proper approach for considering the hold back in determining
continuity of interest. Because the first alternative depends upon the
occurrence of future events and the second alternative depends upon the
likelihood of the occurrence of future events, their application is difficult.
Alternatives three and four are used in the examples that follow. If the
consideration subject to the hold back is considered in the continuity of
interest analysis, that is it is not disregarded, continuity of interest may not
exist. However, the existence of continuity of interest will likely depend upon
the value of the Mobility common stock.

     Another factor creating uncertainty as to whether continuity of interest
exists is the time at which the merger consideration will be valued for purposes
of applying the continuity of interest analysis. Rev. Proc. 77-37, for purposes
of applying the 50% safe harbor threshold discussed above, contemplates that the
valuation of the stock will occur at the date of the reorganization. However,
there is no controlling authority establishing the date of reorganization is the
date at which the valuation should occur. If the proper valuation date is the
date of the merger agreement, rather than the effective date of the merger, and
the consideration subject to the hold back is considered non-stock consideration
in the continuity of interest analysis, it is unlikely that continuity of
interest would exist. If the proper valuation date for determining continuity of
interest is the effective date of the merger, whether continuity of interest
exists will depend upon the value of the Mobility common stock at that date.

     Examples.  The following examples illustrate the differing outcomes
depending upon the value of the Mobility common stock, the time at which the
value is determined, and the effect of the hold back. For purposes of these
examples, assume that the value of Mobility's common stock at the effective date
of the merger, is $1.58 per share which was the closing price on April 22, 2002.
Assume also that the value of the Mobility common stock on the date of the
signing of the merger agreement was $1.28 per share which was the closing price
on the last trading day preceding the execution date of the merger agreement.
The hold back covers 500,000 shares of Mobility common stock and $1,000,000 of
cash. Accordingly, in the following examples 2,600,000 shares of Mobility common
stock and $5,100,000 are not subject to the hold back.

          Example 1.  If the contract date, that is March 23, 2002, is the date
     for determining the value of the merger consideration and if the
     consideration subject to the hold back is disregarded entirely, the
     percentage of equity in iGo exchanged for Mobility common stock is
     approximately 39% ([2,600,000 shares X $1.28] / [$5,100,000 + $3,328,000]).
     The Internal Revenue Service may not consider this percentage adequate for
     continuity of interest.

          Example 2.  If the contract date is considered the proper valuation
     date and the entire amount of consideration subject to the hold back is
     considered in determining continuity of interest but is considered
     non-stock consideration, the percentage of equity in iGo exchanged for
     stock in Mobility is approximately 33% ($3,328,000 / [8,428,000 +
     $1,640,000]). It is unlikely that this percentage would establish
     continuity of interest.

          Example 3.  If the effective date of the merger is the proper date for
     determining continuity of interest, and assuming a price of $1.58 per share
     for Mobility common stock, but disregarding the hold back, the percentage
     of equity in iGo exchanged for equity in Mobility is approximately 44.6%
     ([$1.58 X 2,600,000] / [$4,108,000 + $5,100,000]). This percentage probably
     would establish continuity of interest.

          Example 4.  If the effective date of the merger is the proper date for
     determining continuity of interest, and assuming a price of $1.58 per share
     for Mobility common stock and that the entire amount of consideration
     subject to the hold back is included in the calculation as non-stock
     consideration, the percentage of equity interest in iGo exchanged for stock
     in Mobility is approximately 37% ($4,108,000 / [$9,208,000 + $1,790,000]).
     The Internal Revenue Service may assert that this percentage does not
     establish continuity of interest.

     Tax Consequences if Merger is a Reorganization.  If continuity of interest
exists in the merger so that it is considered a reorganization, the merger will
have the following federal income tax consequences for the stockholders of iGo:

     - To the extent that you receive Mobility common stock in exchange for iGo
       common stock, other than stock from the hold back, you will not recognize
       capital gain or loss, but you may recognize dividend income or capital
       gains with respect to the cash payment and any stock or cash you receive
       from the hold back.

     - To the extent that you receive cash in exchange for iGo common stock, the
       gain you recognize will be capital gain unless the exchange "has the
       effect of the distribution of a dividend" in which case you would
       generally have ordinary income. In order to determine whether the
       exchange has the effect of

       the distribution of a dividend, your receipt of cash should be analyzed
       as if, first, you received solely Mobility common stock in exchange for
       your iGo common stock and then the cash paid reduces your Mobility common
       stock, in a taxable redemption, to the number of shares of Mobility
       common stock that you actually received. The deemed redemption will be
       treated as a sale or exchange of the shares and not the distribution of a
       dividend only if the deemed redemption of your Mobility common stock
       satisfies one or more of the provisions of Section 302(b) of the Code.
       This determination is made separately for each stockholder of iGo.
       Assuming that the redemption satisfies the requirements of one or more of
       the provisions of Section 302(b) of the Code and you have held your iGo
       shares for more than 12 months at the time of the merger, any gain on
       such redemption will be a long-term capital gain.

     - If the deemed redemption does not satisfy one or more of the provisions
       of Section 302(b) of the Code, it will be treated as a distribution that
       is subject to Section 301 of the Code. In such case, the cash proceeds
       will be treated first as a dividend (taxed as ordinary income) to the
       extent of iGo's current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time
       of the merger (on a pro rata basis taking into account other Section 301
       distributions made by iGo during the year, including other deemed
       redemptions resulting from the merger that are treated as Section 301
       distributions). To the extent the cash received exceeds your ratable
       share of accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as
       capital gain.

     - Any Mobility common stock that you receive from the hold back will likely
       be treated as boot and subjected to the same analysis described above
       with respect to cash, except such stock will be valued at the fair market
       value of the Mobility common stock when it is received by you. The tax
       basis in such shares will be equal to the fair market value at the date
       you own the shares.

     - A portion of any stock or cash received under the hold back will be
       treated as interest, and therefore taxable at ordinary income rates. In
       allocating interest to any stock received from the hold back, the fair
       market value of the stock at the time it is transferred to the iGo
       stockholders must be determined. This fair market value will be
       discounted to the date of the merger, using the short term applicable
       federal rate at the time of the merger, compounded annually. The
       difference will be considered interest. The same discounting procedure
       will apply to any cash received from the hold back.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the Mobility common stock received by you in
       the merger, (excluding stock under the hold back but including any
       fractional shares of Mobility common stock deemed received and exchanged
       for cash), will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the iGo
       common stock exchanged in the merger, reduced by any amount of cash that
       you receive in the merger for the iGo common stock surrendered, and
       increased by the amount of cash treated as a dividend and the amount
       recognized as a capital gain.

     - The holding period of the Mobility common stock received by you in the
       merger will include the holding period of the iGo common stock
       surrendered in exchange for Mobility common stock.

     Tax Consequences if Merger is Not a Reorganization.  If continuity of
interest does not exist, the merger would not be a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code, and the Internal Revenue Service would likely assert that
the transaction should be treated as if iGo sold all of its assets to Mobility
in a taxable transaction in exchange for stock and cash, and that iGo
subsequently distributed such property to its stockholders in exchange for their
iGo shares. If continuity of interest does not exist, the merger will have the
following federal income tax consequences for the stockholders of iGo if the
Internal Revenue Service attempted to recharacterize the merger as described
above:

     - iGo will recognize gain for federal income tax purposes equal to the
       difference between the fair market value of property, including cash,
       delivered in connection with the merger, plus its liabilities that are
       considered assumed, over iGo's adjusted basis of its assets.

     - The iGo stockholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
       between (i) the fair market value of Mobility common stock received by
       them and any cash received in connection with the merger, over (ii) their
       tax basis of their shares of iGo common stock.

     - A portion of any stock or cash received under the hold back will be
       treated as interest, and therefore taxable at ordinary income rates. In
       allocating interest to any stock received from the hold back, the fair
       market value of the stock at the time it is transferred to the iGo
       stockholders must be determined. This fair market value will be
       discounted to the date of the merger, using the short term applicable
       federal rate at the time of the merger, compounded annually. The
       difference will be considered interest. The same discounting procedure
       will apply to any cash received from the hold back.

     - The tax basis of Mobility common stock received in the merger will equal
       the fair market value of the shares at the date you own the shares.

     - Mobility stockholders will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the
       merger.

     Jackson Walker L.L.P., counsel to Mobility, has opined, that more likely
than not, the merger will not constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Code Section 368(a). In rendering this opinion, counsel assumed that the value
of Mobility common stock for applying the continuity of interest analysis was
$1.58 per share, the closing price on March 23, 2002, and that in valuing the
hold back all consideration would be valued at fair market value using $1.58 per
share for the stock subject to the hold back. No opinion has been expressed if
there is an increase in the foregoing values.

     Neither Mobility nor iGo will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service in connection with the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the
conclusions described above.

     The cash and shares of Mobility common stock issuable to you in the merger
is subject to withholding taxes to the extent required under U.S. federal or
state, local or foreign law. The foregoing summary is for general information
only, and is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed to any
extent as, legal, tax, or financial advice. You are strongly urged to consult
your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you from
the merger in light of your specific circumstances.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Mobility intends to account for the merger using the purchase method.
Mobility will allocate the estimated purchase price to the acquired assets and
assumed liabilities of iGo. To the extent the total purchase price is less than
the historical cost basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
Mobility will record a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would
have been assigned to the acquired assets, except for current assets.

RESALE OF MOBILITY STOCK

     The sale of shares of Mobility common stock issuable in connection with the
merger has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Accordingly, there will be no federal securities law restrictions upon the
resale or transfer of the shares by stockholders, except for those stockholders
who are considered affiliates of Mobility as that term is defined in Rule 144
and Rule 145 adopted under the Securities Act.

     The Mobility common stock received by those stockholders who are considered
to be affiliates of Mobility may be resold without registration only as provided
for by Rule 145 or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. Persons who
may be considered to be affiliates of Mobility generally include individuals or
entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with
Mobility and may include the executive officers and directors of Mobility.

EXPENSES OF THE MERGER

     Except as otherwise provided for by the termination fee arrangement, the
merger agreement provides that all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring the cost or
expense, whether or not the merger is consummated.

                              UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
             CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial
information gives effect to the merger using the purchase method of accounting,
after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying
notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet is
based on the individual balance sheets of Mobility and iGo appearing elsewhere
in this proxy statement/prospectus and have been prepared as if the merger had
been effective on December 31, 2001 after giving effect to the purchase
accounting and other related adjustments. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated statement of operations combines the individual statements
of operations of Mobility and iGo appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus for the year ended December 31, 2001 as if the combination
had taken place on January 1, 2001 after giving effect to the purchase
accounting and other related adjustments.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial information reflects the
application of the purchase method of accounting for the merger. Under this
method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the
closing. Estimates of the fair values of iGo's assets and liabilities have been
combined with recorded values of the assets and liabilities of Mobility.
However, changes to the adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial data are expected as evaluations of assets and liabilities are
completed and as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the
final pro forma combined amounts will differ from those set forth in the
unaudited pro forma combined financial data.

     For the purpose of preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated balance sheet, direct acquisition costs (which the
companies anticipate will be approximately $700,000) were included. The estimate
of direct acquisition costs is preliminary and subject to change.

     Certain financial statement balances of iGo have been reclassified to
conform with Mobility's financial statement presentation.

     The unaudited condensed combined consolidated financial information does
not purport to be indicative of the operating results or the financial position
that would have actually occurred if the merger had been in effect on the dates
indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or
financial position of the merged companies. The pro forma adjustments are based
on the information available as of the date of this Form S-4. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed consolidated information does not give effect to any
cost savings or synergies that may result from the integration of Mobility's and
iGo's operations. No assurances can be given with respect to the ultimate level
of revenues or cost savings. Please read the sections entitled "CAUTIONARY NOTE
ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS" and "RISK FACTORS" for additional information.

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     On March 23, 2002, Mobility and iGo entered into a merger agreement which
will result in iGo becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobility in a
transaction to be accounted for using the purchase method. The total estimated
purchase price of approximately $9,193,000 includes Mobility common stock valued
at $3,393,000, cash of $5,100,000 and estimated direct transaction costs of
$700,000. This estimated purchase price does not include $1,000,000 of cash and
500,000 shares of Mobility common stock included in the merger consideration,
which will be held in escrow as contingent consideration pending the outcome of
certain criteria specified in the merger agreement, until one day following the
first anniversary date of the transaction effective time.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial
statements provide for the issuance of 2,600,000 shares of Mobility common
stock, based upon an exchange ratio of 0.10242 of a share of Mobility common
stock for each share of iGo common stock as of March 28, 2002. This does not
include an additional 500,000 shares being held in escrow as described above.
The average market price per share of Mobility common stock of $1.305 is based
on an average of the closing prices for a range of trading days (March 21, March
22, March 25 and March 26, 2002) around the announcement date (March 23, 2002)
of the proposed merger.

     The estimated total purchase price of the iGo merger is as follows (amounts
in thousands):

Cash consideration..........................................   $5,100
Common stock................................................       26
Additional paid-in capital..................................    3,367
Direct acquisition costs....................................      700
                                                               ------
  Total.....................................................   $9,193
                                                               ======

     Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price
as shown in the table above is allocated to iGo's assets and assumed
liabilities. The historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities of iGo
exceeded the sum of the purchase price allocated to such assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, the excess amount of the cost has been allocated as a pro rata
reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to the acquired
assets except for current assets. The preliminary estimated purchase price is
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows (amounts in
thousands):

     Assets acquired and liabilities assumed:

Current assets..............................................   $13,428
Fixed assets................................................       649
Other Assets................................................       369
Liabilities assumed.........................................    (5,253)
                                                               -------
  Total.....................................................   $ 9,193
                                                               =======

NOTE 2.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     Pro forma adjustments are necessary to allocate the estimated purchase
price to iGo's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon a
preliminary estimate of their fair values. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments for
liabilities resulting from integration planning, as management of Mobility and
iGo are in the process of making these assessments, and estimates of these costs
are not currently known. However, liabilities ultimately will be recorded for
severance or relocation costs related to iGo employees, costs of vacating some
facilities of iGo, or other costs associated with exiting activities of iGo are
not reflected in the pro forma financial statements.

     Mobility has not identified any preacquisition contingencies where the
related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount of the asset,
liability or impairment can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the end of the
purchase price allocation period, if information becomes available which would
indicate it is

probable that such events have occurred and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated, such items will be included in the purchase price allocation.

     The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated financial statements are as follows:

          (a) Adjustment to record cash consideration of $5,100,000 to be paid
     to iGo shareholders.

          (b) Adjustment to allocate the negative goodwill to reduce the
     historical amount of iGo's property and equipment.

          (c) Adjustment to allocate the negative goodwill to reduce the
     historical amount of iGo's other assets.

          (d) Adjustment to write off the historical amount of iGo goodwill.

          (e) Adjustment to record estimated direct acquisition costs.

          (f) Adjustments to stockholders' equity (amounts in thousands):

To record the estimated value of Mobility shares to be
  issued.................................................   $  3,393
To eliminate iGo's historical stockholders' equity.......    (12,303)
                                                            --------
  Total..................................................   $ (8,910)
                                                            ========

          (g) Adjustments to general and administrative expenses (amounts in
     thousands):

To eliminate amortization expense associated with
  historical iGo goodwill, as iGo historical goodwill has
  been written-off to zero value -- see (d)...............   $(3,549)
To record a reduction in depreciation expense resulting
  from the pro forma adjustment to property and equipment
  proportional to the difference between historical value
  and the allocated purchase price of iGo property and
  equipment -- see (b)....................................      (475)
                                                             -------
  Total...................................................   $(4,024)
                                                             =======

NOTE 3.  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS

     As described in Note 16 to the iGo Corporation Consolidated Financial
Statements, during the fourth quarter of 2001, iGo recorded a write-down of
approximately $9,457,000 relating to the impairment of goodwill. The amount of
this write-down is included in general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations of iGo. No pro forma
adjustment has been made for this charge.

NOTE 4.  PRO FORMA LOSS PER SHARE

     Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share are based on the weighted
average number of shares of Mobility common stock outstanding and the weighted
average number of shares of iGo common stock outstanding multiplied by the
exchange ratio.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND THE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS

     PCI Computer Architecture and Split Bridge(R) Technology.  Today the most
prevalent computer architecture, which is incorporated into virtually all
computer systems and in many related embedded processor applications, uses the
peripheral component interface, or PCI, bus. However, the PCI bus has a number
of key limitations, most notably a constraint on the number of lines, or
circuits, and loads that can be attached to it. Historically, these limitations
have been mitigated to some extent by attaching a bridge chip to the PCI bus,
which in turn permits a number of additional loads or peripherals to be attached
to a secondary PCI bus, which is also connected to the bridge chip. This
procedure has the major limitation of requiring the secondary PCI bus to be
located on the main PCI bus printed circuit board, or PCB, or attached
physically by a connector which enables extension of the secondary PCI bus to a
maximum of approximately three inches from the main PCB. Consequently, the
industry today faces a number of physical and electrical constraints when
designing a computer system, and has been unable to move the secondary PCI bus
more than a few inches from the primary PCI bus. Additionally, traditional
communication protocols, such as USB, IEEE 1394, Ethernet and SCSI, which
attempt to address these limitations, have numerous disadvantages since they
generally require a processor, extensive software and other related items.

     Our Split Bridge(R) technology addresses the limitations of traditional PCI
bus technology and architecture by allowing the primary PCI bus of most portable
computer models to be extended to a remote location. This is accomplished
through the use of our Split Bridge(R) chips, which are like any other bridge
chip, except they are divided into two halves separated by a high speed link.
This allows one or more Split Bridge(R) chips to be attached to the primary
computer PCI bus, with the mating Split Bridge(R) chips installed at a remote
location along with the secondary PCI bus. Consequently, our Split Bridge(R)
technology eliminates the requirement of having the secondary PCI bus on the
primary PCI bus PCB, and thus eliminates many of the electrical constraints
thereon. Additionally, Split Bridge(R) technology substantially reduces the
physical space requirements on the primary PCB by eliminating the need for
multiple traditional bridge chip connections and allows the connecting cable to
be small and flexible. The first generation Split Bridge(R) chips were designed
for distances of up to 15 feet. We believe future generations may extend this
distance substantially.

     The following summarizes the advantages of Split Bridge(R) architecture:

     - Gigabit speed

     - Bi-directional

     - PCI superset (transfers bus, not data)

     - Full PCI bus compatibility

     - No processor requirements

     - No storage requirements

     - Minimal size, heat and power requirement

     - Highly upgradeable technology migration path

     - Small, flexible cable

     - Cost effective

     The introduction of Split Bridge(R) technology now enables architectural
designs of computer systems and applications that previously were not feasible.
The implementation of such new solutions can potentially include replacing
current bridge chips with Split Bridge(R) chips, integrating Split Bridge(R)
technology into other chips and technologies or using Split Bridge(R) technology
to create new products and product categories in a variety of potential
applications. We have licensed our Split Bridge(R) technology to a number of
industry parties, including Cybex Computer Products Corporation (d/b/a
Avocent -- Huntsville), 2C Computing, Inc., LSI Logic Corporation, Philips
Semiconductors, Inc., Molex Incorporated, MiTac, International Corporation,
National Instruments Corporation, Asustek Computer Inc., Innolabs Corp. and
Intel Corporation.

  SPLIT BRIDGE(R) DOCKING PRODUCTS

     The portable computer market, which is a rapidly growing segment of the
personal computer industry, could benefit from solutions that address the
inherent limitations on PCI bus architecture. Demand in this market has been
fueled by advances in computer technology and the demand for computer mobility.
According to IDC, a leading industry source, the market for portable computers,
excluding handheld devices, is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth
rate of 10.5% from 26.1 million units in 2001 to approximately 43.0 million
units in 2005. Coupled with this trend toward portability, there has been an
increased demand for portable computers in small and light form factors to
accommodate the user's desire for greater portability convenience when traveling
and/or working in mobile settings.

     Although portable computers provide users maximum portability and
flexibility in mobile settings, portable computers alone are insufficient in
providing users an ideal computing environment for prolonged usage in a fixed
setting, when compared to the comfort of a traditional desktop setup. As a
result, portable computing OEMs created docking products, port replicators and
docking stations, that when used with a portable computer create a workstation
that resembles the setup of a desktop computer. Port replicators are simple
devices that provide users with a cable management system for peripherals such
as full-sized keyboards, power cords, mice and monitors. Docking stations
include basic port replicator features, as well as more advanced capabilities
such as networking, PCI card slots and storage expansion devices. Attaching and
releasing a portable computer from a port replicator or docking station is
typically a one-step procedure that takes seconds to complete compared to the
burdensome task of attaching or releasing each external devices separately. More
important, when used with a full sized keyboard, external mouse, and an external
monitor properly positioned at an ergonomically correct distance, a workstation
is created to maximize user comfort and productivity.

     To date, there has not been a provider of a broadly compatible docking
solution for use with many brands and models. OEMs have historically designed
port replicators and docking stations that restricted use only within their own
brands, and in many cases, for use with only a select number of models. OEM
designed port replicators and docking stations connect to their respective
portable computers via a mechanical connection, which often limits user
flexibility in user workstation setup. The majority of the mechanical port
replicators and docking stations offered by portable computing OEMs also
restrict access to the ports of the notebook

given that their respective devices are designed to merely replicate ports
resident on the respective notebook attached to the device.

     Additionally, many leading portable computer OEMs are removing mechanical
docking connectors from "value" priced portable computers, i.e., portable
computer models typically priced below $1,499 which computers are marketed as
ideal solutions for individuals, education users, and small and medium sized
business use. As a result, these users do not have a docking product option
offered by the respective portable computer OEM.

     We believe that the incorporation of our Split Bridge(R) technology in
CardBus interfaced docking products can provide docking product users greater
functionality and value compared to docking products offered by portable
computing OEMs. Given that Split Bridge(R) extends the PCI bus of portable
computers, Mobility docking products add new hardware ports and offer users
expansion via industry standard drive bays and PCI slots, whereas docking
products from portable computer OEMs merely replicate the functionality on their
respective portable computer attached. Additionally, by using the industry
standard CardBus interface available on majority of portable computers, Mobility
docking products provide users greater flexibility in their workstation setup
without the restrictions of mating a docking product to a proprietary connector.

     Our docking products offer mobile users greater compatibility by using the
industry standard CardBus interface connection to a notebook computer. Given
this type of connectivity, our products are enabled for use with multiple brands
and models, providing broad compatibility greater than traditional mechanical
interfaced docking products offered by portable computing OEMs. Our docking
products also provide a solution for portable computer users lacking an option
from the respective portable computer OEM.

     The primary CardBus interfaced docking product we currently offer is the
EasiDock(R) 1000EV. This product enables users to connect most portable
computers to a docking peripheral at a speed of 1.25+ gigabits, which is
approximately 100 times faster than a USB peripheral. The EasiDock(R) 1000EV
offers users key port replicator functionality providing connectivity via mouse,
keyboard, serial, parallel, and USB ports. Additionally, the EasiDock(R) 1000EV
includes 10/100 base T Ethernet networking and external video support for use
with Windows 98SE, Millennium, 2000, and XP operating systems. We currently
market our EasiDock(R) 1000EV to a variety of distributors, including Ingram
Micro, Inc., and to value added resellers. We also intend to continue to pursue
Split Bridge(R) docking solutions with computer OEMs, which products may be
privately labeled at the request of the OEM.

  POWER PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES

     A major issue for the portable computer user is the requirement to power
their portable computer or handheld device on the road. Many portable devices
offer designs and form factors that support great portability and travel
comfort; however, battery life limits prolonged usage in mobile settings. This
problem is compounded particularly for mobile users that travel frequently via
air or road. Current solutions require the use of multiple, model specific
charging devices for different models, different computing devices, and
different power sources. For the mobile user with several devices such as
notebook computers, mobile phones and PDAs, there is extreme inconvenience to
carry multiple power adapters and having access to a power source.

     Mobile users face several additional issues relating to powering mobile
computing devices. First, mobile devices have limited battery life, which
necessitates the need to frequently connect to a power source to recharge
batteries and negatively impacts productivity. Second, power adapters shipped
with notebook computers only offer power and charging from a wall outlet (AC
source), which limits power source access for mobile users. Truly mobile users
need access to power anywhere and everywhere -- office, air and auto. Third, the
mobile user is inconvenienced given that notebook computers typically provide a
single power adapter. Without a second "travel" adapter mobile users must crawl
under their desks and grab their adapter when they are at home or on the road.
Fourth, there are space constraints for frequent travelers. Mobile users
typically carry a mobile phone and/or a PDA in addition to their notebook
computer. Each device requires a separate power adapter. These adapters consume
valuable space in users' notebook computer bags. Last, power connectors and
device requirements are proprietary. As a result users must typically purchase
their

adapters from notebook computer, mobile phone and PDA manufacturers. This has a
tendency to keep price points artificially high and limit easy access to adapter
solutions.

     We believe that our company is well positioned to provide a variety of
power solutions to mobile computing users. We currently offer a range of DC to
DC, more commonly known as Auto/Air, power adapters that allow mobile computer
users to power their computing device in a car, a boat, or an airplane. Our
current major customers for these products include the computer original
equipment manufacturers or OEMs, such as Compaq Computer Corporation, Gateway,
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, IBM Corporation, Toshiba Corporation and others.
We are also developing a variety of complementary power products that we plan to
introduce in the latter part of 2002.

     In addition to power products, we also market a number of accessory
products, such as monitor stands, portable device bays and portable computer
stands. We expect to increase this offering in the future.

  HANDHELD PRODUCTS

     Today's connectivity devices for handheld PCs, also known as cradles, are
designed to support the handheld PC as a companion product for use with either a
portable or desktop computer. This limited functionality restricts mobile users
who desire to use their handheld PC as their only mobile computing device when
traveling and or communicating to a network. Other challenges facing handheld PC
users is the difficulty of data input and output, the size and quality of the
handheld video display, and connectivity desired to update, share, and present
data.

     Handheld device OEMs, of both PDAs and pocket PCs, offer limited
connectivity options that enable handheld PCs to communicate with networks,
computer peripherals, and display devices without the presence of a portable or
desktop computer.

     We believe that our connectivity and accessory products effectively fill
gaps in the accessory offering of the leading handheld device OEMs, such as
Palm, Handspring and Compaq, among others. We are uniquely positioned to
leverage technology developed internally that enables us to create a flexible
product offering to satisfy a variety of connectivity needs. Our leading
connectivity products for handheld computers provide ethernet and external video
presentation capabilities that are not offered by the handheld device OEMs. We
have enjoyed success with these types of solutions with customers in vertical
markets that deploy handheld devices as a mobile user's primary computing
device. We believe that the outlook for our products in the handheld market is
promising, and our technology is well suited to create both vertical market and
mass market solutions that augment handheld computing as a viable alternative to
portable computing.

     Our current product offering for handheld computers includes cradles that
power the device and connect to the internet over an integrated Ethernet or
modem in the cradle. These products are marketed to major OEMs such as Symbol
Technologies, Inc. and Palm, Inc., and to the distribution channel, as well as
to customers in vertical markets that deploy handheld devices as a mobile user's
primary computing device. We also have products that provide handheld users
external video presentation capabilities that we plan to begin marketing in
mid-2002.

  EXPANSION PRODUCTS

     The PCI bus has become the standard I/O bus on every modern personal
computer, and simply put, one of the most successful bus standards ever
developed. Because of this success, the proliferation of PCI cards has been
nothing short of explosive. As a result, the demand for additional PCI slots for
increased functionality has followed the tremendous growth of PCI card usage. In
addition, the demand for increased portability, flexibility, and performance in
computing has followed the trend of smaller form factors and faster processing
speeds.

     Despite the demands for additional PCI slots and smaller form factors,
computer manufacturers are not increasing the number of PCI slots on their
desktop computers. Even worse, the majority of growth in the personal computing
industry will be driven by the introduction and adoption of more powerful,
portable and flexible laptop computers as primary computer devices which will
replace desktop machines. Because of their

architecture and small form factor, laptop computers do not have any PCI slots,
and thus cannot support the added functionality of PCI cards. In response,
computer users in various industries have become increasingly frustrated with
their computing alternatives.

     Our acquisition of MAGMA in October 2000 solidified our market leadership
position in the PCI expansion business by providing intellectual property,
products, distribution channels, key customers, and additional resources that we
believe will leverage our Split Bridge(R) technology and accelerate our growth
and development in this market segment.

     Our family of PCI expansion products provides users of PCI-based systems
the portability, flexibility, and performance needed for high-end computing
applications. Users in industries such as audio/video editing, test and
measurement, industrial automation, and telephony can now have scalable systems
that could not previously be used in mobile settings because of system
limitations. Hence, our products enable mobility for users and provide computing
power and functionality not previously offered.

     We offer a variety of PCI slot expansion products, ranging from 1 slot to
13 slot configurations, to provide users the expansion lacking in desktop and
portable computing devices. With the recent completion of our second-generation
Split Bridge(R) chips, we began integrating our Split Bridge(R) technology in
the expansion product area. This integration is still underway, and encompasses
the development of new, low cost expansion products, new CardBus expansion
products, and the marketing of Split Bridge(R) links in a variety of
applications including test, measurement and printing. A Split Bridge(R) link
includes two Split Bridge(R) chips, two connectors and a 1.25 gigabit
bi-directional, high-speed cable.

     We currently market our expansion products to a broad range of customers,
including value added reseller and OEMs such as DigiDesign, a division of Avid
Technology, Inc., and Media 100, Inc.

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS

     We have entered into a number of strategic relationships to develop and
enhance our existing and future technology, product lines and market
opportunities. We own or license all of our Split Bridge(R)technology, our
expansion technology, our power product technology, and our card bus and
handheld technology. These relationships include the following:

* These customers purchase from us through distributors

     As a group, the OEMs and distributors listed in the chart above accounted
for 72% and 13%, respectively, of net product sales for the year ended December
31, 2001. Targus accounted for 28% of our total net product sales for the year
ended December 31, 2001. In 2001, Targus distributed a range of our power
products, on a private label basis, primarily to major retail outlets and
certain OEM fulfillment outlets worldwide. However, in December 2001 we came to
an agreement with Targus to terminate our relationship. It is our intention
going forward to market our power products under our own brand through the
distribution channels we have developed. IBM, who buys brand labeled monitor
stands, power products, a portable device bay, and USB docking stations,
accounted for 30% of our net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Our distributors sell a wide range of our products to value-added resellers,
system integrators, cataloguers, major retail outlets and certain OEM
fulfillment outlets worldwide.

SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     We have dedicated, senior level OEM sales people who, along with senior
management, focus on developing and expanding relationships with top tier
computer OEMs on a worldwide basis. We are pursuing the sale of our standard
products, whether Mobility branded or private labeled, and the sale of custom
products and chips on board with OEMs on a worldwide basis.

     In North America, we use an internal sales organization and sales
representative organizations to penetrate the traditional two-tier distribution
channel. We leverage major catalog houses such as CDW Computer Centers, Inc. and
OEM catalog programs such as Dell, top retailers such as CompUSA and Radio Shack
and a broad range of value-added resellers and dealers such as Insight
Enterprises, Inc. and Comark, Inc. We also work with major corporations and key
accounts as part of our strategic efforts.

     We also plan to pursue markets outside North America by establishing
strategic sales representatives and distribution or private label arrangements
in each significant geographic region. We plan to execute bundling programs with
major OEMs, drive manufacturers, selected related vendors and synergistic
suppliers to our market. We have also established an e-commerce capability and
marketing program, which will include, in the future, build-to-order capability.
In Europe, we use an internal sales organization and we distribute our products
through a distributor located in the United Kingdom.

     We implemented a variety of marketing activities in 2001 to aggressively
market our family of products. Such activities included participation in major
user groups and trade shows, key OEM and distribution catalogs, distribution
promotions, value-added reseller and information technology manager advertising,
on-

line advertising and banner ads, direct mail and telemarketing and bundle
advertisements with OEMs and related product partners. In addition, we
implemented a strong public relations program to continually educate the market
about us, our Split Bridge(R) technology and our products, with a major emphasis
on timely product and news releases, speaking opportunities and feature stories.
We also utilize our web site as a major marketing and direct sales mechanism.

MANUFACTURING

     The proprietary components of our Split Bridge(R) technology are
manufactured by our strategic partners. Philips Semiconductors supplies us with
our Split Bridge(R) technology chips, and Molex supplies us with our high-speed
cable and connectors. In the future LSI will supply us with our next generation
chips. Our power products and monitor stands are supplied by contract
manufacturers in Taiwan. Solectron is our primary contract manufacturing source
for our EasiDock(R) 1000EV product.

     Steman currently manufactures all of our Mobility branded monitor stands
and private label monitor stands for our OEM customers. Group West currently
manufactures Mobility's branded and OEM auto/air power adapter products.

     In-house manufacturing activity has primarily been reduced to packaging and
fulfillment activity. Some product is shipped to us in bulk quantities, which is
not packaged for delivery to our customers. We package these products in the
appropriate box with the corresponding operations manual and other product
documentation. We currently assemble one mechanical port replicator under a
contract with NEC and a portable device bay under a contract with IBM. The
volume levels on these products are too small to outsource economically. We will
continue to build these products in-house for the foreseeable future.

COMPETITION

     Competition for our Split Bridge(R) technology primarily comes from
traditional communication protocols, such as USB, IEEE 1394, Ethernet and SCSI.
These protocols are generally well established, particularly in certain
applications, and thus will provide competition for our Split Bridge(R)
technology depending upon the application.

     Additionally, our docking products, handheld products, and accessory
products compete primarily with the internal design efforts of mobile computing
device OEMs. These OEMs, as well as a number of our potential non-OEM
competitors, have larger technical staffs, more established and larger marketing
and sales organizations and significantly greater financial resources than we
have. We believe that we have a proprietary position with respect to our Split
Bridge(R) docking technology, CardBus technology and handheld connectivity
technology, which could pose a competitive barrier for companies seeking to
develop similar products or sell competing products in our markets.

     Our power products primarily compete with third party mobile computing
accessory companies. Although some of these competitors enjoy greater
distribution coverage, we believe that our power technologies and co-development
relationships will enable us to effectively compete against the products offered
by those competitors. We also believe that our technological leadership will
enable us to secure business from many leading mobile computing device OEMs.

     Our expansion products primarily compete with solutions provided by SBS
Communications, a provider of low cost PCI expansion solutions. Our products are
differentiated with cooling performance and chassis durability not offered by
SBS Communications' PCI expansion products. We also license our bridging
technology to SBS Communications for use in several of their PCI expansion
products.

     Generally speaking, the market for computer products in general is
intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product
introductions or enhancements and marketing efforts by industry participants.
The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our product
offerings include corporate and product reputation, innovation with frequent
product enhancement, breadth of integrated product line, product design,
functionality and features, product quality, performance, ease-of-use, support
and price. Although we believe that our products compete favorably with respect
to such factors, there can be no

assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current or
potential competitors, especially those with greater financial, marketing,
service, support, technical or other competitive resources.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our
proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent protection,
copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and
technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have fourteen
patents issued and over forty patents pending pertaining to Split Bridge(R)
technology, CardBus technology, power technology, expansion technology, and
other technology areas. We currently license different aspects of our
proprietary rights to third parties pursuant to strategic alliances, which often
include cross-licensing arrangements.

     We will continue to vigorously pursue patent protection for all our product
categories. We expect to file several new patents relating to handheld
technology in the next year.

     In addition, we currently have eleven United States trademark
registrations, three pending applications for United States trademark
registration, eleven foreign trademark registrations, and twelve pending
applications for foreign trademark registration. We have obtained and are
continuing to seek trademark protection abroad in Brazil, Canada, China, the
European Community, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, and the
United Kingdom. The scope of our trademark protection is comprehensive and
covers all of the company's significant trademarks and service marks.

     We typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees,
distributors, customers and potential customers, and limit access to, and
distribution of, our product design documentation and other proprietary
information. Moreover, we enter into noncompetition agreements with employees,
whereby the employees are prohibited from working for and sharing confidential
information with our competitors for a period of two years after termination of
their employment. Additionally, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of
innovation within the computer industry, the following factors also represent
protection for our technology:

     - technological and creative skill of personnel;

     - knowledge and experience of management;

     - name recognition;

     - maintenance and support of products;

     - the ability to develop, enhance, market and acquire products and
       services; and

     - the establishment of strategic relationships in the industry.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Our future success depends on our ability to enhance existing products and
develop new products that incorporate the latest technological developments. Our
research and development efforts will focus primarily on enhancing our current
technologies for use in a variety of innovative mobile computing solutions. We
work with customers and prospects, as well as partners and industry standards
organizations, to identify and implement new solutions that meet the current and
future needs of our customers. Whenever possible, our products are designed to
meet and drive industry standards to ensure interoperability.

     Currently, our research and development group consists of 34 people who are
responsible for both hardware and software design, test and quality assurance.
Amounts spent on research and development for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999 were $5.6 million, $5.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 2001, we had 126 full-time employees, 122 of which are
located in the United States and 4 of which are located in Europe, including 35
employed in operations, 34 in engineering, 35 in sales and

marketing ad 22 in administration. We engage temporary employees from time to
time to augment our full time employees, generally in operations. None of our
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have
good relationships with our employees.

                             PROPERTIES OF MOBILITY

     Our executive offices and operations are located in Scottsdale, Arizona.
This facility consists of approximately 38,712 square feet of leased space
pursuant to a lease for which the current term expires on January 31, 2003.
Additionally, we lease an office in San Diego, California, which houses the
executive and operational activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary, MAGMA, for
which the current term expires on December 31, 2004. We also lease facilities in
Boise, Idaho and Orange County, California, which house the executive and
operational activities of Portsmith. We believe our facilities are suitable and
adequate for our current business activities for the remainder of the lease
terms.

                         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF MOBILITY

     Mobility Electronics, Inc. v. SBS Technologies, Inc. No. CIV01-0409 PHX JAT
was filed on March 5, 2001 in the United States District Court for the District
of Arizona. In this lawsuit, we allege patent infringement against SBS
Technologies on two patents we own; U.S. Patent No. 6,070,214 entitled "Serially
Linked Bus Bridge for Expanding Access Over a First Bus to a Second Bus" and
U.S. Patent No. 6,088,752 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Exchanging
Information Between Buses and a Portable Computer and Docking Station Through a
Bridge Employing a Serial Link." In our original complaint, we allege that
certain products designed, manufactured and/or sold by SBS infringe these two
patents. SBS has filed an answer denying infringement and a counterclaim seeking
a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of patents and a declaratory judgment
of patent invalidity and unenforceability, as well as tortious interference with
prospective contractual relations. In our answer to SBS's counterclaims we have
denied any such liability. The parties after commencing discovery, have reached
an agreement in principle to settle the case. If the settlement is not
consummated, we intend to vigorously pursue our claims and defend against the
counterclaims.

     Mobility Electronics, Inc. v. Comarco, Inc. and Comarco Wireless
Technologies, Inc. No. CIV01-1489 PHX MHM was filed on August 10, 2001 in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. In this lawsuit, we
allege infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,347,211 entitled "Selectable Output
Power Converter." We have amended our complaint to further seek declaratory
judgments of non-infringement, patent invalidity and/or patent unenforceability
of three patents allegedly owned by Comarco: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,172,884,
6,091,661 and 5,838,554. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, to which
we have responded, and the motion was heard on April 15, 2002. The Court has the
motion under advisement. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this
litigation.

     Richard C. Liggitt v. Portsmith, Inc., et al., Case No. 02CC03308 was filed
on February 22, 2002 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Orange, Central Judicial District. In this lawsuit the plaintiff alleges fraud
in connection with merger negotiations that led to the execution of a merger
agreement between a company owned by the plaintiff and Portsmith, which we
acquired in February 2002. The plaintiff also alleges wrongful termination of
his employment with Portsmith and breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing under his employment agreement with Portsmith. Finally, the
plaintiff alleges that Portsmith was the alter ego of certain of Portsmith's
former directors. The plaintiff is seeking general and special damages, punitive
damages, attorneys' fees and costs. We have filed an answer denying all material
allegations and have asserted a counterclaim for fraud and breach of contract.
This lawsuit is in the initial stages and we cannot express an opinion as to the
outcome of this action. Our failure to express an opinion at this stage should
not be construed as an indication that we believe the defendants may ultimately
be liable for any damages. Mobility intends to vigorously defend itself against
the claims in this lawsuit.

     We are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings other than
those set forth above incidental to the conduct of our business. We believe that
the outcome of all such pending legal proceedings will not in the aggregate have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF MOBILITY

     The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read together with "Selected Consolidated
Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     Mobility Electronics, Inc. designs, develops and markets connectivity
devices and accessories for the computer industry and for a broad range of
related microprocessor applications. Our major focus has been on developing
remote peripheral component interface, or PCI bus, technology and products using
our proprietary Split Bridge(R) technology. We also design, develop and market a
range of other products for portable computers. These products include monitor
stands and in air/in car chargers to power portable computers. To date, our
revenues have come predominantly from monitor stands, in air/in car chargers and
expansion products. We expect revenues from those products to continue and we
also expect to see increasing Split Bridge(R) revenues from both product and
technology sales as we further expand our markets and strategic relationships in
this area.

     In 2001, we completed development of our fundamental Split Bridge(R)
technology and first generation docking products based thereon. As a result, we
have been able to free up resources to capitalize on the emerging opportunities
we have in other areas of our business. Early in 2002, we adopted an evolved
corporate strategy to leverage our strong intellectual property holdings and
unique products to create a broader base of innovative mobile computing
solutions that are natural extensions of our current applications.

     Going forward, our efforts will be centered around four core product lines:
portable computer universal docking products based on Split Bridge(R)
technology; expansion products that increase the functionality and capabilities
of desktop and portable computers; unique products and solutions for powering
and recharging the batteries of portable devices, such as in air/in car
chargers; and innovative products and solutions for handheld computing devices
such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and pocket PCs.

     The PCI bus is the electrical transmission path linking the computer's
central processing unit with its memory and other peripheral devices, such as
modems, disk drives and local area networks, or LANs. Our proprietary Split
Bridge(R) technology consists of a Split Bridge(R) link, typically two
customized semiconductors, known as application-specific integrated circuits, or
ASIC chips, two connectors and a high-speed, bi-directional cable. Our
technology for the first time allows the primary PCI bus of any computer to be
extended to a remote location, up to 17 feet, with virtually no software
requirements or performance degradation, thereby enabling architectural designs
of computer systems and applications that previously were not feasible. We
currently have two Split Bridge(R) patents that are issued by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. Our first major application for Split Bridge(R) technology
has been the creation of a new universal docking product category which allows
users of portable computers to configure a flexible, high performance docking
solution that meets their individual needs. However, we intend to pursue the
further commercialization of Split Bridge(R) technology so that we are able to
expand our product offerings to include additional applications and markets.

     In October 2000, we acquired all of the assets of Mesa Ridge Technologies,
Inc. d/b/a MAGMA, a privately held company. MAGMA provides a range of PCI
expansion products for the computer industry which utilize traditional PCI
bridge technology and MAGMA's patented expansion technology. The acquisition of
MAGMA solidified Mobility's market leadership position in the PCI expansion
business by providing products, distribution channels, key customers, and
additional resources that can leverage our Split Bridge(R) technology and
accelerate our growth and development in this market segment.

     In February 2002, we acquired Portsmith, Inc., an industry leader in
providing connectivity solutions for handheld computing devices. This
acquisition provides us with an entrance into the rapidly growing handheld
computing device market and reinforces our focus on delivering powerful mobile
computing solutions. Portsmith currently provides a range of Ethernet, modem,
and other connectivity products for the most

popular handheld devices such as Palm, Handspring Visor, Compaq IPAQ, and other
mainstream PDA products, and intends to undertake a number of important product
development programs that expand on these solutions.

     We sell our products directly to OEMs and the retail channel, as well as
through distributors. We have also established a few select worldwide private
label accounts, most notably IBM, NEC and Targus. A substantial portion of our
net product sales are concentrated among a number of OEMs, including Compaq,
Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC, Targus and Toshiba. A portion of our sales to
IBM are made through Kingston Technologies, who acts as their fulfillment hub
manager for sales in the United States and Malaysia. Direct sales to OEMs
accounted for approximately 71.9% of net product sales for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and 71.5% of net product sales for the year ended December 31,
2000. Direct sales to OEMs have increased as a percentage of net product sales
as we have successfully promoted our power products and monitor stands in the
OEM market. We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a number of
OEMs for a significant portion of our net product sales in future periods,
although no OEM is presently obligated to purchase a specified amount of
products. Effective December 2001, we came to an agreement with Targus to
terminate our relationship. In the future, we intend to market our products
previously sold through Targus under our own brand directly through distribution
channels we have established and are continuing to develop.

     In March 2002, we announced our execution of a definitive agreement to
acquire iGo Corporation, a leading computer solutions provider. iGo distributes
its products through distributors and directly through its catalog operations
and e-commerce web site, and is a well-recognized brand name in the portable
computer power products and accessories market. We believe the acquisition of
iGo will greatly strengthen our distribution capabilities. The closing of this
transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain material conditions
precedent, including without limitation, approval by the iGo stockholders and
the declared effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a
registration statement which registers the issuance of the shares of our common
stock to be issued to the iGo stockholders in such transaction.

     A portion of our sales to distributors and resellers is generally under
terms that provide for certain stock balancing return privileges and price
protection. Accordingly, we make a provision for estimated sales returns and
other allowances related to those sales using historical experience. Returns,
which have been netted in the product sales presented herein, were approximately
5.5% of net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 5.8% of net
product sales for the year ended December 31, 2000. The major distributors are
allowed to return up to 15% of their prior quarter's purchases under the stock
balancing programs, provided that they place a new order for equal or greater
dollar value of the stock balancing return.

     We derive a significant portion of our net product sales outside the United
States, principally in France, Germany and the United Kingdom, to OEMs,
retailers and a limited number of independent distributors. International sales
accounted for approximately 31% of our net product sales for the year ended
December 31, 2001. We expect product sales outside the United States to continue
to account for a large portion of our future net product sales. International
sales are generally denominated in the currency of our foreign customers. A
decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could
result in a significant decrease in U.S. dollar sales received by us for our
international sales. That risk may be increased as a result of the introduction
in January 1999 of the new "Euro" currency in European countries that are part
of the European Monetary Union, or EMU. During 2002, all EMU countries are
expected to completely replace their national currencies with the Euro. However,
we cannot determine the impact this may have on our business because a
significant amount of uncertainty exists as to the effect the Euro will have on
the marketplace and because all of the final rules and regulations have not yet
been defined and finalized by the European Commission regarding the Euro
currency. We intend to develop and implement a plan to mitigate this risk once
the final rules and regulations are established. We have not engaged in hedging
transactions with respect to our net foreign currency exposure. To the extent
that we implement hedging activities in the future with respect to foreign
currency transactions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in
such hedging activities.

     Various factors have in the past affected and may continue in the future to
affect our gross profits, including but not limited to, our product mix, lower
volume production and higher fixed costs for newly introduced product platforms
and technologies, market acceptance of newly introduced products and the
position of our products in their respective lifecycles. The initial stages of
our product introductions are generally characterized by lower volume
production, which is accompanied by higher costs, especially for specific
products, which are initially purchased in small volumes during the development
lifecycle.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     Our discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make a number of estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, warranty
obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

     We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment and transfer of
ownership from us or contract manufacturer to the customer. Allowances for sales
returns and credits based on historical experience are provided for in the same
period the related sales are recorded. Should the actual return or sales credit
rates differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated allowance for sales
returns and credits may be required.

     Revenue from technology transfer fees, consisting of the licensing and
transferring of Split Bridge(R) and other technology and architecture, and
related training and implementation support services, is recognized over the
term of the respective sales or license agreement. Certain license agreements
contain no stated termination date, whereby we recognize the revenue over the
estimated life of the license. Should the actual life differ from the estimates,
revisions to the estimated life may be required.

  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

     We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance is
assessed on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's
periodic review of the collectibility of the receivable with respect to historic
experience. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required.

  INVENTORIES

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the first-in first-out method. We monitor usage reports to
determine if the carrying value of any items should be adjusted due to lack of
demand for the items. We adjust down the inventory for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

  WARRANTY COSTS

     We provide limited warranties on certain of its products for periods
generally not to exceed three years. We accrue for the estimated cost of
warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The accrual is based on the
Company's actual claims experience. Should actual warranty claim rates, or
service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated
warranty liability would be required.

  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

     To date, our deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount
that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future
taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to
determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future
in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance
and deferred tax benefit would increase income in the period such determination
was made.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the
periods indicated expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods

  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000

     Net product sales.  Net product sales consist of sales of product, net of
returns and allowances. We recognize sales at the time goods are shipped and the
ownership of the goods is transferred to the customer. Allowances for returns
and credits are made in the same period the related sales are recorded. Net
product sales increased 7.8% to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2001 from $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Approximately $3.3
million of the increase was due to sales of PCI expansion products through our
MAGMA subsidiary, which we acquired in October 2000. Approximately $1.9 million
of the increase was due to an increase in sales of our power adapter and monitor
stand product lines. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
approximately $3.0 million in sales of our universal serial bus (USB) docking
products in 2001. We anticipate completely exiting the USB product line during
2002. Due to the termination of our distribution agreement with Targus, Inc. in
December 2001, we anticipate a reduction in sales of our power products in the
first half of 2002. However, we anticipate that the reduction will be offset by
increases in sales of our other products.

     Technology transfer fees.  Technology transfer fees consist of revenue from
the licensing and transferring by the Company of its Split Bridge(R) technology
and architecture. Revenue from technology transfer fees is recognized ratably
over the term of the sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2001,
we recognized a technology transfer fee of $400,000 or 1.4% of total revenues.
Technology transfer fees represented revenue of $2.1 million, or 7.5% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Cost of revenue -- product sales.  Cost of revenue -- product sales
consists primarily of costs associated with components, outsourced manufacturing
and in-house labor associated with assembly, testing, packaging, shipping and
quality assurance, and depreciation of equipment and indirect manufacturing
costs. Cost of revenue -- product sales increased 28.4% to $25.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2000. The increase in cost of revenue -- product sales was due in part to the
7.8% volume increase in net product sales. The balance of the increase was due
to a $3.8 million charge to cost of revenue -- product sales for excess and
obsolete inventory and abandoned tooling. Cost of revenue -- product sales as a
percentage of net product sales increased to 92.0% for the year ended December
31, 2001 from 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding the $3.8
million charge recorded in 2001, cost of revenue -- product sales as a
percentage of net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased
to 78.6% from the 72.2%, excluding a $1.3 million charge to write off obsolete
inventory, for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Cost of revenue -- technology transfer.  Cost of revenue -- technology
transfer consists of engineering expenses related to the Split Bridge(R)
technology. There were no costs of revenue -- technology transfer for the year
ended December 31, 2001, as the technology transfer fees for the period
consisted solely of fees for existing technology. Cost of revenue -- technology
transfer was $200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Gross profit.  Gross profit decreased to 9.3% of total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2001 from 27.8% of total revenue for the year ended December
31, 2000. The gross profit rate decline was the result of the $3.8 million
charge to cost of revenue -- product sales for excess and obsolete inventory and
abandoned tooling, and the decrease in technology transfer fee revenues.
Excluding the $3.8 million charge, gross profit decreased to 22.5% of total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 32.5% of total revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2000 excluding a $1.3 million charge to write off
obsolete inventory.

     Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses generally consist of
salaries, commissions and other personnel related costs of our sales, marketing
and support personnel, advertising, public relations, promotions, printed media
and travel. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 2.3% to $8.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2000. The decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in marketing programs
resulting from our decision to focus our marketing efforts on what we have
deemed to be the most productive sales channels. As a percentage of total
revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 28.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Research and development.  Research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, facilities, outside
consulting, lab costs and travel related costs of our product development group.
Research and development expenses decreased 4.8% to $5.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to
19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 21.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease is due to the reductions in engineering costs,
primarily personnel, in 2001 relating to Split Bridge(R) technology, which was
largely developed during 2000 and the early part of 2001. We expect to see
further decreases in research and development expenses as a result of the
completion of the fundamental development of our Split Bridge(R) technology.

     General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of our finance, human
resources, information systems, corporate development and other administrative
personnel, as well as professional fees, depreciation and amortization and
related expenses. General and administrative expenses also include non-cash
compensation, which is the result of the issuance of common stock, warrants and
stock options at a price deemed to be less than market value to employees and
outside consultants for services rendered, and goodwill amortization which
relates to the acquisition of Magma in October, 2000. General and administrative
expenses increased 47.0% to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001
from $6.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2000. The increase is due
primarily to the write-off of a $3.0 million loan to a strategic partner,
Portsmith, Inc., that we believed had become uncollectible. Excluding the
write-off, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue
increased to 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 24.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2000. As we begin to recognize increased revenues from the
sales of our products, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses,
as a percentage of revenue, will decrease.

     Interest, net.  Interest, net consists primarily of interest earned on our
cash balances and short-term investments, net of interest expense. For the year
ended December 31, 2000, net interest expense consists of interest on our bank
revolving lines of credit and promissory notes as well as our subordinated debt
and convertible debentures, partially offset by interest earned on our cash
balances and short-term investments. Net interest income for year ended December
31, 2001 was $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2000. The change was primarily due to the payoff of debt with our IPO
proceeds during 2000 and interest earned on our IPO proceeds during 2000 and
2001.

     Non-cash deferred loan costs.  Non-cash deferred loan costs decreased to
zero for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease was the result of the balance of deferred loan
costs that were expensed in 2000 when the associated debt was repaid with a
portion of our IPO proceeds.

     Income taxes.  We have incurred losses from inception to date; therefore,
no provision for income taxes was required for the years ended December 31, 2001
or 2000.

  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

     Net product sales.  Net product sales increased 85.7% to $25.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 from $14.0 million for the year ended December
31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to increased sales of power products
and monitor stands to OEM customers. Sales of power products and monitor stands
grew 91.7% to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $8.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, sales of our
universal docking products, which includes products built on USB and Split
Bridge(R) technology platforms, totaled $5.4 million in 2000 following
introduction to the market in December 1999. Other contributors were sales of
Magma's expansion products, which totaled $2.3 million. These increases were
offset in part by a $3.6 million reduction in sales of mechanical docks during
the year 2000.

     Technology transfer fees.  Technology transfer fees represented revenue of
$2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The technology transfer fees
consist of revenue from the licensing and transferring by the Company of its
Split Bridge(R) technology and related training and implementation support
services. The

fees are amortized over the life of the agreements. This represents a new
revenue stream created by the commercialization of our Split Bridge(R)
technology.

     Cost of revenue -- product sales.  Cost of revenue-product sales for the
year ended December 31, 2000 increased 70.3% to $20.0 million from $11.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due to the increase in
net product sales.

     Gross profit.  Gross profit increased to 27.8% of total revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2000 from 15.8% of total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase was due primarily to our decision to outsource
the manufacture of our products. In addition to the cost savings obtained from
outsourcing, the universal docking products, which include products based upon
both USB and Split Bridge(R) technologies have higher gross profit rates.

     Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses increased 59.8% to $8.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $5.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due to the expansion of our internal
infrastructure and increased marketing efforts to promote our new Split
Bridge(R) based products. We added regional sales managers, a telemarketing
group, a customer service group and funded approximately $450,000 in increased
sales efforts by our European representative resulting in a $1.9 million
increase in selling expenses. Our marketing expenses also increased $1.2
million, primarily as a result of an increase in spending on trade shows of
approximately $272,000 and increased advertising of approximately $342,000.

     Research and development.  Research and development expenses increased
74.2% to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $3.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Salaries, related expenses and employee
recruiting increased approximately $786,000 due to increases in general
engineering staffing and the addition of an internal ASIC development team to
pursue the next generation of Split Bridge(R) technology. Prototype expenses
also increased approximately $457,000 as a result of ongoing new product
development. In addition, we wrote off $540,000 of tooling expense and $400,000
in pre-production inventory costs related to an uncompleted product that was
abandoned.

     General and administrative.  General and administrative costs increased
85.6% to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $3.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Approximately $1.5 million of the increase was
attributed to staffing and infrastructure additions to support the higher sales
volume and anticipated launch of the universal connectivity products. Consulting
and legal fees, investor relation expenses and various other filing fees
increased $397,000 as a result of entering the public equity market. Non-cash
expenditures included in general and administrative expenses included $155,000
of goodwill amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of Magma in
October 2000 and an increase in non-cash compensation to $1.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 from $561,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
This increase was due primarily to the write-off of the remaining value of
options issued to consultants that vested fully with the completion of our IPO
in June 2000, as well as to the fact that we recorded a full year's amortization
on employee options, many of which were issued late in 1999.

     Interest, net.  Interest, net increased to $570,000 interest income, net
for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $1.5 million interest expense, net for
the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in interest expense and
corresponding increase in interest income was the result of paying off all our
debt with a portion of our IPO proceeds and investing the remaining proceeds in
interest-bearing accounts.

     Non-cash deferred loan costs.  Non-cash deferred loan costs decreased 47.8%
to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease was the result of 1999 costs being
largely due to the issuance of convertible bridge loan debt that included
warrants which resulted in non-cash deferred loan expense of $4.8 million. No
such debt was issued in 2000, although the balance of deferred loan costs were
all expensed in 2000 when the associated debt was repaid with a portion of our
IPO proceeds.

     Income taxes.  We have incurred losses from inception to date; therefore,
no provision for income taxes was required for the years ended December 31, 2000
or 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     On June 30, 2000, our registration statement on Form S-1 registering our
initial public offering, or IPO, of 4,000,000 shares of common stock became
effective. At the offering price of $12.00 per share, we received proceeds of
approximately $43.1 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and
other expenses, from the IPO. As part of the IPO, we granted the underwriters a
30-day option to purchase up to 600,000 additional shares of common stock to
cover over-allotments, if any. On July 28, 2000, the underwriters exercised
their 30-day option in full and purchased 600,000 additional shares of common
stock, resulting in additional IPO proceeds of approximately $6.7 million, net
of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.

     Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through debt and
equity financing, as the cash consumed by our operating activities has exceeded
cash generated by revenues. Our operating activities used cash of $12.8 million,
$14.2 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was primarily attributed to our net loss and increases in
inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets and reductions in accounts
payable and accrued expenses. Cash used in operating activities was offset, in
part, by a decrease in accounts receivable, non-cash expenses such as
depreciation of property and equipment, write-off of a note receivable, which
has become uncollectible, amortization of deferred compensation and intangibles,
and provision for obsolete inventory.

     Our investing activities used cash of $2.8 million, $6.2 million and $0.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2001, cash used in investing activities was for the
purchase of property and equipment, cash paid for a note receivable which was
written off in its entirety during the year ended December 31, 2001, and cash
paid to exercise a stock purchase warrant.

     Our net financing activities used cash of $17,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and generated cash of $46.0 million and $14.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net cash used in financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily used to pay down
capital lease obligations.

     Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $14.8 million at December 31,
2001 compared to $30.4 million at December 31, 2000. Our net working capital at
those same dates was $19.4 million and $37.0 million, respectively. At December
31, 2001 our available sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents.

     Our future capital requirements include funding operations, financing the
growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventories, and
the purchase of equipment and fixtures to accomplish future growth. We believe
that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our
expected cash and working capital requirements for the next twelve months.

     At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $65.0 million of federal,
foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards which expire at various
dates. We anticipate that the sale of common stock in the IPO coupled with prior
sales of common stock will cause an annual limitation on the use of our net
operating loss carryforwards pursuant to the change in ownership provisions of
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This limitation is
expected to have a material effect on the timing of our ability to use the net
operating loss carryforward in the future. Additionally, our ability to use the
net operating loss carryforward is dependent upon our level of future
profitability, which cannot be determined.

     At December 31, 2001, we had future commitments relating to various
non-cancelable operating leases totaling $1.0 million dollars, payable over the
next three years, with $0.6 million payable in 2003, $0.2 million payable in
2004, and $0.2 million payable in 2005.

INFLATION

     We do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our operations.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations
("Statement 141"), and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
("Statement 142"). Statement 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting
be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as
all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001.
Statement 141 also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase
method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from
goodwill, noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may
not be accounted for separately. Statement 142 will require that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions of Statement 142. Statement 142 will also require that intangible
assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated
useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

     We adopted the provisions of Statement 141 effective July 1, 2001, and
Statement 142 effective January 1, 2002. Furthermore, any goodwill and any
intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired
in a purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001 will not be
amortized, but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with
the appropriate pre-Statement 142 accounting literature. Goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 will
continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of Statement 142.

     Statement 141 requires upon adoption of Statement 142, that we evaluate our
existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase
business combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to
conform with the new criteria in Statement 141 for recognition apart from
goodwill. Upon adoption of Statement 142, we will be required to reassess the
useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase
business combinations, and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by
the end of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent
an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life, we will
be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of Statement 142 within the first interim period. Any impairment loss
will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period.

     In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation,
Statement 142 will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an
indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish
this we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of
each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the
existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date
of adoption. We will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to
determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting
unit's carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds
its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be
impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment
test. In the second step, we must compare the implied fair value of the
reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair
value to all of it assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a
manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with Statement 141,
to its carrying amount, both of which would be measured as of the date of
adoption. This second step is required to be completed as soon as possible, but
no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss
will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
in our statement of operations.

     Finally, any unamortized negative goodwill existing at the date Statement
142 is adopted must be written off as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.

     As of December 31, 2001, we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of $5.6
million, and we will have no unamortized identifiable intangible assets and no
unamortized negative goodwill. Amortization expense related to goodwill was
$621,000 and $155,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting
Statements 141 and 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact
of adopting these Statements on our financial statements at the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus, including whether any transitional impairment losses
will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations ("Statement 143"). Statement 143 requires that the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the
period in which it is incurred. We are required to adopt the provisions of
Statement 143 as of January 1, 2003. The adoption of Statement 143 is not
expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("Statement 144"). Statement 144
supercedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. Statement 144 also
supercedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. However,
it retains the requirement in Opinion No. 30 to report separately discontinued
operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either
has been disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or
is classified as held for sale. We are required to adopt the provisions of
Statement 144 as of January 1, 2002. The adoption of Statement 144 is not
expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The above discussions contain forward-looking statements based on current
expectations, and we assume no obligation to update these statements. Because
actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not
to place undue reliance on these statements. These statements are based on our
estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions, and are not guarantees of
future performance. A number of factors could cause future results to differ
materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently
expected or sought by us. These factors include: reduced demand for our
products; the loss of one or more of our significant customers; an inability to
increase our market share; difficulties in maintaining our technology and
supplier alliances; and a continued downturn in general economic conditions.

     These factors and the other matters discussed above under the heading
"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" may cause future
results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or
outcomes we currently expect or seek.

           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course or our
business. These risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates. In addition, our international operations are subject
to risks related to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate,
differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions.

     To date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative
commodity instruments. We do not expect to employ these or other strategies to
hedge market risk in the foreseeable future. We invest our cash in money market
funds, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk. We believe that the
market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial.

                    DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF MOBILITY

GENERAL

     Mobility is a Delaware corporation and its affairs are governed by its
certificate of incorporation, as amended, its bylaws, as amended, and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). The following description of its
capital stock is qualified in all respects by the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws.

     As of December 31, 2001, the authorized capital stock of Mobility consisted
of 90,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 15,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

COMMON STOCK

     As of December 31, 2001, Mobility had 15,128,641 shares of common stock
outstanding and approximately 440 holders of common stock. All issued and
outstanding common stock is, and all shares of common stock to be outstanding
upon completion of this offering will be, fully paid and nonassessable. Holders
of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters
submitted to a vote of Mobility's stockholders. There is no right to cumulative
voting for the election of directors. Holders of shares of common stock are
entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors
out of funds legally available therefore, after payment of dividends required to
be paid on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Upon Mobility's
liquidation, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to share ratably in
all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to the liquidation
preferences of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of shares of
common stock have no conversion, redemption or preemptive rights. The rights of
the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected
by, the rights of the holders of preferred stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

     The board of directors may, without further action of our common
stockholders, issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and fix or
alter the rights and preferences thereof, including the voting rights,
redemption provisions (including sinking fund provisions), dividend rights,
dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and any other rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of any wholly unissued series of
preferred stock. The board of directors may, without further action by our
common stockholders, issue shares of preferred stock which it has designated.

     The rights of holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be
adversely affected by, the rights of holders of preferred stock. While the
issuance of preferred stock provides flexibility in connection with additional
financing, possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, future issuances
may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing the change of control
in us without further action by the stockholders and may discourage bids for the
common stock at a premium over the market price. The board of directors may,
without stockholder approval, provide for the issuance of preferred stock that
could have voting, conversion or other rights superior to the rights of holders
of common stock.

     We have no present plans to issue any new series of preferred stock.

SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK

     As of December 31, 2001, Mobility had 4,500,000 shares of Series C
preferred stock authorized for issuance and 682,659 shares of Series C preferred
stock outstanding. All issued and outstanding Series C preferred stock is, and
all shares of Series C preferred stock to be outstanding upon completion of this
offering will be, fully paid and nonassessable.

     The Series C preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock.
The rate of conversion is 1 to .74385 as of February 21, 2002. The initial
conversion rate was one for one, but was subject to change if certain events
occur. Generally, the conversion rate will be adjusted if Mobility issues any
non-cash dividends on our securities, split our securities or otherwise effect a
change to the number of our outstanding securities. The adjustment in each of
these cases will be such that the revised conversion rate would result in the
issuance

to the Series C stockholder the same number of common shares to which the holder
would have been entitled immediately after the occurrence of such event had he
converted his Series C shares into common shares immediately prior to the event.

     For example, if the conversion rate was 1-to-0.75 immediately prior to a
2-for-1 stock split, the rate would be multiplied by two and would become
1-to-1.5 immediately after the split. Therefore, if the holder of 2,000 Series C
shares had converted his shares into common stock immediately before the split,
he would have received 1,500 shares of common stock which would then have been
split into 3,000 shares. If he converts his Series C shares after the split, the
adjusted conversion rate of 1-to-1.5 will also result in the stockholder
receiving the same 3,000 shares of common stock. The conversion rate will also
be adjusted if Mobility issues additional securities at a price that is less
than the price that the Series C preferred stockholders paid for their shares.
This adjustment will be such that the new conversion rate will give the Series C
stockholders in the aggregate the same percentage ownership immediately after
the offering as they would have had the new securities been issued at the same
price the Series C stockholders paid for their shares. The new conversion rate
is calculated by multiplying the conversion rate immediately prior to the sale
by a fraction determined by dividing (1) the common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the sale, including the common shares underlying the Series
C, plus the new shares issued by (2) the common stock outstanding immediately
prior the sale, including the common shares underlying the Series C, plus the
number of new shares that the aggregate proceeds received for the new issue
would have purchased at the per share price in effect for the Series C stock
immediately prior to the new issuance. For example, assume that 100,000 Series C
shares were sold at $12 per share and are all still outstanding with a
conversion rate of 1-to-1. Further assume that the Company now sells 50,000
common shares at a price of $9 per share, or total aggregate proceeds of
$450,000 (50,000 X $9). The Series C Preferred conversion rate would be adjusted
as follows: 1 X (100,000 + 50,000)/(100,000 + (450,000/12)), or a new rate of
1-to-1.09091. The Series C preferred stock can be converted at any time at the
option of the holder. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion.

     If Mobility's board of directors declares a cash dividend payable on it's
outstanding shares of common stock, the board of directors must also declare a
dividend payable on each share of Series C preferred stock equal to the amount
of the dividend payable on the number of shares of common stock into which each
such share could then be converted. Holders of shares of Series C preferred
stock are entitled to vote on all matters submitted for a vote of the holders of
common stock. Holders will be entitled to one vote for each share of common
stock into which one share of Series C preferred stock could then be converted.

     In the event of Mobility's liquidation or dissolution, the holders of
Series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive the amount they paid for
their stock, plus accrued and unpaid dividends out of our assets legally
available for such payments prior to the time other holders of our securities
junior to the Series C preferred stock will be entitled to any payments.
Mobility is restricted from undertaking the following corporate actions without
the consent of the Series C preferred stockholders while any shares of Series C
preferred stock remain outstanding: (i) merging, selling all or substantially
all of its assets or liquidating unless the holders of Series C preferred stock
receive at least $15.00 per share; (ii) purchasing any common stock, except for
purchases of shares under contractual arrangements; (iii) authorizing or issuing
any equity securities senior to or on parity with the Series C preferred stock;
(iv) declaring or paying any cash dividends on the common stock; or (v)
increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of preferred stock or
common stock.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     We have standing audit and compensation committees as described below. The
board as a whole performs the duties of a nominating committee.

     Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee of the board consists
of Messrs. Dilworth, Stead and Hunt. The Compensation Committee makes
recommendations to the board concerning salaries and incentive compensation for
our executive officers, directors, employees and consultants and administers our
1996 Plan and our Discretionary Bonus Plan. The Compensation Committee met five
times during the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee of the board consists of Messrs.
Carr, Harris and Dilworth. The board has determined that each member is an
independent director within the meaning of the listing standards of Nasdaq and
is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. The board has
also

determined that at least one member of the Audit Committee has past employment
experience in finance or accounting. The Audit Committee aids management in the
establishment and supervision of our financial controls, evaluates the scope of
the annual audit, reviews audit results, makes recommendations to our board
regarding the selection of independent auditors, consults with management and
our independent auditors prior to the presentation of financial statements to
stockholders and, as appropriate, initiates inquiries into aspects of our
financial affairs. The board has reviewed, assessed the adequacy of, and adopted
a written charter for the Audit Committee. A copy of the charter was filed as an
Appendix to our proxy statement for our annual meeting held in 2001. The Audit
Committee met four times during the year ended December 31, 2001.

                    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

GENERAL COMPENSATION PROCEDURES AND POLICIES

     Our executive compensation plans have been designed to attract, retain and
reward high caliber executives who will formulate and execute our business plans
in a manner that will provide our stockholders with a higher than average return
on our common stock while ensuring that our compensation levels are fair and
appropriate to both our executives and stockholders. With these goals in mind,
our compensation plans and policies have been designed to have total
compensation linked significantly with our operating performance. Although the
Compensation Committee recognizes that the improvement of operating performance
and higher stock prices do not necessarily move in tandem over the short term,
the Compensation Committee believes that the two criteria will correlate over
the long term.

     The Compensation Committee does not expect to pay above-average base
salaries to its executive officers, but does expect to use performance-oriented
and equity-based compensation to reward positive performance and results.

     The Compensation Committee also supports the position that stock ownership
by our executive officers, encouraged by equity-based compensation plans, aligns
the interests of the executive officers with those of our stockholders. By using
equity-based compensation over a period of time, our executive officers should
become larger holders of common stock. This is intended to strengthen their
identification with our stockholders and make increasing stockholder value an
even more important focus for our management group. In addition, the
Compensation Committee believes that the use of equity-based compensation
combined with a focus on our operating performance will create a balance of
these two long-term objectives.

     Our compensation policy applicable to the chief executive officer as well
as the other executive officers reflects the following general goals and
objectives:

     - to encourage growth and create increased stockholder value by the
       efficient use of corporate assets;

     - to recognize the contribution exceptional management makes;

     - to provide the framework, as a component of the total compensation
       program, to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management
       personnel; and

     - to develop performance criteria measuring revenue growth, profit and loss
       performance and other qualitative factors.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     For the last completed fiscal year, Mr. Mollo's compensation, as well as
that of the other executive officers, was based upon the following factors and
criteria:

     - achievement of our sales plan;

     - achievement of our operating income plan;

     - achievement of our operating cash flow (EBITDA) plan;

     - achievement of our year-end cash balance target; and

     - discretionary measures based on managerial effectiveness, including (a)
       leadership exhibited through relationships with customers, vendors,
       employees and stockholders; (b) planning and execution of operations,
       including strategic and financial plans; (c) service to customers; (d)
       new product and market development; (e) productivity factors; (f) special
       problem handling and solving; and (g) overall organization and
       administrative management effectiveness.

     We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Mollo as described
under "Employment Agreements" below. As of December 31, 2001, Mr. Mollo's base
salary was $240,750. His salary will automatically be increased $25,000 per
year. Mr. Mollo has a targeted annual cash bonus, for each fiscal year that the
agreement is in effect, of up to 70% of his then current base salary. Under the
terms of his employment agreement, in 1999 we granted Mr. Mollo the option to
purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock at $4.00 per share under our 1996
Plan. This option expires on December 1, 2004 or one year following the
termination of Mr. Mollo's employment agreement.

                                          By the Compensation Committee:
                                          Robert P. Dilworth
                                          William O. Hunt
                                          Jerre L. Stead

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Each director who is also our employee does not receive additional
compensation for serving as a director. Currently, each non-employee director,
upon initial election to the board, receives a non-qualified option to purchase
50,000 shares of common stock, which vests quarterly over a three-year period
commencing on the date of grant. In addition, each non-employee director
receives a non-qualified option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock
immediately following each time the non-employee director is re-elected, which
option vests quarterly over a three-year period commencing on the date of grant.
At each annual meeting of our directors, each non-employee director who is
elected to serve on either the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee
receives an option to purchase 2,500 shares of common stock, which option vests
quarterly over a one-year period commencing on the date of grant. Each
non-employee director serving as chairman of a committee receives an option to
purchase 1,000 shares, which option vests quarterly over a one-year period
commencing on the date of grant. The exercise price for options granted to
non-employee directors is the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of the grant and vesting occurs only upon continuous service as a non-employee
director. Directors may also be reimbursed for certain expenses in connection
with attendance at board and committee meetings.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Neither Messrs. Dilworth, Hunt nor Stead, who are members of our
Compensation Committee, has at any time been one of our officers or employees.
None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board or compensation
committee of any entity which has one or more executive officers serving as a
member of our board or Compensation Committee. For a description of the
transactions between us and any member of the Compensation Committee and
entities affiliated with any Compensation Committee member, see "Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions" below.

DISCRETIONARY BONUS PLAN

     In order to succeed, we believe that we must be able to attract and retain
qualified personnel by developing base compensation and bonus packages that are
in line with comparable companies. The Compensation Committee is responsible for
administering and interpreting our Discretionary Bonus Plan, determining
eligibility thereunder, approving performance goals and plans, and recommending
bonus awards subject to final approval by our Directors. The participants in the
Discretionary Bonus Plan, including our executive officers, subsidiary and
division general managers, and other selected personnel, are eligible for annual
awards under the Discretionary Bonus Plan, as a percentage of base compensation,
of up to 70% for the Chief Executive Officer, and ranging from 25% to 50% for
other executive officers and selected personnel. The bonus percentage amounts
may be modified quarterly or from time to time by our Directors based upon the
financial plan for the upcoming quarter, and the recommendation of the
Compensation Committee.

     The determination of awards under the Discretionary Bonus Plan will take
into account input from our senior management who will consider, among other
things, one or more of the following goals:

     - Encouraging our growth and creating increased stockholder value through
       the efficient use of assets;

     - Recognizing the contribution of exceptional management, and awarding
       discretionary bonuses for extraordinary performance; and

     - Providing incentives and rewards, as a component of the total
       compensation program, to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified
       management personnel.

     To achieve these goals, we integrate base compensation with bonuses based
upon a variety of factors that include our operating performance as a company,
as well as each participant's individual initiative and performance. In
determining whether to award bonuses under the Discretionary Bonus Plan, the
Compensation Committee will specifically consider, among other things, (i) the
achievement of a quarterly sales plan, (ii) the achievement of a quarterly
operating cash flow (EBITDA) plan, (iii) the achievement of a quarterly cash
balance target, and (iv) a variety of other factors including, but not limited
to, an assessment of each participant's leadership ability, planning and
execution of operations, service to customers, product and market development,
and overall productivity. The Compensation Committee will apply, on a quarterly
basis, a formula assigning weights to the above-outlined performance criteria,
in order to highlight our primary objectives for that quarter.

     In order to be eligible for a bonus award in any given calendar quarter,
participants must be employed with us as of the last day of such calendar
quarter (with certain limited exceptions). Our directors may elect to award
bonuses in cash or in our stock. If payment is made in stock, the stock price
will be established by our directors at the time the bonus is approved.

BOARD REPORT ON OPTIONS CANCELLATIONS AND ISSUANCES

     On July 18, 2001, the Compensation Committee cancelled options to purchase
10,000 and 110,000 options granted to Ms. Brubacher and Mr. Johnson,
respectively. The exercise price of those options were $12.00 and $11.00,
respectively. Additionally, effective September 2001, the Compensation Committee
granted to employees, including the named Executive Officers (although Mr.
Johnson did not participate), the option of retaining their current option
position under the 1996 Plan, or canceling such options, in which event such
option holder was granted options in March 2002 to acquire 80% of the shares of
common stock underlying the cancelled options at the fair market value as of the
date of such grant. The exercise prices of the options which are the subject of
such cancellation, which have generally been equal to or greater than the fair
market value at the date of grant, have ranged from $12.00 to $1.28. The
Compensation Committee and the board of directors recognized that certain events
beyond the reasonable control of the employees of the Company had significantly
reduced the incentive these options were intended to create. It was the
expectation of the Compensation Committee and the board of directors that by
issuing new options, the intended incentive would be restored in part.

     The following table provides information concerning the cancellation and
issuance of certain stock options granted to our Named Executive Officers under
the 1996 Plan as required by Regulation S-K:

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     We have entered into employment agreements with Ms. Brubacher and Messrs.
Mollo, Doss and Johnson. The agreements with Messrs. Mollo and Doss expired on
December 1, 2001, but were automatically renewed for an additional one year
period according to the terms of each agreement. The agreement with Ms.
Brubacher expires on August 14, 2003. The agreement with Mr. Johnson expires
April 1, 2003. Each of these employment agreements is automatically renewed on a
year-to-year basis at the end of its then-current term, unless either party to
the agreement gives the other party notice of termination at least 90 days prior
to the end of the then current term. The employment agreements provide for
increases in salary as determined by the board of directors.

     As of December 31, 2001, Mr. Mollo's base salary was $240,750. His salary
will automatically be increased $25,000 per year. Mr. Mollo has a targeted
annual cash bonus, for each fiscal year that the agreement is in effect, of up
to 70% of his then current base salary. In 1999, under the terms of his
employment agreement, we granted Mr. Mollo the option to purchase 100,000 shares
of our common stock at $4.00 per share under our 1996 Plan. This option expires
on December 1, 2004 or one year following the termination of Mr. Mollo's
employment agreement. In September 2001, we cancelled options previously granted
to Mr. Mollo to purchase 8,333 shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share
and we granted Mr. Mollo options in March 2002 to purchase 6,666 shares at an
exercise price of $1.27 per share. See "Board Report on Options Cancellations
and Issuances." These options expire on March 22, 2006.

     As of December 31, 2001, Mr. Doss's base salary is $192,600. Mr. Doss has a
targeted annual increase in salary of at least 7% which will take effect each
year on December 1. Mr. Doss has a targeted annual cash

bonus, for each fiscal year that the agreement is in effect, of up to 50% of his
then current base salary. In 1999, under the terms of his employment agreement,
we granted Mr. Doss the option to purchase 75,000 shares of our common stock at
$4.00 per share under our 1996 Plan. This option expires on the earlier of March
31, 2003 or 180 days following the termination of Mr. Doss's employment
agreement. In September 2001, we cancelled options granted to Mr. Doss to
purchase 8,333 shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share and we granted
options in March 2002 to Mr. Doss to purchase 6,666 shares at an exercise price
of $1.27 per share. See "Board Report on Options Cancellations and Issuances."
These options expire on March 22, 2006. Pursuant to Mr. Doss's employment
agreement, we sold to him 50,000 shares of our Series C preferred stock at a
purchase price of $6.00 per share and issued Mr. Doss a warrant to purchase
50,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share. In
return, Mr. Doss provided us with a promissory note and an agreement pledging
his 50,000 shares of Series C preferred stock and his warrant to purchase (and
the underlying) 50,000 shares of common stock to us. The above promissory note
was due and payable on December 1, 2001, with pre-payments required for any cash
bonuses, however, we waived such pre-payment with respect to a $69,874 bonus
paid to Mr. Doss in 2001, and have extended such maturity date until November
30, 2002.

     If we terminate our employment agreement with Mr. Mollo or Mr. Doss for any
reason other than just cause, as defined in the agreement, within two years of
experiencing a change in control, as defined in the agreement, we will, in the
case of Mr. Mollo, pay a lump-sum payment equal to his then current salary for
the remainder of the then current term of the agreement or, in the case of Mr.
Doss, continue to pay his then current salary for the remainder of the then
current term of his employment agreement plus one year. If Mr. Mollo or Mr. Doss
terminates his employment agreement with us for constructive termination, as
defined in the agreement, within two years of the time that we experience a
change in control, as defined in the agreement, we will, in the case of Mr.
Mollo, also pay him a lump-sum payment equal to his then current salary for the
remainder of the then current term of his employment agreement or, in the case
of Mr. Doss, continue to pay his then current salary for the remainder of the
then current term of his employment agreement plus one year.

     We have agreed to consult with Mr. Doss regarding any change of our current
chief executive officer. If Mr. Doss does not approve of the new chief executive
officer, he is entitled to terminate his employment with us within thirty days
of the time the new chief executive officer takes office. Mr. Doss will retain
the compensation he has earned until that point and we will pay to Mr. Doss a
lump-sum equal to three months of his then current salary.

     As of December 31, 2001, Ms. Brubacher's base salary was $150,000, but was
increased to $169,500 on January 1, 2002. Ms. Brubacher has a targeted annual
calendar year cash bonus of 50% of her then current salary. Under the terms of
her employment agreement in March 2002, we granted Ms. Brubacher the option to
purchase 20,000 shares of our common stock at $1.27 per share under our 1996
Plan. This option vests and becomes exercisable over a period of three years
from the date of grant and expires on March 22, 2007, unless it expires earlier
due to Ms. Brubacher terminating her employment with us. In January 2000, we
issued options to Ms. Brubacher to purchase 10,000 shares at an exercise price
of $12.00 per share. In January 2001, we granted to Ms. Brubacher options to
purchase an additional 10,000 shares at an exercise price of $3.15 per share.
These options expire on January 17, 2006. In July 2001, we cancelled the options
granted to Ms. Brubacher in January 2000. In September 2001, we cancelled
options previously granted to Ms. Brubacher to purchase 19,600 shares at
exercise prices ranging from of $11.50 per share to $4.00 per share. In March
2002, we granted various options to Ms. Brubacher to purchase 15,600 shares at
an exercise price of $1.27 per share. The options to purchase the 15,600 shares
expire on March 22, 2006. See "Board Report on Options Cancellations and
Issuances."

     As of December 31, 2001, Mr. Johnson's base salary is $235,400. Mr. Johnson
has a targeted annual calendar year bonus of 50% of his then current salary.
Under the terms of his employment agreement, we granted Mr. Johnson options to
purchase 110,000 shares of our common stock at $11.00 per share under our 1996
Plan. In addition, on January 17, 2001 we granted Mr. Johnson options to
purchase 110,000 shares at an exercise price of $3.15 per share. This option
vests and becomes exercisable over a period of three years beginning January 17,
2001 and expires January 17, 2007, unless it expires earlier due to Mr.
Johnson's

termination of employment with us. In July 2001, we cancelled the original
options granted to Mr. Johnson to purchase 110,000 shares at an exercise price
of $11.00 per share. If we terminate our employment agreement with Mr. Johnson
for any reason other than just cause, as defined in the agreement, or if Mr.
Johnson terminates the agreement with us for constructive termination, as
defined in the agreement, within two years of experiencing a change in control,
as defined in the agreement, we will pay a lump-sum payment equal to his then
current salary for the remainder of the then current term of the agreement.

  *  Represents beneficial ownership of less than 1%

 (1) "Beneficially" owned shares, as defined by the SEC, are those shares as to
     which a person has voting or dispositive power, or both. "Beneficial"
     ownership does not necessarily mean that the named person is entitled to
     receive the dividends on, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares.

 (2) For purposes of calculating the number of shares beneficially owned by a
     stockholder and the percentage ownership of that stockholder, shares of
     common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or
     exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2002 by that stockholder are deemed
     outstanding. Percentage ownership is based on 16,083,166 shares of common
     stock, including 400,000 shares held in escrow, and 623,954 shares of
     Series C preferred stock, which converts to 464,128 shares of common stock
     using a conversion factor of 1-to-0.74385, outstanding as of March 31,
     2002. Additionally, for calculating the shares percentage of shares
     beneficially owned after the merger, the maximum number of shares of
     Mobility common stock issuable to the iGo stockholders (3,100,000) has been
     included in the calculation.

                                BUSINESS OF IGO

OVERVIEW

     Founded in 1993, and headquartered in Reno, Nevada, iGo Corporation
designs, develops and markets accessories including batteries, adapters and
chargers for mobile technology products such as notebook computers, cell phones
and wireless devices. iGo's products address the needs of mobile professionals
as well as corporations with mobile workforces who demand solutions to keep them
powered up and connected. iGo develops its own line of mobile accessories under
the Xtend and Road Warrior brands.

     iGo's Road Warrior and Xtend brands are recognized for top quality notebook
computer and cellular products as well as travel solutions. Each
precision-engineered product meets or exceeds industry standards for quality,
innovation, performance and ease of use. iGo products help make business
travelers' time in the air, and on the road, easier and more productive.

     iGo's products are available toll-free and online. They are also sold
through a dedicated corporate account team, distributors including Ingram Micro
and TechData, and leading value-added resellers. We have strategic relationships
with companies such as Acer, IBM, NEC, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, bmi
british midland, Lan Chile Airlines, Boeing, Buy.com, Amazon.com and Hilton
HHonors Worldwide.

     Our business combines the following key elements:

     - our proprietary product, supplier and compatibility databases;

     - our use of search technology to simplify the ordering process;

     - our capability to rapidly ship business-critical orders;

     - our focus on a high repeat purchase and replacement market;

     - our strategic referral relationships with key notebook computer OEMs
       (original equipment manufacturers) including IBM, NEC and Acer;

     - our strategic relationships with major airlines including United
       Airlines, Delta Air Lines, bmi british midland and Lan Chile Airlines;

     - our relationships with national resellers and distributors including
       Ingram Micro and Tech Data;

     - our ability to offer customized solutions for corporate customers; and

     - our ability to serve corporate America through a growing network of
       distributors and value added resellers.

     As a result of these factors, we have established a leading position in the
mobile accessory market. Our customer database includes profiles of over 851,000
mobile users and detailed transaction histories on over 351,000 buyers. In
January 2000, iGo completed the acquisitions of AR Industries, Inc., d.b.a. Road
Warrior International, and CAW Products, Inc., d.b.a. Cellular Accessory
Warehouse, in unrelated transactions. Road Warrior was a designer and
distributor of notebook computer power and mobile connectivity products, as well
as model-specific notebook computer hard drive upgrades. Cellular Accessory
Warehouse was a distributor of model-specific cellular accessories. In August
2000, iGo completed the acquisition of Xtend Micro Products, Inc., a leader in
power products and accessories for the portable computer market. In 2001, we
continued to expand and grow our channel focus with the Road Warrior and Xtend
product lines and have expanded both lines to include additional proprietary
products. Product lines in the CAW business were transitioned under the Road
Warrior lines as our focus is now dedicated to the Xtend and Road Warrior
product lines.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

  PORTABLE COMPUTING AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS MARKETPLACE

     The use of notebook computers and mobile communications devices has grown
rapidly due to infrastructure and hardware improvements which have simplified
use, increased portability and reduced equipment and cellular airtime cost.
According to Gartner Dataquest, there were 25.5 million portable personal
computers, or PCs, shipped worldwide in 2000 and an estimated 38.2 million will
ship in 2003, a 50% increase. The Cellular Telephone and Internet Association
estimates that as of June 2001 there were 118 million wireless subscribers in
the United States. Another study from Gartner Dataquest revealed that global PDA
shipments in 2001 increased 18% to 13.1 million units from 2000's 11.1 million.
Statistics such as these reveal the continued opportunity to supply mobile
computing accessories for notebook computers, cell phones and PDAs.

     Busy professionals and other time-constrained people are increasingly
incorporating mobile electronic devices into their daily lives. The more these
individuals utilize the functionality of their mobile electronic devices, the
more dependent they become on these devices to maintain their lifestyles and
work patterns. As the number and utilization of these devices increases, the
demand for consistent and reliable accessories, batteries and other supporting
products will increase.

  INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE OPPORTUNITIES

     The Internet is now an accepted global communications medium, enabling
millions of users to obtain and share information, interact with each other and
conduct business electronically. International Data Corporation, or IDC,
estimates that the number of Internet users worldwide will reach 941 million by
2005. The increasing adoption of the Internet as an important communications
tool provides businesses and consumers with an effective vehicle to access
product information, services and online customer support. According to the
United States Census, total online sales for 2001 were approximately $32.6
billion, an increase of 19.3% from 2000. This growth rate was sharper than the
growth for overall retail sales in the same period.

     Businesses with mobile workforces and individual business travelers are not
well served by traditional channels, which include mobile device manufacturers,
traditional retailers and mail-order companies. There is a significant market
opportunity to meet the needs of this large and underserved marketplace. This
opportunity stems from the capabilities created by the nature of the products
and the limitations of the traditional buying process:

     - The Products' Complexity.  Most accessories and batteries for notebook
       computers, cellular phones and handheld electronic devices are brand and
       model-specific, creating a complex set of product/accessory combinations
       that will continue to proliferate as new device models are introduced. In
       addition, these products are peripheral and are often overlooked by
       manufacturers and retailers in the industry, who typically focus on the
       newest hardware models.

     - Limited Availability of Accessories.  Notebook computers, cellular phones
       and other handheld electronic devices are manufactured and distributed by
       many companies yet there is no one complete source for model-specific
       accessories in this fragmented marketplace. As the installed base of
       mobile electronic devices continues to grow, it becomes increasingly
       difficult to maintain the comprehensive selection of accessories
       essential to meet the purchasing needs of individuals and businesses.

     - Lack of Customer Service Capabilities.  Businesses and consumers are
       interested in obtaining the right accessories and batteries for their
       mobile electronic devices quickly and easily. However, most mobile device
       manufacturers and traditional retailers are focused primarily on selling
       the newest devices and are not adequately staffed or trained to handle
       the wide array of product availability and compatibility questions.
       Accordingly, they are typically unable to adequately serve their
       customers' accessory needs, which include model-specific batteries,
       adapters and chargers.

     We believe that we offer a solution that addresses these limitations and
combines a broad product selection, convenient access, rapid delivery and
excellent customer service for mobile device accessories.

THE IGO SOLUTION

     iGo's mission is to help keep the mobile professional powered-up and
connected. We strive to be the most customer-centric mobile accessory company by
making our products available through channels that are important to our
customers and partners. The iGo solution is available toll-free, online, and
through a dedicated corporate account team and hundreds of reseller locations
nationwide. We enable businesses and individual consumers to efficiently
identify, locate and purchase model-specific accessories for mobile electronic
devices. Our proprietary relational databases combined with our comprehensive
industry knowledge and service expertise create a valuable one-stop solution for
our customers and partners who require accessories for cell phones, notebook
computers and PDAs. We believe that our business model offers a comprehensive
solution with significant benefits to mobile device manufacturers, business
enterprises, mobile professionals and individuals on the go.

     Key elements of the iGo solution include:

     - Broad Selection of Mobile Accessories.  We offer a broad selection of
       accessories for portable computing and mobile communications devices
       compatible with the majority of brands and models of mobile devices sold.

     - Proprietary Relational Product Database.  We have developed a proprietary
       relational database architecture that enables our customers to accurately
       match their mobile accessories to compatible device brands and models.
       Our databases contain thousands of part numbers and individual items,
       images and detailed product descriptions. Our supplier database includes
       information for hundreds of trusted suppliers around the world. Our
       databases were assembled from primary research conducted over nine years
       and would be difficult to replicate, especially in the case of older
       models because mobile device manufacturers often do not maintain detailed
       information on older products.

     - Proprietary Products.  Over the past two years, principally through
       acquisitions, we have evolved from largely being a reseller of other
       companies' products to also having our own line of core accessories.
       These core accessories include: batteries, AC adapters, auto/in-flight
       power cords and international connectivity products for mobile devices.
       iGo develops its own line of mobile accessories under the Xtend and Road
       Warrior brands.

     - Authoritative Source for Mobile Product Information.  We provide our
       customers with solutions by answering important technical support
       questions and making purchase recommendations for mobile devices and
       accessories. Our industry knowledge enables us to better serve our
       customers. Our quality customer service encourages repeat purchases and
       word-of-mouth referrals. Our online support enables customers to
       efficiently find solutions to their problems in the field.

     - Multi-Channel Presence.  Consumers, resellers and businesses use iGo to
       simplify the process of purchasing accessories for their mobile devices.
       We understand that while some companies prefer to buy direct through our
       traditional toll-free, online or corporate sales team channels, others
       choose to purchase indirectly through Value Added Resellers (VARs).
       Accordingly, we have created a strong presence with leading distributors
       nationwide, including Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and have developed
       strategic relationships with VARs such as CompuCom, CDW and Insight so
       our corporate customers with a procurement source already in place can
       also purchase iGo products through their approved vendors. We have
       enabled enterprises such as Merck, State Farm, Johnson and Johnson,
       Siemens and Pfizer to efficiently support their mobile workforces and
       protect their investment in expensive mobile computing and communications
       devices by providing batteries and accessories that keep these devices
       running.

     - Customer Database.  Our direct marketing experience has allowed us to
       develop an effective customer acquisition and retention model. Since our
       inception in 1993, we have assembled detailed profiles of over 851,000
       mobile users. In addition, this database contains detailed transaction
       histories on over 351,000 of our customers, including the brands and
       models of the user's portable devices along with the original advertising
       lead source that prompted the user to contact us. The knowledge derived
       from these detailed transaction histories enables us to better recommend
       model-specific and customer-

       specific accessories. The model-specific accessory relationship also
       provides us with built-in customer personalization. Once we know the
       customer's model, we can automatically recommend a host of accessories
       specially designed for their notebook computer, cell-phone or PDA. In
       addition, rechargeable batteries wear out over time as the heat and
       stress of repetitive charge and discharge cycles degrade the chemical
       components of the cells. By leveraging our direct marketing expertise
       combined with our product lifecycle knowledge, we can develop effective
       customer repurchase strategies.

THE IGO WEBSITE

     Our website homepage, robust search engine, product descriptions and value
added tips and advice were crafted with the mobile professional in mind. Our
site's search functionality allows customers to search for batteries, adapters
and chargers using their device's manufacturer name, product category and/or
model number. It also facilitates cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. Our
"Tips and Advice" section answers frequently-asked questions, makes purchase
recommendations and offers advice on how to get the most productive use out of
batteries and other accessories. We also offer real-time text chat with our
customer solutions representatives for our online customers who need technical
support or purchase advice. The overall customer experience is designed to
provide expertise and responsiveness to customers who are often frustrated by
the traditional means of inquiring about and purchasing mobile electronic
devices and accessories.

PRODUCT OFFERINGS

     We focus on providing quality accessories for mobile users. Prices
typically range from $29 to $199. We offer an extensive selection of product
categories, including:

     - Notebook Computer Accessories.  We offer a broad selection of
       model-specific notebook computer accessories including batteries, AC
       chargers, auto/in-flight power cords, hard drive upgrades, external
       storage media, modems and port replicators.

     - Cellular Phone Accessories.  Our selection of cellular gear includes
       batteries, hands-free devices, AC chargers, car power cords, and
       protective cases.

     - Handheld Electronic Device Accessories.  Our selection of model-specific
       accessories for PDAs includes stylus tools, charging/synchronizing cables
       and protective cases.

     - Travel Products and Mobile Services.  We offer a complete line of
       international phone and power adapters so our customers can power up and
       connect with their mobile technology products and accessories anywhere in
       the world. Our Road Warrior International Survival Guide is an on-line
       travel portal containing comprehensive content for the business traveler
       for over 160 countries around the world. Using the Guide, customers can
       locate the adapters required in each country, convert currency, learn
       about the culture and even research the languages spoken in a specific
       region.

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS

     We intend to continue to establish and leverage strategic relationships
with mobile device manufacturers, suppliers and domestic and international
airlines.

     International Airlines.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, we launched our
first international relationships to sell our in-flight power adapters to two of
the world's leading airlines: bmi british midland, the second largest airline
serving the United Kingdom and Lan Chile Airlines, the largest airline in Chile
and a leading airline in Latin America.

     Domestic Airlines.  Our relationships with Delta Air Lines and United
Airlines enable us to market products through in-flight, online and other
customer referral programs.

     Membership Reward Programs.  In September 2001, we entered into a
relationship with Quixtar, Inc., Amway's online business unit. We offer
essential mobile computing and communication accessories to hundreds of
thousands of Independent Business Owners (IBOs) affiliated with Quixtar. Another
one of our membership reward partners is the Hilton HHonors program, one of the
world's leading guest reward

programs. iGo successfully launched the Hilton HHonors International Travel
Guide, a program that enables Hilton HHonor members to earn and redeem HHonors
points for mobile computing merchandise promoted through a co-branded
international content and e-commerce travel portal (www.igohilton.com).

     Original Equipment Manufacturers.  We have relationships with Acer, NEC and
IBM. Through these relationships we obtain referrals and fulfill accessory
orders. We also have access to these companies' complete product lines. This is
just one more method that iGo uses to offer our customers a variety of solutions
to ensure productivity wherever they go.

     Our strategic relationships are often not subject to formal agreements
and/or can be terminated on little or no advance notice. The terms of our
agreements with Acer, NEC and IBM require us to purchase minimum amounts of
product each year. If we fail to meet these purchase levels, those parties have
the discretion to terminate our agreements with them. We have not met such
purchase levels to date, but have received no indication from any of those
parties that they intend to terminate our relationship. Also, in each case
either party may terminate the agreement with or without cause on two to three
months' written notice. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that these
relationships will continue on their current terms or at all.

MARKETING AND CUSTOMER ACQUISITION

     We employ a combination of traditional and online marketing programs to
acquire customers, retain existing customers and build brand awareness.
Additionally, our new channel focus with our proprietary Road Warrior and Xtend
product lines has opened new opportunities to create marketing programs that
focus on the distribution channel. All of our programs are designed to
cost-effectively acquire and retain high-value resellers, corporate purchasing
agents and mobile users.

     Channel Marketing Activities.  In order to leverage the benefit of the
large direct sales forces employed by our two key distribution partners, Ingram
Micro and Tech Data, together with large resellers, we routinely participate in
joint marketing opportunities. These include sponsoring sales force training,
participating in their direct marketing catalogs and promotions.

     Cellular Retailer and Service Carriers.  To reach the cellular accessory
sales market, we have developed reseller relationships with specialty, regional
and mass retail stores. These retailers allow us to effectively reach consumers
interested in cellular accessories.

     Offline Marketing and Promotion.  To support our channels, we have
developed marketing materials such as specification sheets and product catalogs.
This type of documentation provides VARs, retailers and distributors with
pertinent product information needed to effectively sell our products to their
customer base. We have also utilized telemarketing and postcard mailings for
customer acquisition and retention.

     Online Marketing and Promotion.  Our online marketing and promotion
strategy is designed to drive prospects to our website, acquire new customers
and encourage repeat purchasing behavior. Through our advertising and
promotions, we target purchasing agents, mobile professionals and other people
who are themselves purchasers or who influence the purchase of mobile products
and accessories at work. Our banners and promotions are designed to identify
with the unique needs of these people, as well as provide solutions to their
portable computing and mobile communications accessory needs.

     We use pay-for-performance affiliate and advertising opportunities, search
engine optimization and referral relationship deals as the principal on-line
mechanisms to acquire new customers. We pay our registered affiliates and
partners a referral fee in the range of 7% to 15% of the net revenue generated
from the initial customer order received from the link to our website. We use
email campaigns as our principal on-line customer retention vehicle. For email
customer retention and repurchase efforts, we analyze buyer behavior to optimize
response.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

     As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had accounts receivable from a major
customer, Ingram Micro Inc., of approximately $1.4 million and $1.9 million,
respectively. Sales to this customer totaled approximately

$3.6 million and $5.0 million in the years 2001 and 2000, respectively. No other
customer represented a significant percentage of our accounts receivable or
sales in the years 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 1999, and for the year then
ended, there were no customers that represented a significant percentage of our
sales or accounts receivable. Concentrations with respect to trade receivables
are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their geographic
and economic dispersion. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
credit risks consist primarily of cash accounts on deposit with banks, which, at
times, may exceed federally insured limits. We believe we are not exposed to any
significant credit risk related to cash or accounts receivable.

ENTERPRISE SALES

     Our enterprise sales team targets large-to-medium size businesses,
resellers, government agencies and educational institutions in an effort to
generate large orders and develop continuing customer relationships. In
particular, our enterprise sales representatives target enterprises with large
field sales forces or large installed bases of notebook computers or cell
phones.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

     Our goal is to provide our customers with the highest level of customer
support. We offer customer service 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.
Representatives handle contacts with customers through telephone, fax, email and
live text chat. Our support services include product inquiries, ordering,
technical support and customer service issues. We provide a high level of
support by utilizing our sophisticated product and compatibility databases and
by training our representatives with the in-depth knowledge required to meet the
needs of resellers, corporate purchasing agents and mobile users. We have
retained a third-party call center to handle after hours, overflow and possible
disaster conditions.

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS

     We have developed a scalable, secure and reliable technology infrastructure
to support our website and customer contact center, as well as to maintain and
integrate our proprietary databases, our supply chain, and our accounting,
finance and management reporting functions. Our website is designed to be
accessible from all standard browsers without the need for additional client
software. Our systems are designed to capture large amounts of customer-specific
data, which is important to our ability to provide post-sale service and to
target customers for future purchases. We also incorporate a variety of
encryption and fraud detection technologies designed to protect the privacy of
customer information and the integrity of customer transactions.

     Our software system architecture uses industry standard technologies to
maximize reliability and scalability. We use Secure Socket Layer for secure
transactions. Our applications run on an array of Intel-based server systems
utilizing Microsoft Windows NT and SQL Server. We can scale our service as
traffic increases by installing additional servers or increasing the number of
processors per server. Our production data and hosting center is located at
Advanced Telecom Group in Reno, Nevada, which provides routing and high
bandwidth communication lines to a variety of major Internet backbone providers,
as well as 24 hour-per-day monitoring and support. Our production data center
also includes multiple redundant backup systems and power generators. We
maintain server and bandwidth overcapacity at our hosting center to accommodate
traffic spikes or server failure.

     We believe that our technology platform provides sophisticated electronic
commerce functionality and integration, employing the following key systems:

     - relational databases;

     - customer relationship management software;

     - real-time Internet customer service;

     - automated call distribution; and

     - the Microsoft Commerce Server 2000 electronic commerce platform.

     We currently manage our own fulfillment center where we receive, pick, pack
and ship our products.

COMPETITION

     The mobile computing and communication markets in which we operate are
rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive
factors in our marketplace are product selection, price and customer service.
Our competitors operate in a number of different distribution channels,
including electronic commerce, traditional retailing, catalog retailing and
direct selling. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies
in the sale of products in specific categories, including:

     - mobile products suppliers such as Targus;

     - retailers and etailers such as CompUSA and Amazon.com;

     - direct marketers such as Buy.com, CDW, Insight and Microwarehouse; and

     - traditional mobile device manufacturers or OEMs such as Fujitsu, Toshiba,
       IBM, NEC, Acer, Gateway, Dell, Nokia, Motorola and Erickson.

     Our competitors may have the ability to devote substantially more resources
to the development, marketing, and/or sale of mobile device accessories than we
do. In addition, larger and more well-financed entities may acquire, invest in
or form joint ventures with our competitors. Some of our competitors may be able
to secure products from suppliers on more favorable terms, fulfill customer
orders more efficiently and adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory
availability policies then we can. Finally, new technologies and the expansion
of existing technologies, such as price comparison programs that search for
products from a variety of websites, may direct customers to other online
merchants. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     We regard our brand and substantial elements of our website and relational
databases as proprietary, and seek their protection through trademark, service
mark, copyright and trade secret laws. We enter into non-disclosure agreements
with our employees and consultants, and generally with strategic partners.
Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization.

     Our iGo brand and our Internet address, www.iGo.com, are important
components of our business strategy. We have obtained federal trademark
registrations for our iGo, iGo (stylized), Xtend, 1-800-Batteries, Road Warrior,
iGo.com and PowerXtender trademarks. Mobile Technology Outfitter and Pocket Dock
are trademarks of iGo or its subsidiaries.

     We also rely to a material extent on technology developed and licensed from
third parties. These licenses may not continue to be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms in the future. The loss of existing technology
licenses could harm the performance of our existing services until equivalent
technology can be identified, obtained and integrated. Failure to obtain new
technology licenses may result in delays or reductions in the introduction of
new features, functions or services, which would harm our business. We have been
notified from time to time that certain products that we offer may infringe on
the proprietary rights of others. We take these notifications very seriously and
handle them appropriately. There can be no assurances that third parties will
not claim infringement in the future. We expect that the continued growth of the
Internet will result in an increasing number of infringement claims as legal
standards related to our market continue to evolve. Any such claim, with or
without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, and may
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

     We have also registered our iGo and Road Warrior trademarks in certain
foreign countries in which we currently conduct, or intend to conduct
significant business. It is often difficult to obtain clear, registered title to
trademarks in foreign countries. We have encountered certain conflicts in
connection with these foreign trademark applications, and there is no guarantee
that we will be able to secure registrations in any particular

foreign country. In addition, we may be prohibited from using one or more of our
marks in certain foreign countries.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible
that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the
Internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing,
content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising,
intellectual property rights and information security. The nature of this
legislation and the manner in which it may be interpreted and enforced cannot be
fully determined and, therefore, this legislation could subject us to potential
liability, which in turn could harm our business. The adoption of any such laws
or regulations might also decrease the rate of growth of Internet use, which in
turn could decrease the demand for our products and services, or increase the
cost of doing business, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, applicability to the Internet of existing
laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other
intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is
uncertain. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of
the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or
address the unique issues of electronic commerce.

     Several states have also proposed legislation that would limit the use of
personal information gathered online or require websites to establish privacy
policies. The Federal Trade Commission has also initiated action against at
least one website regarding the manner in which information is collected from
users and provided to third parties. Changes to existing laws or the passage of
new laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed
changes, could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand
for our products or services, increase the cost of doing business as a result of
litigation costs or increase service delivery costs. In addition, because our
products and services are accessible throughout the United States, other
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation in a particular state. We are qualified to do business in
Nevada. Our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where
we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties for the failure
to qualify and could result in our inability to enforce contracts in those
jurisdictions. Any new legislation or regulation of this kind, or the
application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not
currently apply to our business, could harm our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

     As of March 1, 2002, we had 107 full-time employees, including 8 employees
based in the Xtend Micro division, 18 in our customer contact center, 44 in
sales and marketing, 28 in technology and operations, and 5 in executive
management and administration. We devote, and will continue to devote,
substantial resources to attract high-quality employees and build a strong
corporate culture that encourages and rewards success. We believe that our
investments in recruiting and training help us attract and retain key managers
and productive employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor
union; we have never experienced a work stoppage; and we consider our employee
relations to be good.

                               PROPERTIES OF IGO

     Our corporate offices are located in Reno, Nevada. We rent approximately
85,000 square feet under a fourteen-year lease that expires in December 2013. In
March 2002, we negotiated an amendment to this lease, which requires sixty days
notice of termination by us and ninety days notice of termination by the
landlord. We anticipate relocating operations to a smaller facility more
suitable to our current operations during 2002. Additionally, one of our
subsidiaries has a 2,300 square foot facility in Irvine, California under a
lease that expires in May 2003.

                            LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF IGO

     From time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct
of our business. We are not currently a party to any lawsuit or arbitration
proceeding the outcome of which we believe will have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission has entered a formal order of
private investigation concerning the events underlying our revisions of our
fiscal 2000 operating results based on adjustments to fourth quarter 2000
revenue, which results were announced and revised in certain press releases
issued in January and March of 2001. In connection with its investigation, the
Commission will also be reviewing the restatement of our financial statements
set forth in our 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any amendment thereto, and
certain related accounting, sales and organizational matters. We have been
cooperating fully with the Staff of the Commission in its investigation and to
date the Staff has made no determinations that we are aware of with respect to
this investigation.

     Cost of goods sold and gross profit were adversely impacted in 2001 by
additional inventory write-downs related to the transition of our product
strategy toward higher margin accessory products, as well as normal write-downs
for excess or obsolete product inventory. The additional write-downs related to
the transition of our product strategy amounted to approximately $3.3 million.
In addition, we recorded a write-down of goodwill of approximately $9.5 million
during the fourth quarter of 2001, which is included in merger and acquisition
costs.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF IGO

OVERVIEW

     iGo was incorporated in March 1993 and began offering products for sale
later that year, but did not generate meaningful revenues until 1995. For the
period from inception to 1995, our operating activities related primarily to the
development of our proprietary databases and to locating favorable sources of
supply. In 1995, we launched our first direct marketing campaign and focused on
building sales volume and fulfillment capabilities, and in 1996, we launched our
website. Since 1997, we have significantly increased the depth of our management
team to help implement our growth strategy. In June 1997, we relocated from San
Jose, California to Reno, Nevada to take advantage of lower operating costs for
our customer contact and fulfillment centers.

     Product revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of a sale
arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, title has passed, sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Product revenue
is recorded net of any discounts and reserves for expected returns. The majority
of orders are shipped the same day they are received. Wireless data service
activation fees are recognized at the time of activation of the service. During
2001, approximately 83% of customer purchase transactions were made with credit
cards. We generally receive payment from the credit card companies within one to
four business days after shipment of the product. We also extend credit terms,
typically net 30 days to 90 days, to corporate accounts that we have evaluated
for credi
