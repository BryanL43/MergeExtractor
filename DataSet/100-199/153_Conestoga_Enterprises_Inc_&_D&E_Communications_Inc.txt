                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     The boards of directors of D&E Communications, Inc. and Conestoga
Enterprises, Inc. have approved a merger agreement under which D&E
Communications will acquire Conestoga. We are convinced that this transaction
will enable us to advance our strategic goals and enhance our market position as
a regional integrated communications services provider more quickly than either
D&E Communications or Conestoga could have on its own.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Conestoga shareholders will have
the opportunity to elect to receive in the merger, for each share of Conestoga
common stock that he or she owns, either: cash, shares of D&E Communications
common stock, or a combination of cash and D&E Communications common stock,
intended, in each case, to have a value of $33.00 per Conestoga share. As we
more fully explain beginning on page 3 in the "Summary" and elsewhere in this
document, Conestoga shareholders may receive merger consideration with a per
share value of more or less than $33.00 and may receive more or less cash or
stock than they elect.

     We have each scheduled a special meeting of our shareholders to vote on the
merger proposal. Conestoga will hold a special meeting of its shareholders to
vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. D&E Communications
will hold a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the issuance of up to
9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications common stock in connection with the
merger.

     YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend your
shareholders' meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and mailing
the enclosed proxy card in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card.
We cannot complete the merger unless the Conestoga shareholders approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the D&E Communications shareholders approve the
issuance of the D&E Communications common stock in connection with the merger.

     The dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

   FOR D&E COMMUNICATIONS, INC. SHAREHOLDERS:         FOR CONESTOGA ENTERPRISES, INC. SHAREHOLDERS:

Q:  WHAT WILL I BE VOTING ON AT THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING?

A:  If you are a Conestoga shareholder, you will be voting on a merger
    transaction in which D&E Communications will acquire Conestoga. If you are a
    D&E Communications shareholder, you will be voting on a proposal to issue
    shares of D&E Communications common stock to Conestoga shareholders in the
    merger transaction.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A:  In the merger, a subsidiary of D&E Communications will merge with Conestoga
    and the resulting company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of D&E
    Communications.

    place at                , Eastern Standard Time, on                at
                   .

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  We expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible once all the
    conditions to the merger, including obtaining the approvals of our
    shareholders at the special meetings, are fulfilled. Fulfilling some of
    these conditions, such as receiving certain governmental clearances or
    approvals, is not entirely within our control. We currently expect to
    complete the merger in the second quarter of 2002.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
    joint proxy statement/prospectus, please complete and sign the Conestoga or
    D&E Communications proxy card, as the case may be, and return it in the
    enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be
    represented at the special meeting of Conestoga shareholders or the special
    meeting of D&E Communications shareholders, as the case may be.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A:  You should contact your broker. Your broker will vote your shares only if
    you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions
    provided by your broker to vote your shares.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY PROXY?

A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
    special meeting of Conestoga shareholders or the special meeting of D&E
    Communications shareholders, as the case may be. You can do this in one of
    three ways:

     1) send a written notice to the corporate secretary stating that you would
        like to revoke your proxy;

     2) complete and submit to the corporate secretary a new proxy with a later
        date; or

     3) attend the special meeting of Conestoga shareholders or the special
        meeting of D&E Communications shareholders, as the case may be, and vote
        in person. Simply attending the meeting, however, will not cause your
        vote to be changed unless you vote at the meeting.

    If you choose option 1) or 2) you must submit the notice of revocation or
    the new proxy to Conestoga or D&E Communications, as the case may be, at the
    applicable address on page 2. If you have instructed a broker to vote your
    shares, you must follow directions received from your broker to change your
    vote.

    your election and, in some circumstances, on the elections made by other
    Conestoga shareholders.

    instructions printed on the form. Promptly after we close the merger, D&E
    Communications will issue a press release and send notice to Conestoga
    shareholders regarding the exchange ratio and the election deadline relating
    to the form of merger consideration to be received by Conestoga
    shareholders. The form, together with the stock certificates representing
    your shares of Conestoga common stock, should be sent to the exchange agent,
    [EXCHANGE AGENT], before the election deadline, which is ten days after the
    effective time of the merger.

Q:  SHOULD SHAREHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR PROXY CARD?

A:  No. Conestoga shareholders should submit their proxy cards and stock
    certificates separately. Conestoga shareholders should mail their stock
    certificates along with their election form to the exchange agent, [EXCHANGE

THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 27 THROUGH 53)

THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS DOCUMENT. PLEASE CAREFULLY
READ THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS THE LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT
GOVERNS THE MERGER.

What Conestoga Shareholders will Receive in the Merger (See pages 55 through 56)

     Conestoga shareholders will receive for their shares of Conestoga common
stock

     - $33 in cash, or

     - a number of shares of D&E Communications common stock (the exchange
       ratio) designed to provide Conestoga shareholders with D&E Communications
       shares having a value of $33, subject to adjustment as noted below, or

     - a combination of cash and D&E Communications common stock determined by
       reference to the exchange ratio

depending on the election made by them and by other Conestoga shareholders, as
well as the application of proration provisions, described below.

     We will determine the exact exchange ratio by dividing $33.00 by the volume
weighted average of sales prices for a share of D&E Communications common stock
as reported on the Nasdaq National Market System over the twenty trading days,
during which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurred, immediately
preceding the second business day before we complete the merger. The exchange
ratio, however, will be fixed at 1.4348 if the volume weighted average per share
sales price of D&E Communications shares over this period is equal to or greater
than $23.00, and at 2.5385 if the volume weighted average per share sales price
over this period is equal to or less than $13.00.

     If a Conestoga shareholder elects to receive some or all D&E Communications
shares (or, if due to the proration provisions described below, a Conestoga
shareholder will receive some D&E Communications shares despite an election to
receive 100% cash), the number of D&E Communications shares he or she will
receive for each Conestoga share to be so converted will not be less than
1.4348, nor more than 2.5385, regardless of what happens to D&E Communications'
share price. This also means that if the volume weighted average sales price of
D&E Communications shares is less than $13.00, or more than $23.00, the D&E
Communications shares that Conestoga shareholders will receive for each
Conestoga share to be so converted will likely have a value at the time we
complete the merger of less than, or more than, $33.00.

     Promptly after the merger occurs, D&E Communications will issue a press
release and send a notice to Conestoga shareholders announcing the exchange
ratio, the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications
shares over the applicable 20-day trading period and the deadline for Conestoga
shareholders to submit their elections regarding the form of merger
consideration they wish to receive.

     In certain circumstances described elsewhere in this document (see pages 54
through 56), the election of Conestoga shareholders regarding the merger
consideration may be adjusted to ensure that no more than 55% of the number of
shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding immediately before the merger are
converted into cash consideration in the merger and that no more than 9,467,068
shares of D&E Communications common stock are issued in the merger. D&E
Communications will not issue any fractional shares to Conestoga shareholders.
Instead, such shareholders will receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of
D&E Communications common stock.

     You should refer to "The Merger Agreement -- Merger Consideration Analysis"
on page 57, for details regarding the impact of various potential volume

weighted average per share prices of D&E Communications common stock within a
range of $5.00 to $31.00 on the exchange ratio, the amount of stock and cash
consideration to be received by Conestoga shareholders and the expected
ownership of the combined company by Conestoga shareholders and D&E
Communications shareholders.

     Election of Cash and/or Stock Consideration (See pages 54 through
56).  Conestoga shareholders will receive an election form along with this
document. Conestoga shareholders should use this form to elect to receive cash,
D&E Communications common stock or a combination of cash and D&E Communications
common stock in exchange for their shares of Conestoga common stock. The
election form contains instructions on how to surrender Conestoga common stock
certificates to the exchange agent, [EXCHANGE AGENT], in exchange for cash
and/or D&E Communications common stock.

Conestoga Stock Options (See page 60)

     When we complete the merger, stock options to purchase Conestoga common
shares granted to Conestoga employees under Conestoga's stock option plans will
become options to purchase D&E Communications common shares. The number of
common shares subject to such stock options and the exercise price of such stock
options will be adjusted according to the exchange ratio.

Our Recommendations to Shareholders (See pages 33 through 37)

     Conestoga Shareholders.  The board of directors of Conestoga believes that
the merger is fair to and in the best interests of Conestoga and its
shareholders and unanimously recommends that Conestoga shareholders vote "FOR"
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

     D&E Communications Shareholders.  The D&E Communications board of directors
believes that the merger is fair to and in the best interests of D&E
Communications and its shareholders, and it recommends that you vote "FOR" the
proposal to issue D&E Communications common shares in the merger.

Opinion of Conestoga's Financial Advisor (See pages 37 through 39)

     In deciding to approve the merger agreement, the board of directors of
Conestoga considered the opinion of Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated dated
November 19, 2001 regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be received by the shareholders of Conestoga under the merger
agreement. The opinion contains important qualifications and a description of
assumptions made, matters considered, areas of reliance on others and
limitations on the review undertaken by Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated. We
have attached this opinion, dated November 19, 2001, as Annex B to this
document. THE OPINION OF LEGG MASON WOOD WALKER, INCORPORATED IS NOT A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSED
MERGER AGREEMENT. CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD READ THE LEGG MASON WOOD WALKER,
INCORPORATED OPINION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED,
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN.

Opinion of D&E Communications' Financial Advisor (See pages 40 through 44)

     In deciding to approve the merger agreement, the board of directors of D&E
Communications received and considered the opinion of Jefferies & Company, Inc.
as to the fairness to D&E Communications, from a financial point of view, of the
merger. The opinion contains important qualifications and a description of
assumptions made, matters considered, areas of reliance on others and
limitations on the review undertaken by Jefferies & Company, Inc. We have
attached this opinion, dated November 21, 2001, as Annex C to this document. THE
OPINION OF JEFFERIES & COMPANY, INC. IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY D&E
COMMUNICATIONS SHAREHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE MERGER. D&E
COMMUNICATIONS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD READ THE JEFFERIES & COMPANY, INC. OPINION
CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS
CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See pages 67 through 68)

     The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction of numerous
conditions, each of which may be waived. In addition to customary conditions

relating to our respective compliance with the merger agreement and other
customary conditions described elsewhere in this document, the following
material conditions must also be satisfied:

     - receipt of all requisite material governmental approvals, including:

       - consent by the Federal Communications Commission required under the
         Communications Act of 1934 to the transfer of control of Conestoga and
         its FCC licenses and authorizations;

       - the expiration or early termination by the Department of Justice or
         Federal Trade Commission of the waiting period under the
         Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; and

       - approval by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of the merger
         and the transfer of control of Conestoga's telephone operations;

     - approval of the merger agreement by Conestoga shareholders and approval
       of the common share issuance by D&E Communications shareholders; and

     - if at least 40% of the aggregate consideration to be received by
       Conestoga shareholders in connection with the merger is comprised of D&E
       Communications common stock, receipt by Conestoga of an opinion from
       special counsel to D&E Communications that among other things, for U.S.
       federal income tax purposes, the merger will be a reorganization within
       the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Neither D&E Communications nor Conestoga intend to waive the above material
conditions without resoliciting shareholders for approval of the merger under
such circumstances.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See pages 68 through 69)

     The merger agreement contains fairly typical termination provisions for a
transaction of this type that may apply even if Conestoga shareholders have
approved the merger and D&E Communications shareholders have approved the share
issuance. In addition, either of us can decide, without the consent of the
other, to terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by
August 31, 2002.

     Conestoga may, without the consent of D&E Communications, terminate the
merger agreement:

     - if the Conestoga board of directors withdraws, materially modifies or
       changes its recommendation of the merger agreement or merger and there
       exists at the time of such withdrawal, modification or change a proposal
       or offer for a competing business combination between Conestoga and a
       third party that is financially superior to the merger, D&E
       Communications fails to make an adequate counter proposal and Conestoga
       pays the termination fee; or

     - if the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E
       Communications common stock for any 10 consecutive trading days during
       which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs is less than
       $8.00, but only within two business days following the 10 day period.

     D&E Communications may, without the consent of Conestoga, terminate the
merger agreement if the Conestoga board of directors withdraws, materially
modifies or amends its recommendation of the merger agreement or merger.

Termination Fees (See page 69)

     If the merger agreement terminates, Conestoga may have to pay D&E
Communications a termination fee of $10 million under circumstances described
elsewhere in this document. In addition, if the merger agreement terminates as a
result of the Conestoga shareholders failing to approve the merger after receipt
of a superior proposal from a third party or as a result of D&E Communications
common stock trading below $8.00 for a specified time frame, Conestoga must
reimburse D&E Communications for D&E Communications' documented expenses
incurred in connection with the merger. If the merger agreement terminates as a
result of a superior proposal and Conestoga enters into a definitive merger
agreement with any acquiror within nine months after termination of the merger
agreement, or approves or recommends any other transaction, Conestoga must pay
D&E Communications the $10 million termination fee less any reimbursed expenses.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGES 47 THROUGH 52)

Structure of the Merger (See pages 47 through 52)

     If, on the effective date of the merger, the fair market value of the D&E
Communications common stock delivered to Conestoga shareholders in the merger is
greater than or equal to 40% of the total consideration delivered to Conestoga
shareholders in the merger (including any cash paid by Conestoga to redeem
shares of Conestoga's series A preferred stock), then the merger will be a
forward merger of Conestoga with and into D&E Acquisition Corp. qualified as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If, on the
effective date of the merger, the fair market value of the D&E Communications
common stock delivered to Conestoga shareholders in the merger is less than 40%
of the total consideration delivered to Conestoga shareholders in the merger,
then the merger will automatically be a reverse merger of D&E Acquisition Corp.
with and into Conestoga and will be treated as a fully taxable sale by Conestoga
shareholders of their shares of Conestoga common stock.

     The tax consequences resulting from the merger will differ depending on
whether the forward merger structure or the reverse merger structure is used.
Assuming all outstanding shares of Conestoga preferred stock are converted into
Conestoga common stock as described elsewhere in this document (see page 53),
the forward merger structure will be used if the closing price of D&E
Communications common stock on the trading day preceding the closing date is at
least approximately $10.60 (assuming (1) 8,287,669 shares of Conestoga common
stock are outstanding, (2) all outstanding shares of Conestoga preferred stock
have converted into common stock, (3) 55% of Conestoga shares of common stock
are to be converted into cash consideration and 45% of such shares are to be
converted into D&E Communications common stock and (4) no cash in lieu of
fractional shares is paid), and the reverse merger structure will be used if the
closing price of D&E Communications common stock on such date (based on such
assumptions) is less than approximately $10.60. Since the structure that will be
used to complete the merger will depend on the value of D&E Communications
common stock on the closing date, neither D&E Communications nor Conestoga will
know at the time of the shareholder meeting which structure will be used. As a
result, Conestoga shareholders will not know which of the alternative tax
consequences described below will be applicable to them at the time they vote on
the merger.

     If the forward merger structure is used, the merger will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

     In that case, generally:

     - a Conestoga shareholder who receives solely D&E Communications common
       stock in exchange for shares of Conestoga common stock will not recognize
       any gain or loss, except for any gain or loss attributable to cash
       received in lieu of fractional shares of D&E Communications common stock;

     - a Conestoga shareholder who receives solely cash in exchange for shares
       of Conestoga common stock will be required to recognize gain, and should
       be permitted to recognize loss, equal to the difference between the
       amount of cash received by the shareholder and the shareholder's adjusted
       tax basis in the shares of Conestoga common stock that the shareholder
       surrenders in the merger; and

     - a Conestoga shareholder who receives both D&E Communications common stock
       and cash in exchange for shares of Conestoga common stock will not
       recognize loss, but will recognize gain to the extent of the lesser of:

       - the cash received, including any cash received in lieu of fractional
         shares of D&E Communications common stock; or

       - the excess of the sum of the fair market value of the D&E
         Communications common stock and the amount of cash received over the
         shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Conestoga common
         stock that the shareholder surrenders in the merger.

     Under certain circumstances, gain recognized by a Conestoga shareholder may
be treated as a dividend, and thus as ordinary income, rather than as capital
gain.

     If the reverse merger structure is used, the merger will not qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, but rather
will be treated as a sale of Conestoga stock fully taxable to the Conestoga
shareholders.

     In that case, each Conestoga shareholder will recognize gain or loss equal
to the remainder of:

     - the cash received, including any cash received in lieu of fractional
       shares of D&E Communications common stock, plus the fair market value of
       the D&E Communications common stock received, minus

     - the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Conestoga common
       stock that the shareholder surrenders in the merger.

     The reverse merger structure would be used to avoid the substantial
corporate level tax that would result if the merger were to be structured as a
forward merger and were to fail to satisfy the requirements for a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     For further details, see "The Merger -- Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences" on pages 47 through 52.

     Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to
each Conestoga shareholder will depend on the shareholder's particular facts and
circumstances. Conestoga shareholders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 47)

     As described in greater detail elsewhere in this document, the directors
and executive officers of D&E Communications, and the trustees of the D&E
Communications Voting Trust, have signed voting agreements to vote shares of D&E
Communications capital stock they beneficially own in favor of the merger
proposal, and the directors and certain executive officers of Conestoga have
signed voting agreements to vote their shares of Conestoga common stock in favor
of the merger. Based on the number of shares of D&E Communications common stock
outstanding at the close of business on                , the D&E Communications
voting agreements represent      % of the outstanding number of shares of D&E
Communications common stock. Based on the number of shares of Conestoga common
stock outstanding at the close of business on                , the Conestoga
voting agreements represent      % of the outstanding number of shares of
Conestoga common stock.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 44 THROUGH 46)

     When considering the recommendation of the Conestoga board of directors,
Conestoga shareholders should be aware that some members of Conestoga's
management have interests in the merger that are different from or in addition
to Conestoga shareholders.

     In particular, executive officers of Conestoga are entitled to certain
benefits as a result of the merger. The benefits are payable under Conestoga's
benefit plans and employment agreements between certain executive officers and
Conestoga. Generally, the executive officers of Conestoga will have the right to
elect to accelerate the vesting of outstanding options. The executive officers
will also be entitled to receive payments granted under a bonus pool. In
addition, executive officers with employment agreements will receive substantial
payments under these agreements if their employment is terminated following
completion of the merger.

     D&E Communications has agreed to enter into new employment agreements with
certain Conestoga executive officers following the merger. Under these
employment agreements, the executive officers, who have waived their rights to
benefits under existing employment agreements with Conestoga, will be entitled
to receive certain benefits, including a change of control payment, grants of
D&E Communications stock options and retention bonus payments.

     When considering the recommendation of the D&E Communications board of
directors, D&E Communications shareholders should be aware that some members of
D&E Communications management have interests in the merger that are different
from or in addition to D&E Communications shareholders.

     In particular, D&E Communications maintains a long term incentive plan for
the benefit of certain of its employees. The completion of the merger will
constitute a change of control for purposes of D&E Communications' long term
incentive plan, and some employees of D&E Communications will be deemed to have
earned in full all shares of D&E Communications common stock and all cash
incentive awards granted in accordance with such plan.

NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 53)

     Conestoga shareholders do not have dissenters' rights in connection with
the merger.

                   SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

     The following summary unaudited pro forma financial data as of September
30, 2001 and for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001, and for the
year ended December 31, 2000, combine historical financial information of D&E
Communications and Conestoga to give effect to the merger of D&E Communications
and Conestoga. In addition, the summary unaudited pro forma financial data
contains certain adjustments to give effect to the conversion of Conestoga's
series A preferred stock into Conestoga common stock, the probable sale of
Conestoga's wireless personal communication services business, and the pending
sale of D&E Communications' wireless personal communication services business.
The summary unaudited pro forma data as of September 30, 2001 has been prepared
as if the merger and the other transactions had occurred on that date. The
summary unaudited pro forma data for the nine month period ended September 30,
2001 and for the year ended December 31, 2000 assume that the merger and the
other transactions were consummated on January 1, 2000. Please refer to the
section of this document titled "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed
Financial Statements" for a full description of the pro forma financial data
basis of presentation.

     This summary unaudited pro forma data is presented for illustrative
purposes only. It is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the merger and the other
transactions been completed prior to the dates of presentation, nor is the
information indicative of the future financial position or operating results of
D&E Communications. Results of operations and the financial position of D&E
Communications after completion of the merger could differ significantly from
the summary unaudited pro forma financial data, which is based on past
operations. Future operations will be affected by various factors including
operating performance, telecommunications industry developments and other
matters.

     You should read the following summary unaudited pro forma financial data
along with the section of this document titled "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Information" and D&E Communications' and Conestoga's
historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes incorporated
by reference in this document.

(1) D&E Communications and Conestoga have historically paid quarterly dividends.

(2) Pro forma information assumes that, in the merger, 55% of the outstanding
    Conestoga common shares were exchanged for cash consideration of $33 and 45%
    of the outstanding Conestoga common shares were exchanged for D&E
    Communications common stock at an exchange ratio of 1.7479 shares of D&E
    Communications common stock

    for each share of Conestoga common stock. The exchange ratio was determined
    assuming a D&E Communications share price of $18.88, which represents the
    closing price on December 21, 2001. As discussed in more detail elsewhere in
    this document, the final structure of the merger consideration and the
    exchange ratio for the stock portion of the merger consideration will not be
    known until the merger is completed.

(3) For more information on the effect of changes in merger consideration
    structure on the pro forma information, see Note 5 to the Unaudited Pro
    Forma Financial Statements on pages 82 through 83.

(4) The Conestoga equivalent pro forma information shows the effect of the
    merger from the perspective of an owner of Conestoga common stock. We
    calculated the Conestoga equivalent information by multiplying the D&E
    Communications and Conestoga combined pro forma per share amounts by an
    assumed exchange ratio of 1.7479. This ratio is based on a D&E
    Communications common stock share price of $18.88, which represents the
    closing price on December 21, 2001. The actual exchange ratio that Conestoga
    stockholders will experience in the merger will not be known until the
    merger is completed and fluctuates based on the quoted market price of D&E
    Communication's common stock.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In considering whether to vote in favor of the proposal relating to the
merger, you should consider all of the information included in this document and
its annexes and all of the information included in the documents we have
incorporated by reference. In particular, you should consider the following risk
factors.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER IS SUBJECT
TO CHANGES BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS COMMON
STOCK, CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN $33.00 IN VALUE FOR EACH
SHARE OF CONESTOGA COMMON STOCK CONVERTED INTO D&E COMMUNICATIONS COMMON STOCK.

     The merger consideration Conestoga shareholders will receive at the time of
the merger may be adversely affected by changes in the market price of D&E
Communications common stock. The number of shares of D&E Communications common
stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be determined based upon
the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications common
stock for the twenty trading days, during which trading in D&E Communications
common stock occurred, immediately preceding the second business day before we
complete the merger. The volume weighted average per share price of D&E
Communications common stock determined in this manner may vary from the market
price at the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the
Conestoga special shareholders meeting or the effective time of the merger. If
the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications common
stock during the measurement period is less than $13.00, the exchange ratio will
be fixed at 2.5385. Consequently, the expected value of the stock portion of the
merger consideration will decrease if the volume weighted average per share
sales price for the measurement period is less than $13.00. In addition,
Conestoga may choose not to exercise its right to terminate the merger agreement
if the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications
common stock for any ten consecutive trading days, during which trading of D&E
Communications common stock occurs, is less than $8.00. Thus, a decrease in the
price per share of D&E Communications common stock could result in Conestoga
shareholders receiving less than $33.00 in value for each share of Conestoga
common stock that is converted into D&E Communications common stock. For
example, if the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E
Communications common stock is $8.00, the aggregate per share consideration
received by Conestoga shareholders would be approximately $27.29 and, if the
volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications common stock
is $7.00, the aggregate per share consideration received by Conestoga
shareholders would be $26.15. We encourage Conestoga shareholders to obtain
current market quotations of the D&E Communications common stock, which is
listed on Nasdaq under the symbol "DECC."

SOME CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT RECEIVE THEIR REQUESTED FORM OF MERGER
CONSIDERATION.

     The merger agreement provides that the merger consideration will be paid in
cash, D&E Communications common stock or a combination of cash and D&E
Communications common stock. In the event that the aggregate number of shares of
Conestoga common stock for which cash elections are received is greater than 55%
of the number of shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, some of the shares for which elections for
100% cash have been made will be converted into the right to receive stock
consideration in the manner described under "The Merger Agreement -- Proration
Adjustment" on pages 58 through 59. In addition, D&E Communications will issue a
maximum of 9,467,068 shares in the merger. As a result, if the aggregate number
of shares of Conestoga common stock for which stock elections are received would
result in the issuance of more than the maximum number of shares of D&E
Communications common stock to be issued in the merger, some of the shares for
which elections for 100% stock have been made will be converted into the right
to receive cash consideration in the manner described under "The Merger
Agreement -- Proration Adjustment" on pages 58 through 59. Accordingly, holders
of Conestoga common stock who elect to receive 100% cash or 100% D&E
Communications common stock may not receive their requested form of merger
consideration. Conestoga shareholders who elect to receive cash for 55% of their
shares of Conestoga common stock and D&E Communications common stock for 45% of
their shares of Conestoga common stock will, however, receive this
consideration.

THE D&E COMMUNICATIONS COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT
RECEIVE TAX DEFERRED TREATMENT IN WHICH CASE CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS MAY NEED TO
OBTAIN FUNDS TO PAY THEIR TAX LIABILITY.

     Under certain circumstances, as discussed under "Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences," the conversion of Conestoga common stock into the merger
consideration may be fully taxable to Conestoga shareholders. In that event,
Conestoga shareholders who receive only D&E Communications common stock in
exchange for their Conestoga shares will need to obtain funds from other sources
to satisfy their tax liability in connection with the merger. Even if a
Conestoga shareholder receives a combination of cash and D&E Communications
common stock, the cash received may not be sufficient to satisfy tax
liabilities.

SOME OF THE CONDITIONS TO CLOSING MAY RESULT IN DELAY OR PREVENT COMPLETION OF
THE MERGER, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANIES' SECURITIES.

     Completion of the merger is conditioned upon our receipt of certain
governmental consents and approvals, including consents and approvals required
by the Federal Communications Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission, as well as approvals required under United States antitrust laws.
Failure to obtain these consents would prevent consummation of the merger. Even
if the approvals are obtained, the effort involved may delay consummation of the
merger. Governmental authorities may also impose conditions in connection with
the merger that may adversely affect the combined company's operations after the
merger. Any of these events could have a negative impact on the value of
Conestoga and D&E Communications securities.

RISKS RELATING TO OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY THE BUSINESS
OPERATIONS OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS AND CONESTOGA AND SUCH INABILITY COULD HAVE AN
ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS PROFITABILITY.

     Although the D&E Communications and Conestoga boards of directors have each
determined that the merger is in the best interests of their respective
companies, the integration of the two companies systems' and operations will
involve significant risks. D&E Communications and Conestoga are located in close
geographic proximity; however, the two companies have different operating
support systems, including billing, accounting, order management, toll rating,
trouble reporting and customer service systems, which may be difficult to
integrate. In addition, some of Conestoga's employees are members of an
organized labor union and are subject to the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement. Because D&E Communications' employees are not unionized, management
of the combined company may face difficulties in integrating employees with
different work rules. Even if integration of the operating systems and employees
is ultimately successful, the amount of management attention diverted to
integration efforts may limit their ability to work on other business matters.
If the combined company does not realize anticipated operating efficiencies, its
profitability could suffer.

D&E COMMUNICATIONS' INCREASED FINANCIAL LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER COULD
RESTRICT ITS OPERATIONS.

     As of September 30, 2001, D&E Communications had approximately $47.0
million in long-term debt. As of September 30, 2001, on a pro forma basis
reflecting the merger, D&E long-term debt is approximately $262.1 million. This
increased leverage could restrict the combined company's operations after the
merger due to the following factors, among others:

     - the combined company will use a substantial portion of its cash flow from
       operations, if any, to pay principal and interest on its debt, which
       would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital
       expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

     - the combined company's indebtedness may limit its ability to obtain
       additional financing on satisfactory terms, if at all;

     - insufficient cash flow from operations may cause the combined company to
       attempt to sell assets, restructure or refinance its debt, or seek
       additional equity capital, which the combined company may be unable to do
       at all or on satisfactory terms;

     - the combined company's level of indebtedness may make it more vulnerable
       to economic or industry downturns;

     - the combined company may encounter increasing difficulty in complying
       with the financial and other covenants applicable to its debt, which
       could increase the possibility of a default;

     - the combined company may not have the ability to pay dividends to its
       shareholders;

     - the combined company's debt service obligations increase its
       vulnerabilities to competitive pressures, as it may be more leveraged
       than many of its competitors; and

     - any new financings may impose restrictions that limit management's
       flexibility in operating or expanding the combined company's revenues.

     As of September 30, 2001, on a pro forma basis reflecting the merger and
certain other transactions as described in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Information, D&E Communications has the ability to incur
$30,425,000 of additional debt under its existing credit facilities and its
additional bank commitment letter, subject to various conditions.

THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE, AND THIS COMPETITION
HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE ON SERVICE OFFERINGS. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF
THE MERGER, THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES
WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ITS REVENUES AND EARNINGS.

     As an integrated communications provider, the combined company will face
competition in its business from:

     - competitive local exchange carriers, including Adelphia, Commonwealth
       Telephone Enterprises and XO Communications;

     - wireless communications providers, including Sprint, AT&T Wireless,
       Verizon Wireless, ALLTEL, Nextel, Cingular and VoiceStream;

     - internet service providers, including AOL, EarthLink and MSN;

     - cable television companies, including Adelphia, Comcast, AT&T and Pencor
       Services;

     - provider of communications services such as long distance services,
       including, as a consequence of its recently received regulatory approval
       to provide long distance services in Pennsylvania, Verizon
       Communications; and

     - systems integration providers, including Morefield, Williams, IntelliMark
       and Weidenhammer Systems Corp.

     Many of D&E Communications' and Conestoga's competitors are, or are
affiliated with, major communications companies. As compared to D&E
Communications and Conestoga, these competitors have substantially greater
financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and
more established relationships with a larger base of current and potential
customers. Accordingly, the combined company may not be able to compete
successfully against these large communications providers. In addition, the
combined company cannot assure you that it will be able to achieve or maintain
adequate technology. Accordingly, the combined company may be unable to compete
effectively in any of its markets.

THE FAILURE TO SELL THE WIRELESS BUSINESSES OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS AND CONESTOGA
WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE COMBINED COMPANY'S EXPECTED RESOURCES
AVAILABLE FOR THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS, AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS.

     D&E Wireless, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of D&E
Communications, is currently under contract with affiliates of VoiceStream to
sell its partnership interest in D&E/Omnipoint Wireless Joint Venture, L.P.
(which does business as PCS One). If the sale is not consummated, D&E
Communications will not realize the expected cash proceeds from the sale, and
those proceeds will not be available for use toward payment of the cash portion
of the merger consideration or the operation of the business after the merger.
In

addition, as contemplated by the merger agreement, D&E Communications and
Conestoga intend to dispose of Conestoga's wireless assets and business. Due to
pre-existing contractual commitments, the combined company may be required
shortly after the merger to dispose of that portion of Conestoga's wireless
business operated in the Reading, Pennsylvania market, which represents
approximately 37% of the population area serviced by such business. The proceeds
to be realized by the combined company from a sale of Conestoga's wireless
assets and business are uncertain. Until the Conestoga wireless business is
sold, the combined company will continue to operate this business. This
continued operation of the wireless business may adversely affect the combined
company's other businesses by requiring additional financing for its operations,
or result in the incurrence of financial losses and other liabilities.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MUST SECURE UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS AT REASONABLE RATES
OR ITS COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER EXPANSION MAY BE DELAYED AND ITS
QUALITY OF SERVICE MAY DECLINE.

     In providing their competitive local exchange carrier services, D&E
Communications and Conestoga interconnect with and use other telephone
companies' networks to access certain of their customers. Therefore, D&E
Communications and Conestoga depend, in certain circumstances, upon the
technology and capabilities of these other telephone companies, the quality and
availability of other telephone companies' copper lines and other telephone
companies' maintenance of these lines. D&E Communications and Conestoga must
also maintain efficient procedures for ordering, provisioning, maintaining and
repairing lines from the incumbent telephone companies. The combined company may
not be able to obtain the copper lines and services it requires from other
telephone companies of satisfactory quality, or on other satisfactory terms and
conditions, in which case it may experience delays in the expansion of its
competitive local exchange carrier networks and the degradation of the quality
of its services to customers.

     D&E Communications and Conestoga also provide digital subscriber line
services. To provide unbundled digital subscriber line-capable lines that
connect each end-user to equipment, D&E Communications and Conestoga rely on
other telephone companies outside of their franchise territories. The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 generally requires that charges for these
unbundled network elements be cost-based and nondiscriminatory. Charges for
digital subscriber line-capable lines and other unbundled network elements may
vary based on rates proposed by other telephone companies and approved by state
regulatory commissions. Increases in these rates could harm the combined
company's local exchange carrier business.

SUCCESSFUL EXPANSION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE
CARRIER OPERATIONS INTO NEW MARKETS IS DEPENDENT ON INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS,
PERMITS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN THESE AGREEMENTS AND PERMITS
COULD HAMPER ITS EXPANSION.

     The successful expansion of the combined company's competitive local
exchange carrier operations will depend, in part, on its ability to implement
existing interconnection agreements and to enter into and implement new
interconnection agreements as it seeks to expand into new markets. The combined
company's failure to obtain these agreements and permits could hamper its
expansion. Interconnection agreements are subject to negotiation and
interpretation by the parties to the agreements and are subject to state
regulatory commission, Federal Communications Commission and judicial oversight.
If the terms of these interconnection agreements need to be renegotiated, the
combined company may not be able to renegotiate existing or enter into new
interconnection agreements in a timely manner on favorable terms. The combined
company must also maintain existing, and obtain new, local permits, including
rights to utilize underground conduit and pole space and other rights-of-way.
The combined company may not be able to maintain its existing permits and rights
or obtain and maintain other required permits and rights on acceptable terms.
Cancellation or nonrenewal of interconnection agreements, permits, rights-of-way
or other arrangements could significantly harm the combined company's business.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN REGULATORY
ENVIRONMENT THAT MAY REQUIRE IT TO ALTER ITS BUSINESS PLANS AND FACE INCREASED
COMPETITION.

     The United States communications industry is subject to federal, state and
other regulations that are continually evolving. As new communications laws and
regulations are issued, the combined company may be

required to modify its business plans or operations. The combined company may
not be able to do so in a cost-effective manner. Federal and state regulatory
trends in favor of reduced regulation are likely to have both positive and
negative effects on the combined company and its ability to compete. The
regulatory environment governing incumbent local exchange carrier operations has
been and will likely continue to be very liberal in its approach to promoting
competition and network access, which may increase the likelihood of new
competitors offering similar services to the combined company's service area.
The introduction of new competitors could have a negative effect on the combined
companies' revenues and earnings.

D&E COMMUNICATIONS AND CONESTOGA HAVE EACH RECEIVED A LIMITED EXEMPTION FROM
CERTAIN INTERCONNECTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996. UPON
EXPIRATION OF THE EXEMPTION, THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
COMPETITION FOR ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

     D&E Communications' and Conestoga's incumbent local exchange carrier
services have received a limited suspension until July 2002 from certain
interconnection requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The
exemption protects the interconnection services in D&E Communications' and
Conestoga's incumbent service territories by excluding the companies from
requirements to allow competitors access to their customers via interconnection
or resale agreements. If the combined company does not receive additional
extensions of these suspensions, competitors may be allowed to enter the
combined company's territories and use its lines to provide competitive
services. The introduction of new competitors could have a negative effect on
the combined company's revenues and earnings.

PROXIES

Conestoga:

     Completed Proxies.  All shares of Conestoga common stock represented by
properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting of Conestoga
shareholders and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated in those proxies.

     Proxies with No Instructions.  If no instructions are indicated on a
properly executed returned proxy, Conestoga will vote such proxy "FOR" the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

     Abstentions.  Abstentions may be specified for any of the proposals being
considered at the Conestoga special meeting. A properly executed proxy marked
"ABSTAIN" will be counted as present for purposes of determining if there is a
quorum and for purposes of determining the aggregate voting power and number of
shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting but will have no effect
with respect to approval of the merger proposal.

     Broker Voting.  Brokers who hold shares in "street name" for customers may
not exercise their voting discretion with respect to proposals for non-routine
matters such as the merger proposal. If beneficial owners of Conestoga shares do
not give brokers specific instructions as to how to vote their shares, brokers
cannot vote such shares with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger
proposal. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Shares represented by
broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining if there
is a quorum and for purposes of determining the aggregate voting power and
number of shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting but will have
no effect with respect to approval of the merger proposal.

D&E Communications:

     Completed Proxies.  All shares of D&E Communications common stock
represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special
meeting of D&E Communications shareholders and not revoked, will be voted in

properly executed returned proxy, D&E Communications will vote such proxy "FOR"
the share issuance proposal.

     Abstentions.  Abstentions may be specified for any of the proposals being
considered at the D&E Communications special meeting. A properly executed proxy
marked "ABSTAIN" will be counted as present for purposes of determining if there
is a quorum and for purposes of determining the aggregate voting power and
number of shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting but will have
no effect with respect to approval of the issuance of D&E Communications common
stock in connection with the merger.

     Broker Voting.  Brokers who hold shares in "street name" for customers may
not exercise their voting discretion with respect to proposals for non-routine
matters such as the issuance of D&E Communications common stock in connection
with the merger. If beneficial owners of D&E Communications shares do not give
brokers specific instructions as to how to vote their shares, brokers cannot
vote such shares with respect to the approval and adoption of any merger
proposal. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Shares represented by
broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining if there
is a quorum and for purposes of determining the aggregate voting power and
number of shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting but will have
no effect with respect to approval of the issuance of D&E Communications common
stock in connection with the merger.

REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before its use by:

     - delivering to the Secretary of Conestoga or the Secretary of D&E
       Communications, as the case may be, a signed notice of revocation or a
       later-dated, signed proxy; or

     - by attending the meeting and voting in person.

     Merely attending the meeting does not mean that you have revoked your
proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     The boards of directors of each of Conestoga and D&E Communications are
soliciting the proxies of Conestoga shareholders and D&E Communications
shareholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, we will make arrangements
with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send the
proxy materials to beneficial owners. Both Conestoga and D&E Communications
will, upon request, reimburse such brokerage houses and custodians for their
reasonable expenses in assisting with the solicitation of proxies.

Neither Conestoga nor D&E Communications plan on engaging a third-party to help
solicit proxies. If necessary, Conestoga or D&E Communications, as the case may
be, may request the return of proxy cards by personal interview, mail,
telephone, facsimile or other means of electronic transmission. The extent to
which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how soon proxy cards are
returned. Please send in your proxy card immediately.

     CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR
PROXY CARDS. STOCK CERTIFICATES SHOULD BE MAILED WITH THE ELECTION FORM THAT
WILL BE SENT TO EACH CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDER ALONG WITH THIS DOCUMENT, ACCORDING
TO THE INSTRUCTIONS PRINTED ON THE FORM.

     As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the Conestoga
board of directors and the D&E Communications board of directors do not know of
any business to be presented at the meetings other than the proposals described
above. If any other matters should properly come before either meeting, it is
intended that the shares represented by proxies will be voted with respect to
such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons voting such proxies.
Conestoga or D&E Communications might also ask their respective shareholders to
vote upon a proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting for the purpose,
among others, of allowing additional time for the solicitation of additional
votes to approve the merger proposal. Proxies voted "AGAINST" the merger
proposal will not be used to vote for any adjournment under this authority.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND AND NEGOTIATION OF THE MERGER

     In light of market conditions and trends in the telecommunications
industry, the Conestoga board of directors has considered, on a periodic basis,
strategic alternatives designed to maintain the competitiveness of Conestoga and
to enable Conestoga to maximize its value to its shareholders. In its
evaluation, the Conestoga board of directors recognized that significant
challenges faced Conestoga in a changing competitive and economic environment.
Specifically, the market price of Conestoga's stock was perceived to be low, in
terms of industry valuations, peer company market values and a "sum of the
parts" valuation. Market sources indicated that a principal reason for
Conestoga's low relative stock price was a lack of market following and research
which was in turn caused by the fact that Conestoga lacked size, in terms of
market capitalization and otherwise, in relation to others in its industry.
However, growth through stock acquisitions appeared to be difficult for
Conestoga given its low stock price (and the resulting dilution of existing
shareholders).

     In addition, Conestoga had a large number of shareholders who were
accustomed to the regular quarterly dividends paid by Conestoga. However, given
its decreased earnings per share resulting from capital investments necessary to
compete in a changing competitive and technological environment, increased costs
resulting from expansion and the need for investment capital, Conestoga's board
of directors recognized that there was pressure to decrease or eliminate its
dividend payout (although there was a concern that a decrease in the dividend
could cause a further decline in the market price of Conestoga common stock). In
effect, industry factors were causing companies such as Conestoga to become
growth companies, rather than traditional utilities with emphasis on income.

     Beginning in May 2000, Conestoga's board of directors focused its
consideration on strategic alternatives relating to Conestoga's wireless
operations. As a result of a planning retreat attended by Conestoga's board of
directors and management, the board of directors requested management to report
back to it in August 2000 with respect to strategic alternatives involving
Conestoga Wireless Company. At its August 22, 2000 meeting, the Conestoga board
of directors considered strategic alternatives for Conestoga's wireless
operations, including finding a strategic partner for the operations, selling
the operations and selling its telecommunications towers. As a consequence, Legg
Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated was engaged on September 21, 2000 to assist
Conestoga with the sale of its telecommunication towers. Conestoga's board of
directors and management held another planning retreat on September 22, 2000 to
explore further options to address strategic alternatives for the entire
company, including those already addressed in respect of the wireless
operations.

     At a November 30, 2000 meeting of the Conestoga board of directors,
representatives of Legg Mason made a presentation to the Conestoga board of
directors regarding potential strategic alternatives for Conestoga, including
pursuing the company's business plan as an independent company or engaging in a
"strategic transaction." The option of remaining independent included engaging
in an acquisition program, seeking strategic relationships and/or exiting
selected businesses. Strategic transactions included the possibility of a
combination with a similar company, or a sale of the company in a negotiated
transaction with a selected party or through an auction process involving a
selected group of bidders. After extensive discussion of these alternatives, the
Conestoga board of directors determined to continue to evaluate Conestoga's
strategic alternatives.

     Over the next several weeks following its November 30, 2000 meeting,
Conestoga's board of directors reached a consensus that a sale of some or all of
Conestoga might be in Conestoga's best interest. The board reached this
consensus after consideration of the strategic alternatives available to
Conestoga. Specifically, the Conestoga board of directors evaluated remaining
independent, selling its Telebeam subsidiary, selling its wireless operations
and selling the entire company. Legg Mason provided the Conestoga board of
directors with valuation methodologies and ranges of values which might be
realized under each scenario. In terms of valuation methodologies, Legg Mason
reviewed with the Conestoga board methods of valuation, including discounted
cash flow, comparable company analysis and comparable merger and acquisition
transactions analysis. These analyses resulted in various valuations, with the
sale of the entire company resulting in the

highest projected value. After discussing and analyzing the issues involved in
each course of action, the Conestoga board of directors concluded that a sale of
the entire company may be in the best interests of Conestoga. Conestoga engaged
Legg Mason as of February 1, 2001 to act as its financial advisor in connection
with a possible sale transaction. The Conestoga board of directors directed Legg
Mason to solicit preliminary indications of interest from third parties in
acquiring Conestoga and to determine the range of values to be reasonably
expected for any possible sale transaction. Conestoga's board of directors and
Legg Mason discussed which companies they believed to be the most likely
interested parties based on perceived strategic fit and potential ability and
willingness to pay a premium price for Conestoga. The Conestoga board of
directors did not place any limitations on Legg Mason with regard to which
potentially interested parties should be contacted. At or about this time
Conestoga engaged Barley Snyder Senft & Cohen, LLC, as legal counsel to assist
the board of directors in this process.

     At a February 27, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board of directors, Legg
Mason and Barley Snyder reviewed a valuation analysis and a proposed sale
process with the Conestoga board of directors.

     Through May, 2001, Legg Mason contacted a number of potential strategic and
financial buyers. A number of the companies contacted expressed interest and
entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Conestoga. After
entering into a confidentiality agreement, each company was permitted to conduct
due diligence investigations of Conestoga. As part of the due diligence process,
Conestoga management provided each of these companies with certain confidential
information relating to Conestoga.

     At an April 20, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board of directors, Legg
Mason and Barley Snyder updated the Conestoga board of directors regarding the
sale process, including a review of the parties that appeared to be interested
in a transaction with Conestoga, and reviewed with the Conestoga board of
directors a draft bid procedures letter and a form of agreement and plan of
merger to be presented to interested parties.

     On April 27, 2001, Conestoga issued a press release announcing that it had
engaged Legg Mason to assist Conestoga in exploring strategic alternatives.

     In late April, 2001, interested parties were provided with a letter setting
forth the procedures for the submission of definitive written acquisition
proposals for the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of
Conestoga. Attached to the procedures letter was a draft of a merger agreement
which interested parties were instructed to comment upon in writing for
inclusion with their bids. While the draft merger agreement contemplated a cash
transaction, the procedures letter indicated that the Conestoga board of
directors was willing to consider a transaction involving marketable securities.
Proposals were required to be submitted in writing by May 24, 2001.

     On May 4, 2001, D&E Communications engaged Jefferies and Company, Inc. to
act as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with strategic planning and
the development of a long term growth strategy. The decision to engage Jefferies
was based in part on periodic consideration by the D&E Communications board of
directors and management of current telecommunications industry trends of
increased competition and consolidation. Although at the time of Jefferies'
engagement the board and management generally viewed a combination with a
similar company as an effective method to address these trends and potentially
to enhance shareholder value, no candidates were at that time identified or
being considered.

     In response to Conestoga's April 27, 2001 press release, in early May 2001,
G. William Ruhl, a director and then a Senior Vice President of D&E
Communications, telephoned Albert Kramer, Conestoga's President to determine if
Conestoga was interested in selling some or all of its operations. Subsequently,
on May 15, 2001, Mr. Ruhl and Garth Sprecher, a director and a vice president
and the secretary of D&E Communications, met with Mr. Kramer to discuss the
possibility of an acquisition by D&E Communications' 50% owned PCS One joint
venture of Conestoga's wireless operations. On May 16, 2001, after consultation
with Jefferies, D&E Communications management determined to pursue an
acquisition by D&E Communications of Conestoga. In the ensuing eight days D&E
Communications, together with its legal and financial advisors, conducted due
diligence on Conestoga and formulated its offer, which was submitted on May 24,
2001, the deadline for proposals imposed by Conestoga.

     On May 29, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met by teleconference for
the purpose of reviewing with management, Legg Mason and Barley Snyder the five
proposals received (including initial proposals from NTELOS Inc. and D&E
Communications) and to discuss how to proceed with the bidding parties. The
Conestoga board of directors directed management and its financial and legal
advisors to seek clarification of the proposals for the purposes of a
presentation at a board of directors meeting to be held on June 1, 2001.

     On June 1, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met and reviewed in
detail the five proposals. At that meeting, Barley Snyder advised the Conestoga
board of directors as to certain legal aspects of the proposals, including the
proposed comments to the form of merger agreement provided to each bidder. At
that time, Conestoga's board of directors determined to continue the sale
process with all of the bidders in an effort to negotiate terms as advantageous
to Conestoga as possible.

     On June 4, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met with Barley Snyder to
discuss the status of the sale process and directed Legg Mason to continue its
discussions with the bidders to clarify the bids in certain respects, obtain the
best price and structure possible and seek assurance with respect to the
financing of the cash portion of each bid. Conestoga's board of directors
indicated a preference for a structure in which stock of an acquirer made up a
sufficient portion of the consideration to be paid so as to achieve "tax-free"
treatment of the stock portion of a bid and a mechanism whereby, within limits,
the stock portion of a bid would result in a fixed price. Legg Mason continued a
dialogue with the various bidders through June, 2001 and periodically updated
the Conestoga board of directors by teleconference on each of June 8, 11, 22 and
26, 2001.

     At a June 28, 2001 meeting, based on its analysis of the pricing, structure
and certainty of consummation of the various bids, the Conestoga board of
directors determined to focus on the NTELOS and D&E Communications bids and
instructed management, Legg Mason and Barley Snyder to continue to negotiate
with NTELOS and D&E Communications.

     On July 2, 2001, NTELOS submitted a detailed proposal to Conestoga's board
of directors indicating that it would be willing to purchase all of the
outstanding capital stock of Conestoga for $36 per share, based on a fixed price
structure (through a variable exchange ratio) within a range of per share market
prices for NTELOS stock of $21 to $27, in exchange for NTELOS common stock and
cash, with no more than 50% of the aggregate merger consideration being paid in
cash. Attached to the letter was a firm commitment from Welsh Carson Anderson &
Stowe to purchase between $75 and $150 million in equity securities in order to
fund the cash portion of the merger consideration. On that date, the
then-current D&E Communications' bid was $32 per share, based on a fixed price
structure (through a variable exchange ratio) within a range of per share market
prices for D&E Communications stock of $16.91 to $22.21, in exchange for D&E
Communications common stock and cash, with a fixed ratio of 55%/45% of the
aggregate merger consideration being paid in cash and D&E Communications common
stock, respectively.

     At a July 3, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board of directors, the
Conestoga board of directors decided, based on the then-current D&E
Communications and NTELOS bids, to authorize Conestoga's advisors to further
negotiate D&E Communication's bid (such negotiation resulting in a revised bid
of $33), and attempt to negotiate an agreement with D&E Communications. D&E
Communications and NTELOS were immediately informed by Legg Mason of the
decision of the Conestoga board of directors.

     On July 5, 2001, NTELOS submitted an unsolicited revised proposal pursuant
to which it offered to increase the merger consideration from $36 to $39 per
share and to increase the cash component of the merger consideration to a
maximum of 60% of the merger consideration. Attached to the letter was a revised
commitment of Welsh Carson to purchase between $75 and $200 million in equity
securities in order to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration.

     On July 6, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met by teleconference to
respond to NTELOS' revised bid. D&E Communications was immediately notified by
Legg Mason of the fact that an improved bid had been received.

     On July 9, 2001, D&E Communications submitted an unsolicited revised
proposal pursuant to which it offered merger consideration of $38 per share
based on the price of D&E Communications common stock on July 6, 2001. The
merger consideration was to be paid 43% in shares of D&E Communications common
stock

and 57% in cash. The stock portion of the merger consideration was based on a
fixed exchange ratio. As a result, value of the stock portion of the
consideration to be received by Conestoga shareholders was variable, depending
on the value of the D&E Communications stock at closing. The Conestoga board of
directors met by teleconference to discuss D&E Communications' revised proposal
and immediately notified NTELOS of the fact that an improved competing bid had
been received.

     Later on July 9, 2001, NTELOS submitted an unsolicited revised bid of $40
per share payable in cash and NTELOS common stock, with a maximum of 59% of the
merger consideration payable in cash. The stock portion of the merger proposal
was based on a fixed price structure (through a variable exchange ratio) within
a range of per share market prices for NTELOS stock of $18 to $30.

     The Conestoga board of directors met on July 10, 2001 to review the revised
bids of NTELOS and D&E Communications. The Conestoga board of directors approved
NTELOS' bid, subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement. Beginning July
10, 2001, Conestoga agreed to be bound by an exclusivity agreement with NTELOS
pursuant to which Conestoga was prohibited from soliciting other offers or
participating in discussions with other parties regarding a business combination
prior to July 31, 2001. During the ensuing two-week period representatives of
Conestoga, Legg Mason and Barley Snyder continued negotiations of a definitive
agreement with representatives of NTELOS and its legal advisors.

     From July 11 through July 24, 2001, NTELOS' legal advisors had numerous
contacts with Barley Snyder concerning unresolved issues, including the
circumstances under which the merger agreement could be terminated, Conestoga's
option plans and grants, employee matters and the non-solicitation of other
offers. Due to the cash requirements associated with obligations of Conestoga in
connection with a change of control, the parties agreed in the course of these
negotiations to a reduction in the maximum cash component of the merger
consideration to be paid by NTELOS from 59% to 58%.

     On July 24, 2001, representatives of NTELOS informed representatives of
Conestoga that the NTELOS board had approved the merger agreement subject to the
approval of the merger agreement by the Conestoga board of directors.

     At a July 24, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board of directors, Legg Mason,
Conestoga's management and Barley Snyder reviewed developments in the
negotiation process following the July 10, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board
of directors. Barley Snyder reviewed the terms of the proposed merger agreement
that had been reached with NTELOS and reviewed the fiduciary duties of the board
of directors in the matters under consideration. Legg Mason rendered its written
opinion, that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the
matters stated in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair from a
financial point of view to shareholders of Conestoga. After considerable
discussion and consideration, Conestoga's board of directors voted unanimously
to approve the NTELOS merger and the NTELOS merger agreement and to recommend to
Conestoga shareholders that they vote to approve the NTELOS merger agreement.
Following the meeting, Conestoga finalized and executed the NTELOS merger
agreement and related agreements and documents. On the morning of July 25, 2001,
before the U.S. financial markets opened for trading, Conestoga and NTELOS
announced the signing of the NTELOS merger agreement.

     The closing price of NTELOS common stock on the date prior to the
announcement of the NTELOS merger agreement was $24.00 per share. Within a range
of per share market prices for NTELOS stock of $18 to $30, the consideration to
be received by Conestoga's shareholders would have been $40.00 per share.
Subsequent to the date of the NTELOS merger agreement, the market price of
NTELOS common stock declined to $6.85 per share on September 20, 2001.
Thereafter, the average closing price of NTELOS common stock between October 10,
2001 and November 20, 2001 was $8.35 per share. At an $8.35 NTELOS stock price,
the consideration to Conestoga's shareholders would have been $27.35 per share,
with 40% in cash and 60% in stock (the percentage of merger consideration
represented by NTELOS stock was required to be increased at lower NTELOS market
prices to maintain tax-free treatment of the transaction).

     On September 24, 2001, Anne Sweigart, Chairman and President of D&E
Communications, telephoned John Bentz, Conestoga's Chairman, to describe a
letter she intended to send to Mr. Bentz proposing that D&E Communications
acquire Conestoga in a cash and stock transaction. The letter, which was
subsequently sent

to Mr. Bentz, provided for a price of $33.00 per share, with 55% and 45% of the
merger consideration in cash and D&E Communications' common stock, respectively.
Pursuant to obligations under the NTELOS merger agreement, Conestoga promptly
informed NTELOS of the letter from D&E Communications as well as subsequent
developments relating to D&E Communications' proposal.

     The closing price of NTELOS common stock on September 21, the last trading
day before the September 24 unsolicited proposal by D&E Communications, was
$7.75 per share. At a $7.75 NTELOS stock price, the consideration to be received
by Conestoga's shareholders would have been $26.16 per share, with 40% in cash
and 60% in stock.

     On October 3, 2001, Mrs. Sweigart again telephoned Mr. Bentz to express D&E
Communications' continued interest in acquiring Conestoga and to notify him that
D&E Communications intended to clarify its proposal by transmitting a proposed
form of merger agreement based on the NTELOS document. Later that day, special
legal counsel to D&E Communications, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, transmitted to
Legg Mason and Barley Snyder the form of merger agreement D&E Communications
proposed for its acquisition of Conestoga.

     Beginning on October 5, 2001, representatives of Conestoga and D&E
Communications had various contacts for the purpose of clarifying D&E
Communications' proposal, including the ability of D&E Communications to finance
the cash portion of its proposal and the extent to which D&E Communications'
proposal would be conditioned on other contingencies.

     On October 15, 2001, Mrs. Sweigart transmitted another letter to Mr. Bentz,
attached to which was a copy of a commitment letter dated the same date from D&E
Communications' lender, CoBank ACB, which letter indicated CoBank's willingness
to provide financing to enable D&E Communications to finance the cash portion of
its proposal.

     On October 17, 2001, Mrs. Sweigart sent to each member of the Conestoga
board of directors copies of the previous transmittals to Mr. Bentz together
with a presentation illustrating the superiority of D&E Communications' proposal
to the existing NTELOS transaction.

     On October 24, 2001, representatives of Conestoga and D&E Communications
met to clarify further issues relating to the ability of D&E Communications to
consummate the proposed transaction, particularly the commitment of CoBank to
provide D&E Communications with financing and the agreement to sell to
affiliates of VoiceStream Wireless Corporation D&E Wireless' (which is an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of D&E Communications) interest in the joint
venture with VoiceStream that operates a wireless business. Subsequent to the
meeting of October 24, 2001, Conestoga's representatives conducted additional
due diligence relating to the ability of D&E Communications to consummate the
proposed transaction.

     On November 5, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met and concluded
that the D&E Communications bid represented a "Superior Competing Transaction"
under the merger agreement with NTELOS. The Conestoga board of directors further
determined to provide notice to NTELOS that it intended to participate in
discussions and negotiations with D&E Communications regarding its proposal as
permitted by the merger agreement with NTELOS. The closing price of NTELOS
common stock on November 2, 2001, the trading day preceding the determination by
Conestoga's board of directors that the D&E Communications bid constituted a
"Superior Competing Proposal," was $7.76 per share. At a $7.76 NTELOS stock
price, the consideration to be received by Conestoga's shareholders would have
been $26.18 per share, with 40% in cash and 60% in stock.

     Representatives of D&E Communications and Conestoga negotiated a
conditional merger agreement which was to be effective only upon termination of
Conestoga's merger agreement with NTELOS and which was subject to the right of
NTELOS to make a counteroffer in accordance with the terms of the NTELOS merger
agreement. Specifically, the transaction contemplated by the D&E Communications
conditional merger agreement was contingent upon NTELOS failing to amend the
terms of the NTELOS merger agreement within the following ten business days, so
that the D&E Communications transaction no longer represented a Superior
Competing Transaction. If NTELOS failed to make such a counter offer, Conestoga

would have the right to terminate the NTELOS merger agreement upon the payment
of a termination fee of $10 million.

     The D&E Communications conditional merger agreement provided for the
acquisition by D&E Communications of all of the outstanding shares of Conestoga
common stock for $33 per share, based on a fixed price structure (through a
variable exchange ratio) within a range of per share market prices for D&E
Communications common stock of $13 to $23, and on the other terms now reflected
in the merger agreement.

     From November 9, 2001 until November 19, 2001, D&E Communications
management and its legal and financial advisors conducted a due diligence review
of Conestoga, and Conestoga management and its legal and financial advisors
conducted a due diligence review of D&E Communications.

     On November 19, 2001, the Conestoga board of directors met to consider the
conditional merger agreement with D&E Communications. Legg Mason and Conestoga's
management and counsel reviewed for the board of directors developments in the
negotiation process since the November 5, 2001 meeting of the Conestoga board of
directors. Barley Snyder reviewed the terms of the proposed agreement that had
been reached with D&E Communications and again reviewed the fiduciary duties of
the board of directors in the matters under consideration. Legg Mason rendered
its written opinion, that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and
subject to the matters stated in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair
from a financial point of view to shareholders of Conestoga. The Conestoga board
of directors adjourned its meeting until November 21, 2001. On that date, after
considerable discussion and consideration, the Conestoga board of directors
voted unanimously to approve the merger and the conditional merger agreement
with D&E Communications, to recommend to Conestoga shareholders that they vote
to approve the merger agreement and to withdraw its recommendation in favor of
the NTELOS merger agreement.

     On November 19, 2001, the D&E Communications board of directors met to
consider the proposed merger with Conestoga. Morgan Lewis reviewed the fiduciary
duties of the board of directors with regard to the proposed transaction and
described the terms of the conditional merger agreement with Conestoga.
Jefferies reviewed with the D&E Communications board of directors the basis of
its analysis of the proposed transaction with Conestoga and rendered its oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of the date of the opinion
and subject to the qualifications stated in its opinion, the proposed merger was
fair from a financial point of view to D&E Communications. The D&E
Communications board of directors engaged in considerable discussion and
deliberation regarding the proposed transaction. It determined to delegate
authority to approve the final terms of the proposed merger with Conestoga, the
conditional merger agreement and the issuance of D&E Communications common stock
in the merger to a Special Transactions Committee of the board of directors
comprised of Mrs. Sweigart, Robert M. Lauman, Mr. Ruhl and Thomas H. Bamford.
With one director abstaining, the remaining members of the D&E Communications
board of directors then unanimously approved the merger with Conestoga, the
conditional merger agreement and the contemplated issuance of D&E Communications
common stock in the transaction, subject in each case to the approval of the
final terms of the transaction by the Special Transactions Committee.

     From the conclusion of the meeting of the D&E Communications board of
directors and the adjournment of the meeting of the Conestoga board of
directors, each on November 19, 2001, through the evening of November 20, 2001,
the respective legal and financial advisors of D&E Communications and Conestoga
continued to negotiate the final terms and conditions of the conditional merger
agreement.

     On November 21, 2001, the Special Transactions Committee of the D&E
Communications board of directors held a telephone meeting to discuss
developments with Conestoga following the November 19, 2001 meeting of the
entire board, including the final terms of the merger with Conestoga and the
conditional merger agreement. After again reviewing applicable fiduciary duties
of the board of directors in the context of the proposed transaction, Morgan
Lewis reviewed with the Special Transactions Committee the revised draft
conditional merger agreement and the substantive changes in the terms of the
proposed transaction and the conditional merger agreement since the November 19,
2001 meeting of the entire board reflected therein. Jefferies rendered its oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of November 21, 2001 and
subject to the qualifications stated in its opinion, the proposed merger was
fair from a financial point of view to D&E Communications. After consideration,
the Special Transactions Committee voted unanimously to

approve the merger with Conestoga, the conditional merger agreement and the
issuance of D&E Communications common stock in the merger.

     D&E Communications and Conestoga executed and announced the signing of the
conditional merger agreement on November 21, 2001 following the completion of
the Conestoga board of directors meeting and the meeting of the Special
Transactions Committee of the D&E Communications board of directors.

     Upon approval of the D&E Communications conditional merger agreement,
Conestoga provided NTELOS with notice that it intended to terminate the NTELOS
merger agreement, subject to the counter offer provisions of the NTELOS
agreement. After the close of business on December 3, 2001, NTELOS notified
Conestoga of its election to terminate the NTELOS merger agreement and accept
the $10 million termination fee provided for in that agreement. The D&E
Communications merger agreement became effective upon termination of the NTELOS
merger agreement. D&E Communications and Conestoga announced the effectiveness
of their merger agreement on December 4, 2001.

     On December 11, 2001, Lynch Interactive Corporation sent a letter to
Conestoga and issued a press release indicating that it would be prepared to
offer, subject to certain conditions, to acquire Conestoga for $33.00 per share
in cash, less any break-up fee payable to D&E Communications under the D&E
Communications merger agreement. On December 17, 2001, Conestoga announced it
would not pursue Lynch's unsolicited indication of interest. Conestoga indicated
that it believed that the indication of interest was not superior to the D&E
Communications merger agreement and that it intended to continue to pursue
consummation of the transaction contemplated by the D&E Communications merger
agreement. On December 20, 2001, Lynch sent Conestoga an unsolicited letter
indicating that it would eliminate the deduction of the D&E termination fee from
the $33.00 per share price included in its previous indication of interest.
Prior to a meeting of the Conestoga board of directors scheduled for December
28, 2001, Conestoga became aware that Lynch had announced that it had withdrawn
its indication of interest to acquire Conestoga.

     On January 9, 2002, D&E Communications and Conestoga agreed to amend and
restate the merger agreement to amend certain procedural matters in the
conditional agreement originally executed on November 21, 2001.

CONESTOGA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONESTOGA BOARD OF
DIRECTORS

     At a special meeting of the Conestoga board of directors on November 19,
2001, the Conestoga board of directors determined that the merger is fair to and
in the best interests of Conestoga and its shareholders and unanimously approved
and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by that
agreement. Accordingly, the Conestoga board of directors recommends that
Conestoga shareholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement at the
special meeting.

     In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by that agreement, and to recommend that Conestoga
shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement, the Board considered the
following material factors:

     - the price of $33.00 per share within a range of D&E Communications' stock
       prices of $13.00 to $23.00, with up to 55% in cash and at least 45% in
       stock in a tax-deferred transaction (versus the NTELOS transaction, at an
       assumed price of $8.35 per share, of $27.35 per share with $16.41 in cash
       and $10.94 in stock in a tax-deferred transaction) was determined to be
       more favorable from a financial point of view;

     - familiarity of the Conestoga board of directors with, and presentations
       by Conestoga's management and its financial advisors regarding, the
       business, operations, properties and assets, financial condition,
       competitive position, business strategy and prospects of Conestoga (as
       well as the risks involved in achieving those prospects), and the current
       environment for the telecommunications industry in which Conestoga
       competes, and current industry, economic and market conditions, both on
       an historical and on a prospective basis;

     - the possible alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of
       continuing to operate Conestoga as an independent entity), the range of
       possible benefits to Conestoga shareholders of such alternatives and the
       timing and likelihood of accomplishing the goal of any such alternatives;

     - the current and historical market prices of Conestoga common stock
       relative to those of other industry participants and general market
       indices;

     - the fact that the merger consideration is in the form of up to 55% in
       cash;

     - the ability of Conestoga's shareholders to receive the D&E Communications
       common stock portion of the merger consideration on a "tax-free" basis
       (assuming the D&E Communications stock price is over $10.60 at closing)
       (assuming (1) 8,287,669 shares of Conestoga common stock are outstanding,
       (2) all outstanding shares of Conestoga preferred stock have been
       converted into common stock, (3) 55% of Conestoga shares of common stock
       are to be converted into cash consideration and 45% of such shares are to
       be converted into D&E Communications common stock, and (4) no cash in
       lieu of fractional shares is paid);

     - the "fixed price" structure of the D&E Communications common stock
       portion of the merger consideration (designed to provide a fixed value of
       $33.00 if, based on the average sales prices for the 20 trading days
       during which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs
       immediately preceding the date that is two business days prior to the
       effective time of the merger, the per share value of D&E Communications'
       common stock is between $13.00 and $23.00 immediately prior to
       consummation of the merger);

     - the fact that D&E Communications currently pays, and has expressed its
       intention to continue to pay, a dividend on its common stock;

     - the potential capital appreciation in D&E Communications' common stock;

     - the extensive sale process conducted by Conestoga involving multiple
       potentially interested parties;

     - the presentations by Legg Mason, and its written opinion dated November
       19, 2001, that, as of the date of such opinion and based on and subject
       to the matters set forth in that opinion, the merger consideration to be
       received by holders of Conestoga common stock pursuant to the merger
       agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (see
       "The Merger -- Opinion of Conestoga's Financial Advisor" on pages 37
       through 39);

     - the terms of the merger agreement that provide that, under certain
       circumstances, and subject to certain conditions more fully described
       under "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation," Conestoga can furnish
       information to and conduct negotiations with a third party in connection
       with an unsolicited potential superior proposal for a business
       combination or acquisition of Conestoga and can terminate the merger
       agreement for a superior proposal (see "The Merger Agreement -- No
       Solicitation" on pages 63 through 64);

     - the potential long-term impact of the transaction on Conestoga employees
       and on the communities and customers Conestoga serves, which the
       Conestoga board of directors believed to be favorable;

     - the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, the completion of
       the merger is not conditioned on D&E Communications' ability to obtain
       financing and on the Board's view of the likelihood that the proposed
       acquisition will be consummated in light of the experience, reputation
       and financial capability of D&E Communications; and

     - the ability of Conestoga to terminate the merger agreement if the average
       per share sales price of D&E Communications' stock for any ten
       consecutive trading days during which trades occur prior to closing is
       less than $8.00.

     The Conestoga board of directors also considered potential drawbacks or
risks relating to the merger, including the following material drawbacks and
risks:

     - Shareholders who receive D&E Communications common stock as part of the
       merger consideration, whether as a result of election or allocation could
       receive less than $33.00 per share in value;

     - the fact that the cash portion of the merger consideration would be
       taxable to Conestoga shareholders for United States federal income tax
       purposes;

     - the increased financial leverage of D&E Communications required to
       finance the cash portion of the merger consideration;

     - the risks inherent in D&E Communications pursuing its strategy of
       becoming a leading regional integrated communications provider;

     - the covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of
       Conestoga's business prior to the consummation of the merger only to
       activities in the ordinary course consistent with past practice as well
       as various other operational restrictions on Conestoga prior to the
       consummation of the merger;

     - The provision in the merger agreement requiring Conestoga to pay a
       termination fee in the amount of approximately $10.0 million if the
       merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances more fully
       described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement -- Effect of
       Termination";

     - The risks and costs to Conestoga if the transaction does not close, which
       risks and costs result from the extensive efforts that would be required
       to attempt to complete the transaction, the significant distractions
       which Conestoga's employees will experience during the pendency of the
       transaction, the payments in connection with the employee benefit matters
       Conestoga could possibly be required to make upon receipt of approval of
       the merger agreement by Conestoga's shareholders even if the merger is
       not consummated and the possibility that Conestoga's stock price could
       decline below the pre-announcement level; and

     - The possibility that, notwithstanding the provisions of the merger
       agreement permitting Conestoga to terminate the merger agreement in
       connection with a superior proposal, the termination fee payable upon
       such termination might discourage other parties that might have an
       interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of, Conestoga
       (see "The Merger Agreement -- Termination of the Merger Agreement").

     The foregoing discussion addresses the material information and some of the
factors considered by the Conestoga board of directors in its consideration of
the merger, including factors that support the merger as well as those that may
weigh against it. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of
information considered, the Conestoga board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determination. The determination to approve the merger and the merger agreement
was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole and the foregoing
discussion does not necessarily contain all of the factors considered by the
Conestoga board of directors as a whole or by individual directors. In addition,
individual members of the Conestoga board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors.

D&E COMMUNICATIONS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE D&E
COMMUNICATIONS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the D&E Communications
board of directors consulted with D&E Communications' legal and financial
advisors as well as with D&E Communications' management. The D&E Communications
board of directors considered a number of material factors, including the
following:

     - the significantly increased market capitalization and public float of the
       combined company, which could reasonably be expected to result in
       enhanced trading liquidity for D&E Communications shareholders following
       the merger;

     - the importance of significant scale, scope and financial resources to the
       combined company's ability to compete effectively in the changing
       telecommunications industry;

     - an analysis of the financial performance, operations, access lines and
       other assets, business condition and business prospects of Conestoga and
       D&E Communications;

     - current industry trends and market conditions, including the likelihood
       of consolidation and increased competition in the telecommunications
       industry;

     - the potential positive impact on the combined company of securing through
       the merger an increased depth of experienced and talented managers;

     - the impact of the merger on the customers and employees of both companies
       as well as on the communities in which they operate;

     - an increased customer base to which the combined company can market its
       telecommunications products;

     - the possibility of achieving cost savings through elimination of cost
       redundancies and increased purchasing power;

     - potential alternative transactions;

     - the terms and conditions of financing arrangements necessary to
       consummate the merger;

     - the financial presentations given and opinion delivered by Jefferies &
       Company, Inc., D&E Communications' financial advisor, to the effect that,
       as of the date of its opinion and based on and subject to the matters
       described in its opinion, the merger is fair, from a financial point of
       view, to D&E Communications, as more fully described below under
       "-- Opinion of D&E Communications' Financial Advisor;"

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the merger, which,
       in the view of the D&E Communications board of directors and management,
       are fair to, and in the best interests of, D&E Communications and D&E
       Communications' shareholders; and

     - the likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfying
       the other conditions to consummation of the merger.

     All combinations, including the merger, involve some risks and
disadvantages. The material potential risks and disadvantages to D&E
Communications shareholders identified by the D&E Communications board of
directors and management in considering the merger include the following:

     - the time and resources required to complete the merger, with the
       completion of the merger being subject to various conditions (see "The
       Merger Agreement -- Conditions");

     - the difficulties inherent in combining and integrating the two companies
       and the potential distraction to management caused by a transaction of
       this magnitude;

     - the uncertainty with respect to timing and price of a sale of Conestoga's
       wireless operations;

     - the terms of the merger agreement restricting the conduct of business by
       D&E Communications prior to the consummation of the merger to conduct
       that is in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice as well
       as various other operational restrictions on D&E Communications prior to
       the consummation of the merger;

     - the potentially increased financial leverage of D&E Communications as a
       consequence of the consummation of the merger; and

     - the risk that the benefits sought from the merger might not be fully
       achieved.

     The D&E Communications board of directors believed and continues to believe
that the potential benefits anticipated to result from the merger greatly
outweigh the risks relating to the merger.

     This discussion of the factors considered by the D&E Communications board
of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. Because of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the D&E
Communications board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its conclusions. In addition, individual directors may
have given different weights to different factors.

     FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE D&E COMMUNICATIONS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
HAS DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF, D&E COMMUNICATIONS AND D&E COMMUNICATIONS SHAREHOLDERS.
ACCORDINGLY, THE D&E COMMUNICATIONS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT D&E
COMMUNICATIONS SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ISSUANCE OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS COMMON
STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

OPINION OF CONESTOGA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The Conestoga board of directors retained Legg Mason to act as Conestoga's
financial advisor in connection with the matters previously described, including
to give its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration to be received by the shareholders of Conestoga.

     On November 19, 2001 Legg Mason delivered its written opinion, dated
November 19, 2001, to the Conestoga board of directors that, as of the date of
the opinion and based on and subject to the matters stated in the opinion, the
merger consideration to be received by the shareholders of Conestoga is fair
from a financial point of view to such holders. Legg Mason also presented to the
Conestoga board of directors the analyses described below.

     The Legg Mason opinion was prepared for use by the Conestoga board of
directors and was directed only to the fairness from a financial point of view,
as of the date thereof, of the merger consideration to be received by the
shareholders of Conestoga. The Legg Mason opinion does not address the relative
merits of the merger as contrasted with any other business strategies considered
by the Conestoga board of directors, nor does it express any opinion as to the
decision of the Conestoga board of directors to proceed with the merger
agreement. The Legg Mason opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote on the merger or the form of
consideration any shareholder should request to receive in such merger. In
furnishing its opinion, Legg Mason did not admit that it is an expert within the
meaning of the term "expert" as used in the Securities Act nor did it admit that
its opinion serves as a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities
Act.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE LEGG MASON OPINION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX B TO
THIS PROXY STATEMENT/ PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS DOCUMENT BY
REFERENCE. THE SUMMARY OF LEGG MASON'S OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT
OF THE OPINION. SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS
ENTIRETY FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE, OTHER
MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITS OF THE REVIEW BY LEGG MASON IN CONNECTION WITH
SUCH OPINION.

     Conestoga selected Legg Mason as its financial advisor because it is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in
the communications industry and is familiar with Conestoga and its business.
Legg Mason has in the past performed other financial advisory services for
Conestoga and has received customary compensation. As part of its investment
banking business, Legg Mason is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses
and securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales
and distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of Legg
Mason's business, Legg Mason may make a market in the equity securities of
Conestoga and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.

     In arriving at its opinion, Legg Mason reviewed the merger agreement and
also reviewed financial and other information that was publicly available or
furnished to Legg Mason by Conestoga or D&E Communications management, including
information and financial projections provided during discussions with
management of Conestoga and D&E Communications. In addition, Legg Mason compared
financial data of Conestoga and D&E Communications with various other companies
whose securities are traded in public markets. Legg Mason reviewed prices and
premiums paid in other business combinations and conducted other financial
studies, analyses and investigations, as Legg Mason deemed appropriate for
purposes of rendering its opinion.

     In rendering its opinion, Legg Mason relied upon and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was
available from public sources, that was provided to Legg Mason

by Conestoga or D&E Communications or that was otherwise reviewed by Legg Mason
and assumed that neither Conestoga nor D&E Communications is aware of any other
information that might be material to Legg Mason's analysis or opinion. With
respect to financial projections, Legg Mason relied on representations that they
were reasonably prepared on the basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the managements of the respective companies as to the
future operating and financial performance of such companies. Actual results may
differ materially from the projections, and Legg Mason assumed no responsibility
for the correctness of the projections. Legg Mason did not assume any
responsibility for making any independent evaluation of any assets or
liabilities or for making any independent verification of any of the information
reviewed by Legg Mason. Legg Mason relied as to certain legal matters on advice
of counsel to Conestoga.

     The Legg Mason opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, financial
and other conditions as they existed on, and on the information made available
to Legg Mason as of, the date of the Legg Mason opinion. Although subsequent
developments may have affected or in the future may affect the Legg Mason
opinion, Legg Mason is under no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion.

     In preparing its opinion, Legg Mason conducted three principal analyses:
(1) a comparison of Conestoga with publicly traded companies comparable to
Conestoga, (2) a comparison of the proposed merger with comparable merger and
acquisition transactions involving rural local exchange companies comparable to
Conestoga, and (3) an analysis of the present value of future cash flows from
Conestoga's financial projections. The principal benchmarks for comparing
valuations of companies and acquisitions in the rural local exchange carrier
sector are enterprise value as a multiple of access lines and EBITDA. For
purposes of Legg Mason's analysis, Legg Mason defined enterprise value as the
market value of fully-diluted common equity plus the book value of long-term
debt and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus
cash, the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the
value of certain other assets and investments. "EBITDA" is net income before
interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and
extraordinary items.

     No company or transaction used in any comparable analysis as a comparison
is identical to Conestoga or the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results
is not mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and trading value of the comparable
companies or company to which they are being compared. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to partial
analyses or summary description. Legg Mason believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the
factors considered by it, without considering all factors and analyses, would
create a misleading view of the processes underlying its opinion. In view of the
wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
fairness of the consideration to be paid in the transaction, Legg Mason did not
find it practicable to assign relative weights to the factors considered in
reaching its opinion.

     The following is a summary of the analyses performed by Legg Mason in
connection with the preparation of the Legg Mason opinion.

     Public Comparables Analysis.  Legg Mason analyzed selected current and
historical operating information and valuation data for certain publicly traded
rural local exchange carriers that Legg Mason deemed comparable to Conestoga.
Particular emphasis was placed on rural local exchange carriers of similar size
with similar sources of revenues, particularly wireless and competitive local
exchange carrier revenues. These companies included Alaska Communications
Systems Group, Inc., CT Communications, Inc., D&E Communications, HickoryTech
Corporation and North Pittsburgh Systems, Inc.

     Legg Mason divided the enterprise value of each of the comparable companies
by the company's EBITDA for the most recently reported trailing twelve month
period and by the number of access lines. The result of this analysis was a
range of trailing EBITDA multiples and a range of access line multiples for
companies comparable to Conestoga. Legg Mason then multiplied the trailing
EBITDA and number of access lines of Conestoga by these multiples to derive a
range of estimated enterprise values of Conestoga. Based on the above analysis,
Legg Mason derived an implied enterprise value reference range (i) of $2,442 to
$5,392 per access line, resulting in an implied enterprise value for Conestoga
of $247,000,000 to $545,400,000, and

(ii) of 7.1x to 11.5x trailing EBITDA, resulting in an implied enterprise value
for Conestoga of $195,800,000 to $317,200,000. The corresponding implied value
per Conestoga share was approximately (i) $21.58 to $57.35 per share based on
the access line multiples, and (ii) $15.44 to $29.99 per share based on the
trailing EBITDA multiples.

     Comparable Acquisitions Analysis.  Legg Mason reviewed 13 selected control
acquisitions or proposed control acquisitions involving rural local exchange
carriers that Legg Mason deemed to be comparable to Conestoga. For each of these
acquisitions, Legg Mason divided the enterprise value of the target implied in
the acquisition by the trailing EDITDA and number of access lines of the target.
The result of this analysis was a range of trailing EBITDA multiples and a range
of access line multiples for control acquisitions of companies comparable to
Conestoga. Legg Mason then multiplied the trailing EDITDA and number of access
lines of Conestoga by these multiples to derive a range of estimated enterprise
values of Conestoga. Based on the above analysis, Legg Mason derived an implied
enterprise value reference range (i) of $3,167 to $6,388 per access line,
resulting in an implied enterprise value for Conestoga of $320,300,000 to
$646,100,000, and (ii) of 8.1x to 20.6x trailing EBITDA, resulting in an implied
enterprise value for Conestoga of $223,400,000 to $568,200,000. The
corresponding implied value per Conestoga share was approximately (i) $30.36 to
$69.42 per share based on the access line multiples, and (ii) $18.75 to $60.08
per share based on the trailing EBITDA multiples.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Legg Mason performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of Conestoga for the period commencing October 1, 2001 and ending
December 31, 2009 using Conestoga's projections and assumptions. The discounted
cash flow analysis estimated the value of Conestoga by projecting Conestoga's
unlevered future free cash flows and determining the present value of these cash
flows based on a discount rate. Legg Mason selected an appropriate range of
discount rates based on an estimate of Conestoga's cost of equity capital. The
sum of these discounted cash flows was then added to Conestoga's discounted
estimated terminal value to determine a total enterprise value for Conestoga.
The projected future cash flows were discounted using a discount rate ranging
from 10.5% to 12.5%. Conestoga's terminal value was estimated by multiplying its
projected trailing EDITDA in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009 by
multiples ranging from 7.5x to 8.5x. From this analysis, Legg Mason derived a
reference range for Conestoga's enterprise value of $275,300,000 to
$346,600,000. The corresponding implied value per Conestoga share was
approximately $24.97 to $33.52 per share.

Conclusion

     Based on the aggregate merger consideration of approximately $275,300,000
to be paid to Conestoga shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the
assumption of net indebtedness of Conestoga ($67,000,000 as of the execution of
the merger agreement), the merger agreement implies an enterprise value of the
company of $342,300,000. The corresponding equity value per Conestoga share is
$33.00. On the basis of the analyses described above Legg Mason concluded that
the consideration to be received by the shareholders of Conestoga is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders.

Engagement of Legg Mason

     Conestoga has paid Legg Mason fees of $450,000, and has agreed to pay Legg
Mason a percentage-based transaction fee contingent upon the successful
consummation of the merger, against which the $450,000 previously paid will be
credited. Pursuant to the engagement letter, the total payments to Legg Mason,
excluding fees and expenses, in connection with the consummation of the merger
will be approximately $3,200,000. In addition, Conestoga agreed to reimburse
Legg Mason for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to its engagement,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, whether or not the merger
is consummated. Conestoga has also agreed to indemnify Legg Mason and specified
related persons against specific liabilities relating to or arising out of its
engagement.

OPINION OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS' FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated May 4, 2001, and amended November
19, 2001, D&E Communications retained Jefferies & Company, Inc. to act as its
financial advisor to explore various strategic alternatives and potential
transactions. As part of its activities as financial advisor to D&E
Communications, Jefferies rendered its written opinion as to whether the merger
is fair, from a financial point of view, to D&E Communications. At the November
19, 2001 meeting of D&E Communications' board of directors, Jefferies presented
a summary of its analysis and a preliminary oral opinion, which was confirmed on
November 21, 2001 telephonically to the Special Transaction Committee of the
board of directors. On November 21, 2001, Jefferies delivered its written
opinion to the effect that the merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to D&E Communications.

     As part of its investment banking business, Jefferies is regularly engaged
in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers,
acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Jefferies has in the past performed and continues to perform other financial
advisory services for D&E Communications for which Jefferies has received
customary compensation. In the ordinary course of Jefferies' business, Jefferies
may make a market in the equity securities of Conestoga and D&E Communications
and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.

     THE FULL TEXT OF JEFFERIES' OPINION DESCRIBES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
SCOPE OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY JEFFERIES IN RENDERING ITS OPINION. THE
OPINION IS ATTACHED TO THIS DOCUMENT AS APPENDIX C AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS
DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. THE OPINION SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.
CONSIDERING ANY PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS OR THE FACTORS CONSIDERED, WITHOUT
CONSIDERING ALL ANALYSES AND FACTORS, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE
VIEW OF THE PROCESS UNDERLYING THE CONCLUSIONS EXPRESSED IN JEFFERIES' OPINION.
JEFFERIES' OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE D&E COMMUNICATIONS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, TO
D&E COMMUNICATIONS AS OF THE DATE OF THE OPINION. THE OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS
ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY
PERSON AS TO HOW TO VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF JEFFERIES'
OPINION DESCRIBED IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/ PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     In conducting its analysis and rendering its opinion to the board of
directors of D&E Communications described herein, Jefferies considered such
financial and other factors as it deemed appropriate under the circumstances,
including:

     - the terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement and the
       other agreements describing the merger;

     - the historical and current financial condition and results of operations
       of D&E Communications and Conestoga, including as set forth in certain
       public filings of D&E Communications and Conestoga;

     - certain non-public financial and non-financial information prepared by
       D&E Communications and Conestoga provided to Jefferies for its analysis;

     - published information regarding the financial performance and operating
       characteristics of a selected group of companies that Jefferies deemed
       comparable to Conestoga;

     - the business prospects of D&E Communications considering its current
       capital structure and after giving effect to the merger;

     - the financial and operating effect to D&E Communications of a sale of
       Conestoga's wireless personal communication services business after
       giving effect to the merger;

     - the historical and current market price of D&E Communications' and
       Conestoga's common stock;

     - publicly available industry data Jefferies considered relevant to its
       inquiry;

     - the terms, to the extent publicly available, of telecommunications
       transactions that Jefferies believed to be comparable to the merger;

     - the value of certain intangible benefits that may accrue to D&E
       Communications as a result of the merger;

     - the financing alternatives (other than the merger) currently available to
       D&E Communications and its current liquidity; and

     - market prices of D&E Communications' and Conestoga's common stock.

     In addition, Jefferies took into account general economic, monetary,
political and market conditions as well as its experience with similar
transactions and the valuation of similar securities. The opinion is based on
conditions as they existed on November 19, 2001. These conditions are subject to
rapid and unpredictable change, and any such change could have an impact on the
content of the opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation of the
merger over any alternative transactions which may be available to D&E
Communications and does not address D&E Communications' underlying business
decision to effect the merger.

     For purposes of rendering its opinion, Jefferies assumed that, in all
respects material to its analysis, the representations and warranties of D&E
Communications and Conestoga contained in the merger agreement are true and
correct, D&E Communications and Conestoga will each perform all of the covenants
and agreements to be performed by each of them under the merger agreement, and
all conditions to the obligations of D&E Communications to consummate the merger
will be satisfied without any waiver thereof.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Jefferies in connection with rendering its oral opinion to the D&E
Communications board of directors and the Special Transactions Committee of the
Board of Directors, and its written opinion letter dated November 21, 2001. The
market price information used by Jefferies in its analyses was as of November
20, 2001.

     Comparable Companies Analysis.  Jefferies reviewed and compared financial,
operating and stock market information of Conestoga with that of other publicly
traded companies in the telecommunications industry that Jefferies believed
shared some similar characteristics with Conestoga. This financial data was
adjusted to account for unusual events at those companies that may have skewed
their results. The adjusted data reported as of September 30, 2001 was then used
to compare the value of those companies to that of Conestoga. Jefferies
multiplied the number of Conestoga shares outstanding by the $33.00 acquisition
price, then added its total debt and subtracted its cash on hand to arrive at a
total value for Conestoga as an ongoing enterprise (total enterprise value). A
similar analysis was performed on each of the other companies Jefferies selected
as comparable companies using their closing share prices as of November 20,
2001.

     The first comparison method Jefferies used was to calculate the
relationship between each comparable companies total value and the cash flow it
generated during the previous twelve months. The comparison was made by
determining what number each company's cash flow should be multiplied by to
arrive at its total value. The cash flow figure used for each company did not
include any earnings from interest, the payment of taxes, or any non-cash
accounting losses such as depreciation or amortization. Jefferies selected the
following six companies, which it determined were the most comparable to
Conestoga: Alaska Communications Systems, Inc., CT Communications, Inc., Hickory
Tech Corporation, North Pittsburgh Systems, Inc., SureWest Communications, Inc.
and Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc. The cash flow multiple for these
companies ranged from 6.5 to 18.7, and the median of the range was 10.1.

     Another method of comparison Jefferies used was to compare each company's
total value with the number of customer phone lines (access lines) it services.
By dividing what the total number of customer phone lines each company serves by
the company's total value, Jefferies established a value per customer phone line
for each company. The value per customer phone line for the same six companies
used above ranged from $2,265 to $6,079, and the median of the range was $3,398.

     Jefferies then multiplied the median cash flow multiple by Conestoga's
previous twelve months cash flow and multiplied the median customer phone line
value by the number of Conestoga's customer phone lines to arrive at a range of
implied total values of Conestoga. Jefferies then took the implied total values
of Conestoga and subtracted total debt and added cash on hand to arrive at a
range of equity values. By dividing the equity values by the total number of
shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding Jefferies arrived at a range of

implied equity values per share of Conestoga common stock of $26.00 to $33.41.
Jefferies noted that the equity consideration in the merger agreement as of
November 21, 2001 was $33.00 per share, assuming D&E Communications common stock
was trading within the collar of $13.00 to $23.00. This comparable companies
analysis does not reflect a control premium adjustment to account for the
strategic value of owning all of the common stock of Conestoga.

     No company utilized in the comparable companies analysis is identical to
Conestoga. In evaluating the comparable companies group, Jefferies made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Conestoga. These other matters include the impact of
competition on the business of Conestoga and the industry generally, industry
growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition
and prospects of Conestoga or in the industry or financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in
itself a meaningful method of using comparable companies data.

     Comparable Transaction Analysis.  Jefferies reviewed 11 transactions
involving the change of control of rural local exchange carriers that Jefferies
deemed to be comparable to the proposed acquisition of Conestoga by D&E
Communications. In examining these acquisitions, Jefferies compiled publicly
available information about the value paid by the acquiring entity in each
transaction. Jefferies then compared the value paid in each case to the cash
flow produced by the target for the twelve months before it was acquired. This
resulted in a cash flow multiple for each company. As in the comparable
companies analysis, the cash flow figure used for each company did not include
any earnings from interest, the payment of taxes, or any noncash accounting
losses such as depreciation or amortization. The cash flow multiple for the
targets in the comparable transactions ranged from 9.5 to 20.3 and the median
was 11.2.

     Jefferies also compared the total number of customer phone lines (access
lines) of each target in the 11 comparable acquisitions with the value paid for
the target in each transaction. The range of values paid per customer phone line
was from $3,318 to $6,722, with the median at $4,312.

     Jefferies then multiplied the median cash flow multiple by Conestoga's
previous twelve months cash flow and multiplied the median customer phone line
value by the number of Conestoga's customer phone lines to arrive at a range of
implied total values of Conestoga. Jefferies then took the implied total values
of Conestoga and subtracted total debt and added cash on hand to arrive at a
range of equity values. By dividing the equity values by total number of shares
of Conestoga common stock outstanding Jefferies arrived at a range of implied
equity values per share of Conestoga common stock of $29.57 to $44.57. Jefferies
noted that the equity consideration in the merger agreement as of November 21,
2001 was $33.00 per share, assuming D&E Communications common stock was trading
within the collar of $13.00 to $23.00.

     Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis.  Jefferies analyzed operational and financial
information for each of Conestoga's substantial businesses to arrive at an
equity valuation for the entire Conestoga business. The valuations for each of
Conestoga's incumbent local exchange carrier, wireless, and competitive local
exchange carrier/long distance business were implied from several different
methodologies, depending on the type of business, primarily based on multiples
from relevant preceding transactions.

     For the incumbent local exchange carrier business, Jefferies used a
valuation methodology based on publicly available information on divestitures by
incumbent local exchange carriers of their customer phone lines. These
divestitures do not take into consideration the value of back office operations.
Jefferies divided the value paid by the acquiring entity in 12 previous
completed or proposed transactions that they deemed to be comparable by the
number of customer phone lines divested to create a range of values per customer
phone line. Jefferies then multiplied the median value per customer phone line
of $3,077 by Conestoga's incumbent local exchange carrier customer phone lines
to create an implied total value for Conestoga's incumbent local exchange
carrier business.

     For the wireless business, Jefferies compiled publicly available
information about the value paid by acquiring entities in the most recent
federal communications commission wireless license auctions and in wireless
company control acquisitions. For the federal communications commission wireless
license auctions

Jefferies analyzed the value paid for wireless licenses in 11 markets in
Pennsylvania that Jefferies deemed comparable to the markets that Conestoga's
wireless business operates in. Jefferies then calculated the value paid per
megahertz per person covered by the license by dividing the price paid for the
license by its covered population and then dividing by the number of megahertz
within in the market. The transaction value per megahertz per person calculated
in the federal communications commission wireless license auction comparables
was multiplied by Conestoga's megahertz and covered population to arrive at an
implied total value for Conestoga's wireless operations. For the wireless
company control acquisitions Jefferies analyzed 11 completed or proposed
transactions that they deemed comparable and divided the value paid by the
acquiring entity by the target's total customers and licensed population to
create two ranges of multiples. These multiples were then applied to Conestoga's
wireless customers and wireless licensed population to create an implied range
of total values for Conestoga's wireless operations.

     For the competitive local exchange carrier/long distance segment, Jefferies
compared financial and operating information of Conestoga's competitive local
exchange carrier/long distance business provided by Conestoga management with
that of similar completed or proposed transactions. This was done by dividing
the price paid for each company by the company's last twelve month revenues and
dividing the value paid for each company by the value of the company's property,
plant and equipment. Jefferies determined the median multiples of value paid to
last twelve month revenue and to property, plant and equipment, which were 3.8
and 1.5 respectively. The resulting multiples were applied to Conestoga's local
exchange carrier/long distance segment revenue and property, plant and equipment
information to determine the total value of Conestoga's local exchange
carrier/long distance business.

     Jefferies took the resulting range of values for each of Conestoga's
incumbent local exchange carrier, wireless, and competitive local exchange
carrier/long distance businesses and added them together to reach a range of
total values for Conestoga as a whole. Jefferies then subtracted total debt and
added cash to reach a range of equity values. Jefferies then divided by
Conestoga's total number of shares of common stock to arrive at the range of
implied equity values per share of Conestoga common stock of $35.85 to $48.63.
Jefferies noted that the equity consideration in the merger agreement as of
November 21, 2001 was $33.00 per share, assuming D&E Communications common stock
was trading within the collar.

     Conclusion.  Based on the aggregate merger consideration of approximately
$273,314,910 representing $33.00 per share to be paid to Conestoga shareholders
pursuant to the merger agreement and the net debt of Conestoga $67,005,651 as of
the execution of the merger agreement to be assumed by D&E Communications, the
merger agreement implies a total value of Conestoga of $350,320,561, taking into
account the termination fee paid to NTELOS, Inc. On the basis of the analyses
described above, Jefferies concluded that the merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to D&E Communications.

     Jefferies may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight
than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Jefferies' view of the actual value of D&E Communications or Conestoga.

     In performing its analyses, Jefferies made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Conestoga or D&E
Communications. Any such assumptions or estimates are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were
prepared solely as part of Jefferies' analysis of the fairness to D&E
Communications, from a financial point of view, of the merger. The analyses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which D&E
Communications common stock or Conestoga common stock might actually trade. The
consideration and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through
arm's-length negotiations between D&E Communications and Conestoga and were
approved by the D&E Communications board of directors. Jefferies provided advice
to D&E Communications during such negotiations. However, Jefferies did not
recommend any specific consideration to D&E Communications or that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

     Pursuant to the amended engagement letter, D&E Communications agreed to pay
Jefferies a fee of $250,000 upon delivery of the fairness opinion, which will be
credited toward the success fee payable to Jefferies upon consummation of the
merger. The total success fee will be based on a percentage of the transaction
value of the proposed merger. Including the payment for the fairness opinion,
the success fee is estimated to be $3.4 million. D&E Communications also agreed
to reimburse Jefferies for its expenses incurred in connection with the
engagement, and to indemnify Jefferies and related parties against certain
liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal
securities laws, arising out of Jefferies' engagement. D&E Communications has
also retained, or agreed to retain Jefferies to act as its financial advisor or
placement agent with respect to certain future transactions, and has agreed to
pay Jefferies a fee upon closing of any such transaction. In the past, Jefferies
has provided financial advisory services to D&E Communications and has received
or anticipates receiving aggregate fees of approximately $2.8 million upon the
closings of the transactions from D&E Communications for the rendering of
financial advisory services.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

D&E Communications Management

     D&E Communications maintains a long term incentive plan for the benefit of
its employees. Under the plan, certain employees of D&E Communications have been
granted performance restricted shares and cash incentive awards that permit the
employees to receive restricted shares of common stock of D&E Communications and
cash payments upon the achievement of certain performance goals. The restricted
shares earned by each employee vest according to a vesting schedule determined
by D&E Communications, which generally coincides with the period during which
the applicable performance goal is achieved.

     The completion of the merger will constitute a change of control for
purposes of D&E Communications' long term incentive plan. Upon a change of
control, all performance restricted shares and cash incentive awards granted
under the plan are deemed to have been earned in full and all restricted shares
granted under the plan due to the achievement of performance goals become fully
vested. A total of 134,052 restricted shares and approximately $1,026,000 in
cash incentive awards were granted under the plan to employees of D&E
Communications since the plan's inception in 1999. Of those employees, Robert M.
Lauman, Thomas E. Morell, W. Garth Sprecher, Anne B. Sweigart, and G. William
Ruhl, all executive officers of D&E Communications, each received performance
restricted share awards of 12,000 shares and cash incentive awards of $89,200
during the same period.

Employment Agreements

     Conestoga Employment Agreements.  Conestoga has employment agreements with
7 of its employees, which agreements provide for certain severance benefits in
the event of a voluntary or involuntary termination of employment after a change
of control of Conestoga and during the term of the applicable agreement. Because
completion of the merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of
those agreements, the severance benefits provided under those agreements will
become payable upon the employee's termination of employment at any time
following the completion of the merger and during the term of the applicable
agreement. The severance benefits under each of these employment agreements,
consist of the payment of annual salary, as in effect at the time of
termination, for a period of three, two or one and one-half years from the
termination date in periodic payments.

     If the merger is completed, the estimated severance payment that will be
payable under employment agreements with executive officers of Conestoga or a
subsidiary of Conestoga, upon a termination of employment based on certain
assumptions and currently available information, will be: $514,920 for Donald R.
Breitenstein; $405,000 for Harrison H. Clement; and $363,000 for Thomas C. Keim.
In connection with their entry into new employment agreements with D&E
Communications following the merger as described below, Albert H. Kramer, Stuart
L. Kirkwood and Joseph J. Laffey has each agreed to waive all rights under his
existing employment agreement with Conestoga, including any right to severance
payments.

     New D&E Communications Employment Agreements.  Each of Messrs. Kramer,
Kirkwood and Laffey intend to enter into employment agreements with D&E
Communications effective on the closing of the

merger. In addition to their waiver of rights and benefits under their existing
Conestoga employment agreements, each of Messrs. Kramer, Kirkwood and Laffey has
agreed, except with respect to his receipt of a change of control bonus as
described below, to release D&E Communications and Conestoga from all claims
arising out of his employment with Conestoga or otherwise.

     Under his new employment agreement with D&E Communications, Mr. Kramer
would serve as Senior Vice President of D&E Communications for an initial term
of two years, which term would automatically extend an additional year as of the
end of each year unless either party provided 60 days' prior written notice to
the other not to extend the term. Mr. Kramer would receive a base salary of
$175,000 per year during the term of the agreement and would be eligible to
receive a short term incentive amount based on an annual incentive target,
subject to achieving various objectives based on the performance of D&E
Communications and the approval of the D&E Communications board of directors or
the appropriate committee thereof. Mr. Kramer would be entitled to participate
in the employee benefit plans that are made available to other comparable
executives of D&E Communications. Additionally, Mr. Kramer would receive an
option grant for 25,000 shares under the D&E Communications' long-term
stock-based incentive compensation program and would also be eligible to receive
additional D&E Communications stock options, subject to D&E Communications'
performance and approval of the D&E Communications compensation committee. At
the end of his initial two-year employment term, Mr. Kramer would be entitled to
receive a one-time retention bonus of $120,000. If Mr. Kramer's employment were
terminated without cause or as a result of his death or disability or if he were
to resign with good reason (as defined in the employment agreement) during the
employment term Mr. Kramer or his beneficiary would be entitled to his base
salary for the remaining term and various incentive payments. Additionally, if
Mr. Kramer's employment were terminated without cause or if he were to resign
with good reason during the initial two-year employment term, Mr. Kramer would
be entitled to continued health care for himself and his dependents for the
remainder of the initial two-year employment term. If D&E Communications were to
undergo a change of control during the employment term and Mr. Kramer were
terminated without cause or resigned with good reason during the 12 months
following the change of control or if he terminated employment for any reason
within the 30 day period beginning on the one year anniversary of the change of
control, he would be entitled to receive the greater of (i) his base salary and
various incentive payments for the remaining term or (ii) 2 years' compensation
as well as continued health care for himself and his dependents for a period of
two years. The agreement also contains restrictive covenants that, during his
employment and for two years after the termination of his employment, would
prevent Mr. Kramer from competing with D&E Communications.

     Under their new employment agreements with D&E Communications, Messrs.
Kirkwood and Laffey would each serve as a Vice President of D&E Communications
for a period of two years following the merger. Messrs. Kirkwood and Laffey
would each receive a base salary of $150,000 and $141,000 respectively per year
during the term of the agreement and would be eligible to receive a short term
incentive amount based on an annual incentive target, subject to achieving
various objectives based on the performance of D&E Communications and the
approval of the board or the appropriate committee thereof. Each would also be
entitled to participate in the employee benefit plans that are made available to
other comparable executives of D&E Communications. Additionally, Messrs.
Kirkwood and Laffey would each receive an option grant for 17,000 and 15,000
shares, respectively, under the D&E Communications' long-term stock-based
incentive compensation program and would also be eligible to receive additional
D&E Communications stock options, subject to D&E Communications' performance and
compensation committee approval. At the end of the employment term, Messrs.
Kirkwood and Laffey would each be entitled to receive a one-time retention bonus
of $75,000. Before the expiration of the two-year employment term, if Messrs.
Kirkwood or Laffey were terminated without cause or as a result of death or
disability or if he were to resign with good reason, each of Messrs. Kirkwood
and Laffey or his beneficiary would be entitled to his base salary for the
remaining term, as well as various incentive payments. If D&E Communications
were to undergo a change of control during the employment term and Messrs.
Kirkwood or Laffey were terminated without cause or resigned with good reason
during the 12 months following the change of control, or terminated employment
for any reason within the 30 day period beginning on the one year anniversary of
the change of control he would be entitled to receive the greater of (i) his
base salary and various incentive payments for the remaining term or (ii) two
year's compensation as well as continued health care for himself and his
dependents for a period of two years.

The agreements also contain restrictive covenants that, during their employment
and for two years after the termination of their employment, would prevent
Messrs. Kirkwood and Laffey from competing with D&E Communications.

     Acceleration of Vesting of Stock Options.  Conestoga has issued stock
options to certain officers and employees under Conestoga's stock option and
equity incentive plans. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all options to
acquire shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, whether or not then exercisable, will be converted
into options of D&E Communications common stock in amounts and at exercise
prices as determined in the merger agreement. The terms of each option will
otherwise remain subject to the terms of the applicable option plan and
agreements as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
All stock options granted by Conestoga will, at the discretion of the optionees,
become immediately vested and exercisable at the effective time of the merger.
The following table sets forth for each of Messrs. Breitenstein, Clement, Keim,
Laffey and Kramer information concerning the number of options that are subject
to such accelerated vesting, the date such options would vest in the absence of
the merger and the exercise price of such options:

     Change in Control Plan.  As part of the process of its evaluation of
Conestoga's strategic alternatives, the Conestoga board of directors by
resolution passed in July 2001, established a bonus pool providing bonuses for
various management employees in the event the process resulted in a change of
control of Conestoga. The bonus pool was established in lieu of the grant of
stock options in accordance with the Conestoga board of directors' regular
practice and in recognition of the contributions of management in the strategic
evaluation process. A total of 18 employees were granted awards in the pool
aggregating $1,313,750, with the amount of individual awards based on level of
responsibility and participation in the process. The pool will be allocated
among certain executive officers as follows: $122,000 for Donald R.
Breitenstein; $122,000 for Harrison Clement, Jr.; $242,500 for Albert H. Kramer;
$122,000 for Thomas C. Keim; and $122,000 for Joseph L. Laffey. In order to
receive an award, a participating employee must remain employed with Conestoga
until a change of control occurs.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion, which is based on an opinion Morgan, Lewis &
Bockius LLP has delivered to D&E Communications and Conestoga, is a summary of
the material federal income tax consequences of the merger to Conestoga
shareholders who hold their shares of Conestoga common stock as capital assets.
This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue
Code, and judicial and administrative decisions currently in effect. All of
these authorities are subject to retroactive or prospective change and to
possibly differing interpretations. This discussion does not address the federal
income tax consequences applicable to holders of Conestoga common stock who are
subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, such as foreign
holders, holders who acquired their stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who are dealers in
securities, banks, insurance companies or tax exempt organizations, and holders
who hold their shares of Conestoga common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or
other risk reduction transaction. In addition, this discussion does not address
the tax consequences of the merger under applicable foreign, state or local tax
laws.

     SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
TAX LAWS.

     Summary.  The federal income tax consequences resulting from the merger
will differ depending on whether the forward merger structure or the reverse
merger structure is used.

     If the forward merger structure is applicable, it will be a condition to
their obligations to effect the merger that each of D&E Communications and
Conestoga receive an opinion from tax counsel, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP,
substantially to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The federal income tax
consequences of the forward merger structure are discussed below under the
heading "Tax Consequences of the Forward Merger Structure" on page   .

     If the reverse merger structure is applicable, the merger will not
constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Instead, it will be treated as a sale of Conestoga common stock fully taxable to
the Conestoga shareholders as discussed below under the heading "Tax
Consequences of the Reverse Merger Structure" on pages 51 through 52.

     The use of the forward or reverse merger structure will not be known until
the closing of the merger. As a result, Conestoga shareholders will not know the
tax consequences to them of the merger at the time they vote on it.

     The forward structure will be used if, based on the closing price of D&E
Communications common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the closing
date, the value of the D&E Communications common stock issued to Conestoga
shareholders in the merger is greater than or equal to 40% of the value of the
total consideration received by Conestoga shareholders in the merger. If, based
on the closing price of D&E Communications common stock on such day, the value
of the D&E Communications common stock issued to Conestoga shareholders in the
merger is less than 40% of the value of the total consideration received by
Conestoga shareholders in the merger (including, for this purpose, cash received
by holders of Conestoga's series A preferred stock in connection with the
redemption of such preferred stock as described below under the heading "The
Merger -- Conversion of Conestoga's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock" on
page 53), the reverse merger structure will be used.

     The purpose of using the reverse merger structure is to avoid the
substantial corporate level tax that would result if the merger were to be
structured as a forward merger and were to fail to satisfy the requirements for
a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. One
of the requirements that must be satisfied in order for the merger to qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is the
continuity of interest requirement.

     This requirement will be satisfied if the Conestoga shareholders exchange a
substantial portion of their proprietary interests in Conestoga for proprietary
interests in D&E Communications. The Internal Revenue Service takes the position
for advance ruling purposes that the continuity of interest requirement is
satisfied in a reorganization if the value of the acquiring corporation's stock
received in the reorganization by the acquired corporation's shareholders equals
or exceeds 50% of the total consideration paid for the stock of the acquired
corporation in the reorganization. However, these guidelines only describe the
circumstances in which the Internal Revenue Service will issue a favorable
ruling in advance of the completion of a transaction. They are not a statement
of the substantive law with regard to the continuity of interest requirement.
The case law is less restrictive than the ruling guidelines of the Internal
Revenue Service in this area and, in one early case, the Supreme Court held that
the continuity requirement was satisfied where the shareholders of the acquired
company received stock of the acquiring company having a value of approximately
38% of the value of the formerly outstanding stock of the acquired company. D&E
Communications and Conestoga have thus been advised by tax counsel that the
continuity of interest requirement will be satisfied if at least 40% of the
consideration received by the Conestoga shareholders in connection with the
merger is comprised of D&E Communications common stock.

     The merger agreement contains a mechanism to ensure that the forward merger
structure is used only if the mix of stock and cash received by the Conestoga
shareholders is such that it satisfies the 40% continuity of interest threshold.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, the continuity of interest requirement will be
satisfied if on the closing date, the fair market value of the D&E
Communications common stock, as determined based on the closing price of D&E
Communications common stock at the end of the day before the closing date,
delivered in the merger is greater than or equal to 40% of the total
consideration delivered in the merger. Whether this requirement will be
satisfied depends on certain variables, including in particular the closing
price of D&E Communications common stock at the end of the day before the
closing date. Based on current information, if the price of D&E Communications
common stock on that date is at least approximately $10.60 (assuming (1)
8,287,669 shares of Conestoga common stock are outstanding, (2) all outstanding
shares of Conestoga preferred stock have converted into common stock, (3) 55% of
Conestoga shares of common stock are to be converted into cash consideration and
45% of such shares are to be converted into D&E Communications common stock and
(4) no cash in lieu of fractional shares is paid), the value of the D&E
Communications common stock delivered to the Conestoga shareholders in
connection with the merger will be at least 40% of the value of the total
consideration delivered to Conestoga shareholders in the merger. In that case,
the continuity of interest test will be satisfied and the merger will be
completed through the use of the forward merger structure and will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if
the price of D&E Communications common stock on that date declines below

approximately $10.60, the value of the D&E Communications common stock delivered
to the Conestoga shareholders in the merger will, based on the above
assumptions, be less than 40% of the total consideration delivered to Conestoga
shareholders in the merger. In this event, the continuity of interest
requirement will not be satisfied and the merger will be completed through the
use of the reverse merger structure and will not qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Because the value of the D&E
Communications common stock for purposes of the 40% test will be determined on
the closing date, we will not know at the time of the special shareholder
meetings whether the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, whether the forward merger
structure or the reverse merger structure will be used.

     Tax Consequences of the forward merger structure.  If the forward merger
structure is used, a condition to the consummation of the merger will be the
delivery by Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP of its opinion that the merger will
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The federal income tax consequences to a Conestoga shareholder of a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code will depend on
whether the shareholder receives solely D&E Communications common stock, solely
cash, or a combination of cash and D&E Communications common stock in the
merger. The tax opinion will represent counsel's best judgment as to the tax
treatment of the merger and as to the consequences of the merger to Conestoga
shareholders, but will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts. Additionally, the opinion will be based on certain factual
representations and statements by D&E Communications, Conestoga and D&E
Acquisition Corp. Any inaccuracy or change in the representations and any future
actions by D&E Communications or Conestoga contrary to the representations could
adversely affect the conclusions reached in the opinion and the tax discussion
set forth below.

     The receipt of solely D&E Communications common stock by a Conestoga
shareholder in exchange for Conestoga common stock under the forward merger
structure.  A Conestoga shareholder who exchanges all of the shares of Conestoga
common stock owned by the shareholder for shares of D&E Communications common
stock will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange, except for any gain
or loss attributable to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of D&E
Communications common stock. The aggregate tax basis of the shares of D&E
Communications common stock received by the shareholder in the exchange will be
the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Conestoga common stock surrendered in
the exchange. Also, the shareholder's holding period for the D&E Communications
common stock received in exchange for shares of Conestoga common stock will
include the period during which the shareholder held shares of Conestoga common
stock that were surrendered in the exchange.

     The receipt of a combination of cash and D&E Communications common stock by
a Conestoga shareholder in exchange for Conestoga common stock under the forward
merger structure.  A Conestoga shareholder who exchanges the shares of Conestoga
common stock owned by the shareholder for a combination of cash and shares of
D&E Communications common stock will not recognize any loss on the exchange.
However, the shareholder will recognize gain equal to the lesser of the amount
of cash received and the gain realized. The gain realized will be the excess of
the sum of the fair market value of D&E Communications common stock and the
amount of cash received in exchange for the shareholder's shares of Conestoga
common stock that were surrendered in the exchange over the shareholder's
adjusted tax basis in those shares. For this purpose, a Conestoga shareholder
must calculate gain or loss separately for each identifiable block of shares of
Conestoga common stock that is surrendered in the exchange, and the Conestoga
shareholder may not offset a loss recognized on one block of the shares against
gain recognized on another block of the shares.

     Any gain recognized by a Conestoga shareholder who receives a combination
of D&E Communications common stock and cash will generally be treated as capital
gain. However, if the receipt of the cash has "the effect of the distribution of
a dividend" for federal income tax purposes, any gain recognized by the
shareholder may be treated as ordinary dividend income. Any gain that is treated
as capital gain will be long-term capital gain if the holding period for shares
of Conestoga common stock that are surrendered in the exchange is greater than
one year as of the date of the exchange.

     For purposes of determining whether the cash received has the effect of a
distribution of a dividend for federal income tax purposes, a Conestoga
shareholder is treated as if the shareholder first exchanged all of the
shareholder's shares of Conestoga common stock solely for D&E Communications
common stock and then D&E Communications immediately redeemed a portion of the
D&E Communications common stock in exchange for the cash the shareholder
actually received. This is called a "deemed redemption."

     Under this analysis, in general, if the receipt of cash by the holder in
the deemed redemption results in a "substantially disproportionate" reduction in
the holder's voting stock interest in D&E Communications or is "not essentially
equivalent to a dividend," the receipt of the cash will not have the effect of
the distribution of a dividend.

     The deemed redemption will be "substantially disproportionate," and,
therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend with respect
to a Conestoga shareholder if the percentage of the outstanding D&E
Communications common stock that is actually and constructively owned by the
shareholder immediately after the deemed redemption is less than 80% of the
percentage of the outstanding D&E Communications common stock that is considered
to be actually and constructively owned by the shareholder immediately before
the deemed redemption. The deemed redemption will not be "essentially equivalent
to a dividend," and, therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a
dividend with respect to a Conestoga shareholder if it results in a "meaningful
reduction" in the shareholder's proportionate interest in D&E Communications. If
a shareholder that is considered to have a relatively minimal stock interest in
D&E Communications and no right to exercise control over corporate affairs
suffers a reduction in the shareholder's proportionate interest in D&E
Communications, the shareholder should be regarded as having suffered a
meaningful reduction of his or her interest in D&E Communications. For example,
the Internal Revenue Service has held in a published ruling that, in the case of
a less than 1% shareholder who does not have management control over the
corporation, any reduction in the shareholder's proportionate interest will
constitute a "meaningful reduction."

     In applying this deemed redemption analysis, certain attribution rules
apply in determining a Conestoga shareholder's ownership interest in D&E
Communications immediately after the merger, but before the deemed redemption,
and after the deemed redemption. Under those rules, a Conestoga shareholder is
deemed to own stock held by certain family members, estates and trusts of which
the shareholder is a beneficiary, a partnership in which the shareholder is a
partner, and a corporation in which the shareholder is a direct or indirect 50%
shareholder, as well as stock subject to options that are held by the
shareholder or the entities. Because these constructive ownership rules are
complex, each Conestoga shareholder who believes that he or she may be subject
to these rules should consult his or her tax advisor.

     The aggregate tax basis of the D&E Communications common stock received by
a Conestoga shareholder who exchanges his or her shares of Conestoga common
stock for a combination of D&E Communications common stock and cash will be the
same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Conestoga common stock
surrendered in the exchange, decreased by the amount of cash received, and
increased by the amount of gain recognized, including any portion of the gain
that is treated as a dividend. The holding period of the D&E Communications
common stock received will include the holding period of the shares of Conestoga
common stock surrendered in exchange therefor. If a Conestoga shareholder has
differing tax bases and/or holding periods with respect to the shareholder's
shares of Conestoga common stock that the shareholder surrenders in the
exchange, the shareholder should consult a tax advisor in order to identify the
particular tax bases and/or holding periods of the particular shares of D&E
Communications common stock received in the exchange.

     The receipt of cash by a Conestoga shareholder in exchange for Conestoga
common stock under the forward merger structure.  Currently, the state of the
law is unclear as to the analysis that must be applied in

determining the federal income tax consequences to a Conestoga shareholder who
exchanges all of the shares of Conestoga common stock owned by the shareholder
solely for cash. The shareholder may be treated as:

     - having sold his or her shares of Conestoga common stock in a taxable sale
       or exchange;

     - having received shares of D&E Communications common stock in the merger
       of Conestoga into D&E Communications and having had the shares redeemed
       by D&E Communications immediately after the merger; or

     - having had his or her shares of Conestoga common stock redeemed by
       Conestoga prior to the merger.

     However, in most circumstances, both the sales analysis and the redemption
analysis will yield the same tax result to the Conestoga shareholder.

     If the sales analysis is applied, the Conestoga shareholder will recognize
gain or loss, measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and
the adjusted tax basis of the Conestoga common stock surrendered in exchange for
the cash.

     If the redemption analysis is applied, the Conestoga shareholder will be
treated as having exchanged the Conestoga stock held by the shareholder for
cash, rather than having received a dividend distribution, if, after applying
the attribution rules discussed above, the redemption is:

     - in complete redemption of all of the Conestoga shareholder's stock in
       either D&E Communications or Conestoga, as the case may be;

     - a substantially disproportionate reduction in the holder's voting stock
       interest in either D&E Communications or Conestoga, as the case may be;
       or

     - not essentially equivalent to a dividend.

     If the redemption qualifies as an exchange, a Conestoga shareholder will
recognize any gain or loss realized on the exchange. If the redemption does not
qualify as an exchange, the cash received by the Conestoga shareholder will be
treated as a dividend distribution, and thus as ordinary income, to the extent
of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of the redeeming
corporation. Any excess will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the
Conestoga stock held by the shareholder. However, under those circumstances, the
Conestoga shareholder will not be permitted to recognize any loss.

     Given the unclear state of the law with respect to the exchange of
Conestoga stock solely for cash, Conestoga shareholders who will receive solely
cash are urged to consult their own tax advisors with regard to the receipt of
cash.

     Tax consequences of the reverse merger structure.  If the merger is
completed through the use of the reverse merger structure, the obligations of
D&E Communications and Conestoga to consummate the merger will not be
conditioned upon the issuance of an opinion by tax counsel, and the merger will
not constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Instead, it will be treated as a sale of Conestoga stock fully taxable to
the Conestoga shareholders. In this case, each Conestoga shareholder will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between:

     - the amount of cash plus the fair market value of the D&E Communications
       common stock received; and

     - the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Conestoga common
       stock surrendered in the exchange.

     In that event Conestoga shareholders who receive only D&E Communications
common stock in exchange for their Conestoga shares will need to obtain funds
from other sources to satisfy their tax liability in connection with the merger.
Even if the Conestoga shareholder receives a combination of cash and D&E
Communications common stock, the cash received may not be sufficient to satisfy
tax liabilities.

     Cash received in lieu of fractional shares.  A Conestoga shareholder who
receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of D&E Communications common stock
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference

between the amount of cash received and the portion of the adjusted tax basis of
the shareholder's shares of Conestoga common stock that are allocable to the
fractional interest. Such gain or loss will constitute capital gain or loss, and
will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the
shares was greater than one year as of the date of the exchange.

     Backup withholding.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, a Conestoga
shareholder may be subject, under certain circumstances, to backup withholding
at a 30.5% rate with respect to the amount of consideration received pursuant to
the merger unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a
correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and may be refunded or
credited against the holder's federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

     THE ABOVE DISCUSSION MAY NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SHAREHOLDERS
SUBJECT TO SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. SHAREHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     For purposes of preparing D&E Communications' consolidated financial
statements, D&E Communications will establish a new accounting basis for
Conestoga's assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, the merger
consideration and the costs of the merger. A final determination of asset and
liability values and required purchase accounting adjustments has not yet been
made. D&E Communications will determine the fair value of Conestoga's assets and
liabilities and will make appropriate purchase accounting adjustments upon
completion of that determination. However, for purposes of disclosing pro forma
information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, D&E Communications has
made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation, based upon
current estimates and assumptions, which is subject to revision upon
consummation of the merger.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents some transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and various waiting periods end or expire. D&E Communications has made all
required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The applicable waiting periods
expire on January 28, 2002. The requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino will be
satisfied if the merger is completed within one year from the termination of the
waiting period.

     Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the Federal
Communications Commission must consent to the transfer of control to D&E
Communications of Conestoga and of its Federal Communications Commission
licenses and authorizations prior to consummation of the merger. In so
consenting, the Federal Communications Commission must determine that D&E
Communications is qualified to control the licensee and its Federal
Communications Commission licenses and authorizations and that the transfer of
control is consistent with the public interest. D&E Communications and Conestoga
have filed all required applications for Federal Communications Commission
consent to the transfer of control of Conestoga and its Federal Communications
Commission licenses and authorizations.

     The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission must approve the change of
control of Conestoga's telephone operations. On December 27, 2001, Conestoga and
D&E Communications filed a Joint Application with the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission seeking approval of the transfer of control to D&E
Communications.

     Under the applicable cable television system franchise ordinance, the
Borough of State College, Pennsylvania must consent to the transfer of control
to D&E Communications of Conestoga's cable television franchise prior to
consummation of the merger.

     Conestoga is also requesting the approval of, or providing notice to, as
may be required by law, various state agencies due to Conestoga's operations as
an interexchange carrier.

     We are not aware of any other material governmental or regulatory approval
required for completion of the merger, other than compliance with the applicable
corporate law of Pennsylvania.

NO CONESTOGA SHAREHOLDER DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     The Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended in 2001, does
not grant shareholders of Conestoga the right to dissent from the merger and to
obtain payment of the "fair value" of their shares in the event D&E
Communications and Conestoga complete the merger.

CONVERSION OF CONESTOGA'S SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     As of September 30, 2001, 75,428 shares of Conestoga series A preferred
stock were outstanding. Under the merger agreement, a condition to D&E
Communications' obligation to close the transaction is that all shares of series
A preferred stock shall have been redeemed or converted into shares of Conestoga
common stock. Each share of series A preferred stock is currently convertible
into Conestoga common stock at a conversion price of $22.95. If the series A
preferred stock is converted into common stock prior to the closing of the
merger agreement, each share of common stock the holder receives upon conversion
of the series A preferred stock will be exchanged in the merger in accordance
with the exchange ratio.

     On December 28, 2001, Conestoga's board of directors voted to redeem all of
Conestoga's outstanding shares of preferred stock. The redemption terms of the
preferred stock require Conestoga to pay $66.30 plus approximately $0.64 in
respect of unpaid dividends for each preferred share redeemed. A notice of
redemption was sent to all preferred shareholders on January 7, 2002 informing
them that the redemption will take place on February 6, 2002 unless they
exercise their right to convert their preferred shares to Conestoga common
stock. Under the conversion terms of the preferred stock, preferred shareholders
may, during the redemption notice period, elect to convert their preferred
shares into shares of Conestoga common stock at the conversion price of $22.95
per share rather than have their preferred shares redeemed by Conestoga (i.e.,
each preferred share can be converted into 2.832 shares of Conestoga common
stock).

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW CONSEQUENCES; RESALE RESTRICTIONS

     All shares of D&E Communications common stock that will be distributed to
shareholders of Conestoga in the merger will be freely transferable, except for
restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applicable to persons
who are "affiliates" of Conestoga at the time of the Conestoga special meeting.
The shares received by affiliates of Conestoga may be resold by them only in
compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Shares of D&E Communications
common stock received by Conestoga shareholders who become affiliates of D&E
Communications may be sold by them only under the provisions of Rule 144 of the
Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. The merger
agreement requires Conestoga to cause each of its affiliates to execute a
written agreement to the effect that they will not sell or dispose of any of the
shares of D&E Communications common stock issued to them in the merger unless
the sale or disposition of such shares has been registered under the Securities
Act, is in conformity with Rule 145 or is otherwise permitted under the
Securities Act.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document and is
incorporated in this document by reference. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the merger agreement. You are urged to read the entire
merger agreement carefully because it, and not this document, is the legal
document that governs the merger.

THE MERGER

     Structure.  As a result of the merger, Conestoga will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of D&E Communications. The surviving corporation in the merger will
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania under the name "Conestoga Enterprises, Inc."

     The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation of the merger
may change. No such change will reduce the amount or change the form of
consideration to be delivered to Conestoga shareholders or materially impede or
delay the completion of the merger. The change in structure may, however, result
in a change in the tax consequences of the merger. See "Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences" on page 47.

     Effective Time.  The merger will become effective on the filing of articles
of merger relating to the merger with the Pennsylvania Department of State. We
expect to file the articles of merger as soon as practicable after the
shareholders of Conestoga have approved the merger agreement and the
shareholders of D&E Communications have approved the issuance of shares of D&E
Communications common stock in connection with the merger and all of the other
conditions listed in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived. We
anticipate that the effective time of the merger will occur in the second
quarter of 2002.

     Merger Consideration.  Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the
merger agreement, each Conestoga shareholder will have the option in the merger
consideration either (i) to have all of his or her Conestoga shares convert into
cash, (ii) to have all of his or her Conestoga shares convert into shares of D&E
Communications common stock or (iii) to have 55% of his or her Conestoga shares
convert into cash and to have 45% of his or her Conestoga shares convert into
D&E Communications common stock. Each Conestoga shareholder electing to receive
only cash will receive $33.00 for each share of Conestoga common stock. Each
Conestoga shareholder electing to receive only D&E Communications common stock
will receive, for each share of Conestoga common stock, a number of shares of
D&E Communications common stock determined by reference to an exchange ratio.
Each Conestoga shareholder electing to receive the merger consideration 55% in
cash and 45% in shares of D&E Communications common stock will receive, for each
share of Conestoga common stock, $18.15 in cash and a number of shares of D&E
Communications common stock determined by reference to an exchange ratio. See
"Shareholder Elections" on page 55. In certain circumstances, a shareholder's
election to receive the merger consideration may be adjusted to ensure that (i)
no more than 55% of the Conestoga common shares will be converted into cash, and
(ii) D&E Communications will not issue more than 9,467,068 shares of its common
stock in the merger. D&E Communications has structured the transaction so that
each shareholder electing to receive cash will receive a minimum of 55% of his
or her consideration in cash. See "Proration Adjustment" on pages 58 through 59.

PROCEDURES FOR SHAREHOLDER ELECTIONS

     All shareholder elections will be made on the election form that was mailed
to Conestoga shareholders along with this document. Conestoga will use its
reasonable best efforts to mail or otherwise make available an election form to
all persons who become holders of record of Conestoga common stock after the
date of the mailing of the election forms and prior to the election deadline. To
be effective, an election form must be returned, properly completed and
accompanied by the stock certificate(s) as to which the election is being made,
to the exchange agent no later than the date that is ten days after the
effective time of the merger. Promptly after the merger closes, D&E
Communications will issue a press release and send notice to Conestoga
shareholders regarding the exchange ratio and the election deadline. A record
holder that fails to submit an effective election form prior to the election
deadline will be deemed to have made an election to receive 55% in cash and 45%
in D&E Communications common stock. A record holder who fails to properly make
an election will receive a letter of transmittal after the effective time of the
merger with instructions for

surrendering the Conestoga stock certificates and receiving the merger
consideration. In the event that any stock certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to D&E Communications that the
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by D&E
Communications, the posting of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to the certificate, the
exchange agent will issue in exchange for the merger consideration that would
have been payable upon due surrender of Conestoga common stock represented by
the certificate. If the merger is terminated prior to the effective time, stock
certificates that have previously been delivered to the exchange agent will be
returned to the shareholders of record.

     Elections may be revoked or amended upon written notice to the exchange
agent prior to the election deadline.

SHAREHOLDER ELECTIONS

     Each Conestoga shareholder may use the election form which will be sent to
each Conestoga shareholder along with this document to indicate whether their
preference is to receive their merger consideration in cash or D&E
Communications common stock or a combination of cash and D&E Communications
common stock.

     Each Conestoga shareholder will receive for each share of Conestoga common
stock:

     - 100% of the merger consideration in cash;

     - 100% of the merger consideration in shares of common stock of D&E
       Communications; or

     - 55% of the merger consideration in cash and 45% of the merger
       consideration in D&E Communications common stock.

     The calculation of the merger consideration to be paid to Conestoga
shareholders will be determined as follows (subject, however, to a proration
adjustment as discussed on pages 58 through 59):

     - If the merger consideration is to be paid 100% in cash, each share of
       Conestoga common stock will be exchanged for $33.00 in cash.

     - If the merger consideration is to be paid 100% in shares of D&E
       Communications common stock and the volume weighted average per share
       sales price of D&E Communications common stock for the 20 trading days
       during which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs
       immediately preceding the second business day before we complete the
       merger:

         - is less than $13.00, then the per share value of the common stock
           consideration to be paid will be equal to the product of (i) 2.5385
           and (ii) the fair market value of D&E Communications common stock on
           the closing date.

         - is greater than $23.00, then the per share value of the common stock
           consideration to be paid will be equal to the product of (i) 1.4348
           and (ii) the fair market value of D&E Communications common stock on
           the closing date.

         - is between $13.00 and $23.00, then the per share value of the common
           stock consideration to be paid will be equal to $33.00 in shares of
           D&E Communications common stock (using the volume weighted average
           per share sales price to determine the number of shares to be
           issued).

     - If the merger consideration is to be paid 55% in cash and 45% in shares
       of D&E Communications common stock and the volume weighted average per
       share sales price of D&E Communications common stock for the 20 trading
       days, during which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs,
       immediately preceding the second business day before we complete the
       merger:

         - is less than $13.00, the value of the cash merger consideration would
           be $18.15 in cash and the value of the common stock consideration
           would be equal to the product of (i) 2.5385 multiplied by .45 and
           (ii) the fair market value of D&E Communications common stock on the
           closing date.

         - is greater than $23.00, the value of the cash merger consideration
           would be $18.15 in cash and the value of the common stock
           consideration would be equal to the product of (i) 1.4348 multiplied
           by .45 and (ii) the fair market value of D&E Communications common
           stock on the closing date.

         - is between $13.00 and $23.00, then the per share value of the cash
           merger consideration will be $18.15 in cash and the value of the
           common stock consideration will be $14.85 in shares of D&E
           Communications common stock (using the average sales price to
           determine the number of shares to be issued).

- ---------------

(1) Represents the volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E
    Communications common stock for the twenty trading days, during which
    trading in D&E Communications common stock occurred, immediately preceding
    the second business day before we complete the merger.

(2) Assumes that immediately before we complete the merger there are 8,287,669
    shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding (including the 210,256 shares
    assumed to have been issued upon conversion of the 74,243 shares of
    Conestoga series A preferred stock).

(3) Assumes that each Conestoga shareholder has elected to have 55% of his or
    her shares convert into cash consideration and 45% of his or her shares
    convert into D&E Communications common stock consideration.

(4) Determined by multiplying the aggregate number of D&E Communications common
    shares by the reference volume weighted average per share sales price of D&E
    Communications common stock.

(5) Represents the sum of the aggregate value of D&E Communications common
    shares issued as stock consideration and the aggregate amount of cash
    consideration.

(6) Assumes that immediately before we complete the merger there are 7,350,838
    shares of D&E Communications common stock outstanding.

(7) Conestoga has the right to terminate the merger agreement if the volume
    weighted average per share sales price of D&E Communications common stock
    for any 10 consecutive trading days, during which the trading in D&E
    Communications common stock occurs, is less than $8.00.

(8) The merger will be fully taxable at approximately this share price, assuming
    (a) 8,287,669 shares of Conestoga common stock are outstanding, (b) all
    outstanding shares of Conestoga series A preferred stock have converted into
    common stock, (c) 55% of Conestoga shares of common stock are to be
    converted into cash consideration and 45% of such shares are to be converted
    into D&E Communications common stock, and (d) no cash in lieu of fractional
    shares is paid.

PRORATION ADJUSTMENT

     In certain circumstances, a Conestoga shareholder's election to receive the
merger consideration either 100% in cash or 100% in shares of D&E Communications
common stock may be subject to a proration adjustment.

     If the elections of Conestoga shareholders would result in the conversion
of more than 55% of the outstanding Conestoga shares into cash, the number of
shares of Conestoga common stock of shareholders electing to receive 100% cash
to actually be converted into cash will be reduced on a pro rata basis until
only 55% of Conestoga's outstanding shares are to be converted into cash. Shares
of Conestoga common stock of a Conestoga shareholder who has elected to receive
100% cash that are not converted into cash in the merger as a result of such pro
rata adjustment will be converted into a number of shares of D&E Communications
common stock equal to the product of the number of Conestoga shares to be
converted into stock consideration multiplied by the exchange ratio.

     If the elections of Conestoga shareholders would result in the issuance of
more than 9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications common stock to Conestoga
shareholders in the merger, the number of shares of Conestoga common stock of
shareholders electing to receive 100% stock to actually be converted into shares
of D&E Communications common stock will be reduced on a pro rata basis until
only 9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications common stock are issued in
connection with the merger. Each share of Conestoga common stock of a Conestoga
shareholder who has elected to receive 100% stock that is not converted into
shares of D&E Communications common stock in the merger as a result of such pro
rata adjustment will be converted into $33 in cash.

     Because of these limitations on the cash and the number of shares of
Conestoga common stock to be issued as merger consideration under the election
and allocation procedures, holders of Conestoga common stock who elect to
receive all cash or all D&E Communications common stock may not receive their
requested form of merger consideration. Each shareholder electing to receive
100% cash consideration will receive $33 per share cash consideration in respect
of at least 55% of such shareholder's Conestoga shares, and each shareholder
electing to receive 100% D&E Communications common stock consideration will
receive stock consideration (determined by reference to the exchange ratio) in
respect of at least 45% of such shareholder's Conestoga shares. Conestoga
shareholders electing to receive cash for 55% of their shares of Conestoga
common stock and D&E Communications common stock for 45% of their shares of
Conestoga common stock will receive cash and stock in accordance with their
election.

     The following are examples of the effects of the proration of the merger
consideration:

     - If all Conestoga shareholders elect to receive 100% cash, then 55% of
       each Conestoga shareholder's shares will be converted into cash
       consideration and 45% of each Conestoga shareholder's shares will be
       converted into D&E Communications common stock consideration.

     - If the holders of 60% of the total outstanding shares of Conestoga common
       stock elect to receive 100% cash, then each shareholder who elects to
       receive 100% D&E Communications common stock will receive all of his or
       her merger consideration in shares of D&E Communications common stock,
       and each Conestoga shareholder who elects to receive 100% cash will
       receive $33 in cash for that number of shares of Conestoga common stock
       equal to the product of (i) the number of Conestoga shares owned by such
       shareholder and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is an amount
       equal to the product of .55, the number of outstanding shares of
       Conestoga common stock and $33.00, minus the aggregate amount of cash
       consideration to be paid to Conestoga shareholders who have elected to
       receive a combination of cash and stock (including those who are deemed
       to have made such election by failing to make a proper election), and the
       denominator of which is the aggregate amount of cash that would have been
       paid to Conestoga shareholders electing to receive 100% cash
       consideration before taking into account any proration.

     - If the holders of 50% of the total outstanding shares of Conestoga common
       stock elect to receive 100% D&E Communications common stock
       consideration, then each shareholder who elects to receive 100% cash will
       receive all of his or her merger consideration in cash, and, if, based on
       the applicable

       exchange ratio and without giving effect to any proration, no more than
       9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications common stock would be issuable to
       Conestoga shareholders electing to receive part or all of their merger
       consideration in stock, then each Conestoga shareholder who elects to
       receive 100% D&E Communications common stock will receive all of his or
       her merger consideration in shares of D&E Communications common stock.
       If, however, based on the applicable exchange ratio and without giving
       effect to any proration, more than 9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications
       common stock would be issuable to Conestoga shareholders electing to
       receive part or all of their merger consideration in stock, then the
       number of shares of Conestoga common stock of any Conestoga shareholder
       who elects to receive 100% D&E Communications common stock consideration
       to actually be converted into stock consideration will equal the product
       of (i) the number of Conestoga shares owned by such shareholder and (ii)
       a fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to 9,467,068 minus
       the aggregate number of shares of D&E Communications common stock to be
       issued to Conestoga shareholders who have elected to receive a
       combination of cash and stock (including those who are deemed to have
       made such election by failing to make a proper election), and the
       denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of D&E
       Communications common stock that would have been issued to Conestoga
       shareholders electing to receive 100% D&E Communications common stock
       consideration before taking into account any proration.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     Shortly after the merger becomes effective, D&E Communications will deposit
with [EXCHANGE AGENT] (the exchange agent) certificates representing the shares
of its common stock and the cash to be issued or paid as merger consideration.
Each Conestoga shareholder can elect on the election form sent along with this
document to receive cash, D&E Communications common stock or a combination of
both to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. See "-- Procedures for
Shareholder Elections." The election form contains instructions on how to
surrender Conestoga common stock certificates to the exchange agent and receive
cash, D&E Communications common stock, or a combination thereof, as the case may
be. A Conestoga shareholder who does not properly submit an election form will
be sent a letter of transmittal after the election deadline with instructions on
how to exchange Conestoga certificates for the merger consideration. See
"-- Procedures for Shareholder Elections" and "-- Shareholder Elections."

     D&E Communications will not issue any fractions of a share as merger
consideration. If the stock consideration to be issued to a Conestoga
shareholder is not a whole number of shares, D&E Communications will pay to such
Conestoga shareholder, in lieu of any fractional interest, an amount in cash,
without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by
multiplying (x) the volume weighted average sales price of D&E Communications
common stock for the 20 trading days, during which trading in D&E Communications
common stock occurs immediately preceding the second business day before we
complete the merger by (y) the fractional interest in a share of D&E
Communications common stock.

     No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective
time of the merger with respect to shares of D&E Communications common stock
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate with respect to
shares of D&E Communications common stock issuable upon surrender of the
certificates until the holder of the certificate surrenders the certificate in
accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement.

     Any merger consideration deposited with the exchange agent that has
remained unclaimed by Conestoga shareholders for one year after the
effectiveness of the merger will be returned to D&E Communications. Thereafter,
Conestoga shareholders who have not previously complied with the exchange
procedures under the merger agreement may look only to the surviving corporation
in the merger for payment of any merger consideration upon surrender of their
certificates of Conestoga common stock.

     After the effective time of the merger, there will be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Conestoga of any shares of Conestoga common stock. If,
after the effective time of the merger, certificates formerly representing
shares of Conestoga common stock are presented to the exchange agent, they will
be cancelled

and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)
exchanged for merger consideration as provided above.

     The exchange agent or D&E Communications will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the merger consideration any amounts that the exchange agent, D&E
Communications or the surviving corporation, in its capacity as the surviving
corporation in the merger, is required to deduct and withhold under applicable
tax laws. Any amounts so withheld will be treated for purposes of the merger
agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Conestoga common
stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding has been made.

TREATMENT OF CONESTOGA STOCK OPTIONS

     On the date the merger becomes effective, each option granted by Conestoga
to purchase shares of Conestoga common stock will be assumed by D&E
Communications and will become a right to purchase a number of shares of D&E
Communications common stock determined by multiplying the number of Conestoga
shares to which the option relates by the exchange ratio. Each option will be
assumed by D&E Communications in accordance with the terms of the option plan
and option agreement under which it was granted. Pursuant to action taken by
Conestoga's board of directors, all options assumed by D&E Communications under
the merger agreement will at the discretion of the optionees be fully
exercisable. The exercise price of the options assumed by D&E Communications
pursuant to the merger agreement will be equal to the exercise price of such
options divided by the exchange ratio.

     Interim Operations of D&E Communications.  Subject to certain exceptions,
including actions in accordance with the written consent of Conestoga and as
provided in D&E Communications' capital and operating budget, D&E Communications

     D&E Communications has also agreed not to:

       portion of the cash for the merger consideration) in any material
       respect;

     - change its current dividend policy;

       the effective time of the merger.

NO SOLICITATION

     Conestoga has agreed to certain limitations on its ability to take action
with respect to a competing transaction. Conestoga agreed it would not, and
agreed it would not permit any subsidiary to:

     - solicit, encourage, or facilitate any inquiries relating to any proposal
       from any person that is not affiliated with D&E Communications to acquire
       ownership of 5% or more of:

      - the assets of Conestoga and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

      - equity securities of Conestoga pursuant to a merger or other business
        combination, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets or similar
        transaction, which is structured to permit a third party to acquire
        ownership of more than 5% of the assets of Conestoga and its
        subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

      - any class of equity securities of Conestoga;

     - participate in any discussions or furnish any information with respect
       to, or take any action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal
       that constitutes, or that could lead to, a competing transaction, or
       waive the provisions of any "standstill" or similar agreement; or

     - enter into any agreement with respect to a competing transaction, approve
       or recommend or resolve to approve or recommend a competing transaction
       or enter into any agreement requiring it to terminate or fail to
       consummate the merger.

     If Conestoga receives a bona fide, unsolicited, written proposal for a
superior competing transaction, Conestoga may furnish information regarding
Conestoga and its subsidiaries to and participate in negotiations with a third
party, if Conestoga complies with the "No Solicitation" section of the merger
agreement. A competing transaction is a superior competing transaction if it
meets the following criteria:

     - Conestoga's Board determines in good faith (after consulting the Board's
       independent financial advisor) that:

      - the transaction will result in terms which are more favorable from a
        financial point of view to Conestoga's shareholders than the merger and,
        after consultation with counsel, determines that failure to take that
        action may result in a breach of the board's fiduciary duties;

      - the transaction is reasonably capable of being consummated; and

      - the transaction is subject to a confidentiality agreement on terms no
        less favorable to Conestoga than the confidentiality agreements dated
        May 15, 2001 and October 24, 2001 with D&E Communications; and

     - Conestoga complies with the "No Solicitation" provision of the merger
       agreement.

     Prior to furnishing any information or participating in negotiations with a
third party, Conestoga must provide written notice to D&E Communications. In
addition, Conestoga must advise D&E Communications orally and in writing of the
following:

     - any competing transaction or any inquiry which could reasonably lead to
       any competing transaction;

     - the identity of the party submitting a competing transaction or making
       any inquiry; and

     - the material terms and conditions of any competing transaction.

     Conestoga agrees to keep D&E Communications reasonably informed on a
current basis of the status and details of any competing transaction (including
amendments and proposed amendments) proposal or inquiry in a timely manner.

     Conestoga's Board is permitted to withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to D&E Communications, its recommendation to Conestoga's shareholders,
if:

     - a third party submits an unsolicited competing transaction that
       Conestoga's Board believes is reasonably likely to result in a superior
       competing transaction and, after consultation with counsel, determines
       that failure to take action may result in a breach of fiduciary duties;
       and

     - Conestoga delivers to D&E Communications prior written notice that it
       intends to take action relating to a superior competing transaction, and
       identifies the party making, and the terms and conditions of, the
       superior competing transaction.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement provides that, from and after the effective time of
the merger, D&E Communications and the surviving corporation will indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each person
who is, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement or who
becomes prior to the effective time of the merger, an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of Conestoga or any of its subsidiaries against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their
capacities as such, which acts and omissions occurred prior to the effective
time of the merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
effective time of the merger.

     Under the merger agreement, D&E Communications has agreed to cause the
surviving corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years
Conestoga's current directors', officers' and fiduciaries insurance policies (or
maintain policies with equivalent coverage) with an amount of coverage not less
than the existing coverage with respect to acts or failure to act prior to the
effective time of the merger. Nevertheless, D&E Communications and the surviving
corporation will not be required to maintain or obtain policies providing the
coverage except to the extent the coverage can be provided at less than two
times the existing annual premium. If equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or
can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of two times the
existing annual premium, D&E Communications or the surviving corporation will be
required to obtain only as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual
premium equal to two times the existing annual premium.

     In addition, D&E Communications has agreed to cause the surviving
corporation to keep in effect for a period of not less than six years from the
effective date of the merger all provisions in the surviving corporation's
articles of incorporation and bylaws that provide for exculpation of and
limitation of personal liability of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
and agents.

EMPLOYEES

     Following the effective time of the merger, D&E Communications will cause
the merger subsidiary to:

     - satisfy each of the agreements and arrangements described in the
       "Employees" section of the merger agreement;

     - use its commercially reasonable efforts to retain each present full-time
       employee of Conestoga at his or her current position with such current
       responsibilities (or a position for which the employee is qualified at a
       salary commensurate with the current position); and

     - pay compensation to each person who was employed as of the effective time
       of the merger and who continues to be employed after the effective time
       of the merger, that is at least equal to the aggregate compensation that
       such person was receiving from Conestoga prior to the effective time of
       the merger.

     Officers and employees of Conestoga who continue employment with D&E
Communications or the surviving corporation after the effective time of the
merger and who have employment contracts will be employed under the terms and
conditions of their respective employment contracts. All other employees who
continue employment with D&E Communications or the surviving corporation will be
"at will" employees. Any at will employee whose employment does not continue or
is terminated (other than as a result of unsatisfactory performance of their
respective duties or for cause) by D&E Communications or the surviving
corporation will be paid a minimum of two weeks' salary, with an additional one
week's salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks' salary.

     Following the effective time of the merger, D&E Communications has also
agreed to:

     - provide employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies for
       the benefit of current retired employees of Conestoga and current retired
       nonemployee directors of Conestoga, having terms that are no less
       favorable than the terms of Conestoga's benefit plans; and

     - allow future retired nonemployee directors (including any spouse or
       surviving spouse) to participate in a health and welfare plan, provided
       that all expenses associated with such participation shall be the sole
       responsibility of such retired nonemployee director (or, as applicable, a
       spouse or surviving spouse).

     For a period of two years following the effective time of the merger, D&E
Communications has agreed to provide employee benefit plans, programs,
arrangements and policies for the benefit of employees and future retired
employees (namely, employees who retire after the date of the merger agreement)
of Conestoga and its subsidiaries that in the aggregate are no less favorable to
the employees and future retired employees than Conestoga's benefit plans. In
the case of benefit plans and programs under which benefits are paid or
determined by reference to the value of Conestoga's stock, D&E Communications
agrees that the benefits will be determined by reference to the value of shares
of common stock of D&E Communications in an equitable manner. All service
credited to each employee and retired employee by Conestoga through the
effective time of the merger will be recognized by D&E Communications for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accruals) under D&E
Communications' benefit plans. D&E Communications agrees not to treat any
Conestoga employee as a "new" employee or retired employee for purposes of any
pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements or similar provision under any health or other welfare plan, and
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements
with its insurance carriers to ensure such result.

     D&E Communications also agreed to honor and assume, or cause the merger
subsidiary to honor and assume, the employment agreements, executive termination
agreements and individual benefit arrangements identified in the "Employees"
section of the merger agreement, except to the extent that the agreements are
waived by the employees prior to the effective time of the merger.

SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS

     Each of Conestoga and D&E Communications has agreed promptly and duly to
call, give notice of, and convene and hold their respective special shareholders
meetings. The Conestoga shareholders' special meeting will be held for the
purpose of obtaining shareholder approval of the merger agreement. The D&E
Communications shareholders meeting will be held for the purpose of obtaining
shareholder approval of the merger proposal. Each of Conestoga and D&E
Communications has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from its respective shareholders proxies in favor of such approvals, and will
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
its shareholders required by state law or the Nasdaq National Market, as
applicable, to obtain such approvals.

TAX MATTERS

     D&E Communications and Conestoga will each use its reasonable good faith
efforts to cause the merger to constitute a reorganization under the provisions
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the merger
constitutes a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a), D&E
Communications will deliver to Conestoga an opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
LLP, special counsel to D&E Communications, which states that:

     - for federal income tax purposes, the merger will be a reorganization
       within the meaning of Section 368(a);

     - neither D&E Communications, Conestoga nor the surviving corporation will
       recognize any gain or loss upon completion of the merger;

     - a Conestoga shareholder will not recognize any gain or loss upon the
       exchange of his shares of Conestoga common stock solely for shares of D&E
       Communications common stock in the merger;

     - a Conestoga shareholder who receives cash and shares of D&E
       Communications common stock in exchange for shares of Conestoga stock in
       the merger will recognize any gain realized (including any gain treated
       as a dividend) up to the amount of cash received, but will not recognize
       any loss; and

     - a Conestoga shareholder who receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of
       D&E Communications common stock will recognize gain or loss with respect
       to the receipt of such fractional shares.

     The issuance of the tax opinion of special counsel, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
LLP, is conditioned on (i) the reasonable opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP
(or other counsel reasonably agreed to by the parties) that the tax opinion can
be given and (ii) the receipt by counsel of representation letters from each of
Conestoga, D&E Communications and the surviving corporation, which will be dated
on or before the date of such opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or
modified in any material respect, in each case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to counsel.

     Each of Conestoga and D&E Communications agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to provide such representation letters in substantially the same form as
Exhibits F and G to the merger agreement.

SALE OF CONESTOGA'S WIRELESS OPERATIONS

     D&E Communications and Conestoga have agreed to cooperate and use their
best efforts to enter into an agreement with an appropriate third party to sell
Conestoga's wireless operations (pursuant to a sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of such operations) on terms and conditions acceptable to D&E
Communications and Conestoga. In addition, pursuant to the agreement with
affiliates of VoiceStream providing for the sale by D&E Wireless (an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of D&E Communications) of its interest in the PCS One
partnership, D&E Communications is bound by certain non-competition covenants.
See "Description of D&E Communications -- Recent Developments" on page 94. The
provision of mobile voice wireless communications services in the Reading,
Pennsylvania market, which is restricted under the VoiceStream agreement,
represents approximately 37% of the population area serviced by Conestoga's
wireless operations. Consequently, D&E Communications may be required to dispose
of that portion of Conestoga's wireless operations shortly after the closing of
the merger.

CERTAIN OTHER AGREEMENTS

     Conestoga and D&E Communications have agreed to other customary agreements
in the merger agreement, including agreements related to:

     - assisting in the preparation of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
       the filing of the registration statement by D&E Communications;

     - providing access to and furnishing information in accordance with the
       terms of confidentiality agreements between D&E Communications and
       Conestoga dated as of May 15, 2001 and October 24, 2001;

     - using commercially reasonable efforts to do all things necessary to
       complete the merger, including:

      - obtaining necessary actions from governmental entities;

       announcement relating to the merger agreement.

agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated may be abandoned:

     - by the mutual written consent of D&E Communications and Conestoga;

     - unless the failure to complete the merger is the result of the failure of

        of Conestoga is not true and correct (in all material respects in cases
        where the representation and warranty is not already qualified as to
        materiality); or

      - Conestoga breaches the provision of the merger agreement addressing
        solicitation of, and response to, competing offers or Conestoga's Board
        withholds, withdraws or materially modifies or amends its recommendation
        of the merger or the merger agreement.

     - by Conestoga if:

      - D&E Communications fails to perform any material obligation and such
        failure is not cured within 30 days after the receipt of notice;

      - as of the effective time of the merger, any representation or warranty
        of D&E Communications is not true and correct (in all material respects
        in cases where the representation and warranty is not already qualified
        as to materiality);

      - the volume weighted average of the per-share sales price (excluding
        after market trading) of D&E Communications common stock, calculated to
        two decimal places, for any ten days during which trading in D&E
        Communications common stock occurs after the date of the merger
        agreement is less than $8, provided Conestoga exercises its termination
        right within two business days after the end of the applicable ten day
        trading period; or

      - Conestoga's Board withholds, withdraws or materially changes or amends
        its recommendation of the merger or the merger agreement and there is a
        proposal or offer for a competing transaction that constitutes a
        superior competing transaction; provided that Conestoga may not
        terminate the merger agreement until:

        - Conestoga delivers written notice to D&E Communications of the Board's
          determination and Conestoga gives D&E Communications ten business days
          and a reasonable opportunity to discuss with Conestoga the superior
          competing transaction and any proposed amendments to the merger
          agreement;

        - at the end of the ten business day period, the superior competing
          transaction continues to be a superior proposal and Conestoga's Board
          confirms its determination, after consultation with its counsel and
          its independent financial advisor, that it is a superior competing
          transaction; and

        - Conestoga pays D&E Communications $10 million in liquidated (and
          exclusive) damages.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     Payment of Termination Fee by Conestoga.  Conestoga will pay D&E
Communications $10 million in liquidated damages if:

     - D&E Communications terminates the merger agreement because Conestoga
       breaches the provision of the merger agreement addressing solicitation
       of, and response to, competing offers or Conestoga's Board withholds,
       withdraws or materially amends its recommendation to the Conestoga
       shareholders;

     - Conestoga terminates the merger agreement after Conestoga's Board
       withholds, withdraws or materially changes its recommendation to the
       Conestoga shareholders following the receipt of a proposal for superior
       competing transaction; or

     - Conestoga enters into a definitive agreement for, or approves or
       recommends, a competing transaction or agrees or resolves to do the
       foregoing within nine months after termination of the merger agreement,
       provided that the $10 million will be reduced by the amount of any
       expenses previously reimbursed to D&E Communications.

     Payment of Expenses by Conestoga.  Conestoga will pay D&E Communications'
documented expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement:

     - if either D&E Communications or Conestoga terminates the merger agreement
       as a result of the receipt by Conestoga of, prior to termination, a
       proposal or offer for a superior competing transaction; or

     - if Conestoga terminates the merger agreement because the volume weighted
       average of the per-share sales price (excluding after market trading) of
       D&E Communications common stock during a ten day trading period during
       which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs was less than $8.

     Payment of Termination Fee by D&E Communications.  D&E Communications will
pay Conestoga $10 million in liquidated (and exclusive) damages if the merger
agreement is terminated by Conestoga (at a time when there is no other basis for
any party to terminate the merger agreement) solely because:

     - D&E Communications fails to perform any material obligation and such
       failure is not cured within 30 days after the receipt of notice; or

     - any representation or warranty of D&E Communications is not true and
       correct as of the effective time of the merger and such failure is not
       cured within 30 days after the receipt of notice.

AMENDMENTS

     D&E Communications and Conestoga may modify or amend the merger agreement
by written agreement. Following approval of the merger agreement by the
shareholders of Conestoga, no amendment may be made which changes the
consideration payable in the merger or adversely affects the rights of
Conestoga's shareholders without their approval.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of
September 30, 2001 and unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001, and for the year
ended December 31, 2000, combine historical financial information of D&E
Communications and Conestoga to give effect to the merger of D&E Communications
and Conestoga. These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements, along with the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 that are also
presented below, contain additional adjustments to give effect to certain other
transactions described in more detail below.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of September
30, 2001 has been prepared as if the merger and the other transactions had
occurred on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 and for the year
ended December 31, 2000 assume that the merger and the other transactions were
consummated on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, are
included to reflect the operations of D&E Communications wireless PCS business
as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions" ("APB 30").

     These unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only. They are not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or operating results that would have occurred had the merger and the
other transactions been completed on the dates assumed above, nor is the
information indicative of the future financial position or operating results.
Results of operations and the financial position after completion of the merger
could differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements, which are based on past operations.
Future operations will be affected by various factors, including operating
performance, telecommunications industry developments and other matters.

     In accordance with pro forma financial statement requirements, the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations exclude the
effects of discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effects
of changes in accounting principles. You should read the financial information
in this section along with D&E Communications' and Conestoga's historical
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of September
30, 2001 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 and for the year ended
December 31, 2000, have been prepared to reflect the merger under the purchase
method of accounting with D&E Communications as the acquiring entity. The excess
of the purchase price, including estimated fees and expenses related to the
merger, over the estimated fair value of the net assets of Conestoga, is
classified as goodwill in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet. The estimated fair values and useful lives of
Conestoga's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which were utilized to
calculate goodwill, are preliminary and subject to final valuation determined by
an appraiser subsequent to consummation of the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma financial statements do not reflect any anticipated
cost savings or other benefits that D&E Communications may realize from the
elimination of duplicate corporate and administrative programs in connection
with the merger or increased operating efficiency resulting from the merger.

     Consideration for this acquisition will consist of cash and the issuance of
shares of D&E Communications common stock. Pursuant to the merger agreement, no
more than 55% of the number of shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding
immediately before the merger may be converted into cash consideration. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements assume that 55% of
the outstanding Conestoga common shares were each exchanged for cash
consideration of $33 and 45% of the outstanding Conestoga

common shares were exchanged for D&E Communications common stock at an exchange
ratio of 1.7479 shares of D&E Communications common stock for each share of
Conestoga common stock. The exchange ratio was determined assuming a price per
D&E Communications common share of $18.88, which represents the closing price on
December 21, 2001. The pro forma financial information includes a sensitivity
analysis that shows the effect on certain pro forma financial information of
various cash consideration election scenarios and a range of D&E Communications
common share prices at closing.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of September
30, 2001 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 and for the year ended
December 31, 2000, also reflect the following:

     - An assumed conversion of all outstanding Conestoga series A preferred
       stock into Conestoga common stock.

     - The treatment of Conestoga's wireless personal communication services
       business after consummation of the merger as assets and liabilities of
       wireless operations held for sale and its related operating activities as
       discontinued operations as a result of the provisions in the merger
       agreement relating to the probable sale of such business.

     - The treatment of D&E Communications' wireless personal communication
       services business and its related operating activities as discontinued
       operations as a result of the pending sale of such business.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, have been prepared to reflect the
operations of D&E Communications' wireless personal communication services
business as discontinued operations under APB 30 as a result of its pending
sale.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
          (DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS)

(1) - D&E WIRELESS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     On October 17, 2001, D&E Wireless, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of D&E
Communications, and affiliates of VoiceStream Wireless Corporation
("VoiceStream") entered into a definitive agreement (the "Agreement") to sell
D&E Communications 50% joint venture interest in D&E/Omnipoint Wireless Joint
Venture, L.P., which conducts a wireless telecommunications business as "PCS
One" ("PCS One").

     In December 2001, management of D&E Communications determined that it was
probable that existing contingencies to consummate the sale will be resolved. As
such, D&E Communications has made adjustments to present the operations of D&E
Communications' wireless segment as discontinued operations in accordance with
APB 30.

     The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet includes adjustments to
eliminate D&E Communications' wireless assets and liabilities to be sold,
including the related equity in losses of PCS One in excess of investments and
advances of $10,391; recognize $36,000 of estimated cash proceeds on the sale,
net of estimated taxes of $38,000; recognize $3,000 for the estimated value of
equipment to be received from PCS One; and recognize in retained earnings
$49,391 of estimated gain on sale, net of estimated taxes of $38,000.

     The pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the nine
month period ended September 30, 2001, and the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, include adjustments to reclassify the results of D&E
Communications' wireless operations as discontinued operations, which include
the equity losses from PCS One and related wireless segment operations that are
not expected to continue subsequent to the disposal. The pro forma combined
condensed statements of operations do not include any recognition of the gain
expected on disposition.

(2) - CONESTOGA PREFERRED STOCK CONVERSION

     On December 28, 2001, Conestoga's board of directors voted to redeem all of
Conestoga's outstanding shares of its series A preferred stock. The redemption
terms of the preferred stock require Conestoga to pay $66.30 plus accrued
dividends for each preferred share redeemed. A notice of redemption was sent to
all preferred shareholders on January 7, 2002 informing them that the redemption
will take place on February 6, 2002 unless they exercise their right to convert
their preferred shares to Conestoga common stock. Under the conversion terms of
the preferred stock, preferred shareholders may, during the notice period, elect
to convert each preferred share into 2.8322 shares of Conestoga common stock at
the conversion price of $22.95 per share rather than have their preferred shares
redeemed by Conestoga. We have assumed that all shares of Conestoga series A
preferred stock (with an aggregate cash redemption value of $5,001 plus accrued
dividends) will be converted into Conestoga common stock (with an aggregate
transaction value of $7,050), prior to consummation of the merger. As of
September 30, 2001, 75,428 shares of Conestoga redeemable preferred stock were
outstanding, which will convert into 213,612 shares of Conestoga common stock.

(3) - MERGER TRANSACTION

     Conestoga shareholders may elect to receive their merger consideration in
stock, cash or a combination of 45% stock and 55% cash, provided that no more
than 55% of the Conestoga common shares will be converted into cash in the
merger and that no more than 9,467,068 shares of D&E Communications common stock
will be issued in the merger. For purposes of preparing the pro forma financial
data D&E Communications has assumed that Conestoga shareholders would elect to
receive the maximum cash consideration available. For purposes of calculating
the number of D&E Communications shares to be issued in the merger, D&E
Communications has utilized $18.88 per share, which represents the closing price
on December 21, 2001. The actual number of shares to be issued and cash
consideration to be provided in the merger will be based on elections made by
each shareholder and the volume weighted average per share sales price for the
twenty

trading days, during which trading in D&E Communications common stock occurs,
immediately preceding the date this is two business days prior to the effective
date of the merger. See Note (5) for a sensitivity analysis assuming a range of
cash consideration elections and D&E Communications common stock price at
closing.

     Under the merger agreement, based on the assumed closing price of $18.88
per share and 8,068,639 shares of Conestoga common stock outstanding at
September 30, 2001 (8,282,251 after the assumed preferred stock conversion
discussed in Note 2), Conestoga stockholders would receive consideration of
$33.00 per share of Conestoga stock. Total consideration is expected to be
approximately $273,315 as follows:

(3a) - The following represents the adjustments for the excess of the estimated
       purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net identifiable
       assets acquired.

        The Conestoga stock options outstanding at the effective date of the
        merger will become fully vested. All option holders will receive fully
        vested D&E Communications options based on the exchange ratio in effect
        at the close of the transaction.

        In connection with its entry into the merger agreement with D&E
        Communications, Conestoga was required to pay NTELOS, Inc. a $10,000 fee
        for terminating its merger agreement with NTELOS. Conestoga financed the
        $10,000 fee through its existing bank line of credit.

        The employment contract settlement payments and consummation bonuses are
        change of control benefits provided to certain Conestoga employees under
        their employment agreements and are to be paid at consummation of the
        merger. Payments have been reflected as a reduction in cash.

                            D&E COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL
                           STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

        Transaction expenses include investment banker fees of $6,300, and
        legal, accounting, registration and other fees of $2,700. The pro forma
        balance sheet assumes that the transaction expenses will be financed
        with additional long-term debt.

        D&E Communications has preliminarily allocated the excess of the
        estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net
        identifiable assets acquired. The final allocation of the excess
        purchase price over net identifiable assets will be determined by the
        Company based on reports of independent appraisers and other information
        subsequent to consummation of the merger. The final allocation will
        include, if applicable, recognition of adjustments to the amounts noted
        above, recognition of any further adjustments to tangible assets and
        liabilities to state them at their fair values, and recognition of any
        additional identifiable intangible assets at their fair values. The
        residual effect of such adjustments will be recorded as goodwill. These
        pro forma statements provide for the accounting treatment of the merger
        and related transactions to be in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
        "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
        Assets".

(3b) - The net adjustment to common equity resulting from the issuance of new
       D&E Communications common equity and the elimination of historical
       Conestoga equity as follows:

       D&E Communications stock to be issued.....................   $122,992
       Fair value of stock options...............................      2,000
       Less: Conestoga shareholders' equity (after conversion of
          Conestoga common shares in the merger).................    (79,050)
                                                                    --------
                                                                    $ 45,942
                                                                    ========

(3c) - D&E Communications has an existing long-term incentive plan arrangement
       that provides for accelerated vesting of performance restricted stock and
       cash incentive awards granted under the plan upon consummation of the
       merger. Under the plan agreement and grant documents, at consummation of
       the merger, 103,079 restricted shares of D&E Communications' common stock
       with a value of $1,946 will come fully vested and cash incentive awards
       of $797 will be paid. Through September 30, 2001, $1,217 of expense
       associated with the plan had been accrued. The pro forma balance sheet
       includes adjustments to recognize the impact of the acceleration
       including a charge to retained earnings of $992, net of tax of $534, for
       the incremental expense to be recognized.

(3d) - It is assumed that the majority of the purchase price associated with the
       cash payments to Conestoga stockholders will be financed with additional
       long-term debt ($114,000). Additionally, it is assumed that the
       transaction fees of $9,000 will be funded with additional long-term debt.

       Subsequent to September 30, 2001, D&E Communications obtained an
       additional commitment from a bank to provide an 8 1/2-year variable-rate
       senior secured term loan for $100,000 (4.25% interest rate assumed for
       pro forma statements). In addition, and also subsequent to September 30,
       2001, D&E Communications refinanced certain existing debt to include an
       8 1/2-year variable-rate senior secured reducing revolving credit
       facility for $50,000 (4.25% interest rate assumed for pro forma
       statements) and a ten-year variable rate term loan for $50,000 (4.25%
       interest rate assumed for pro forma statements). See Note 3c. In
       connection with these financing transactions, D&E Communications incurred
       debt issuance costs of $6,110, which will be amortized over the
       8 1/2-year life of the debt.

       In addition, subsequent to September 30, 2001, Conestoga financed its
       $10,000 termination fee with NTELOS, Inc. through its variable rate
       long-term line-of-credit facility (2.83% interest rate assumed for pro
       forma statements).

           NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL
                           STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

       The pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the nine
       month period ended September 30, 2001, and the year ended December 31,
       2000 include adjustments for the interest expense related to the
       additional long-term debt of $4,328, and $5,770, respectively. The
       statements also include additional interest expense of $539, and $719,
       respectively for the amortization of the debt issuance costs.

       A 0.125% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rate applicable to
       the incremental long term debt associated with the merger transaction
       would change the pro forma interest expense and income before taxes by
       $130 and $174 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 and for
       the year ended December 31, 2000, respectively, and pro forma income from
       continuing operations by $85 and $113 for the same respective periods.

(3e) - Subsequent to September 30, 2001, D&E refinanced $46,815 of long-term
       debt (including $854 classified as current portion at September 30, 2001)
       with new variable-rate long-term debt (4.25% interest rate assumed for
       pro forma statements). In connection with the refinancing, an additional
       $3,650 of long-term debt was required in connection with the payment of
       penalties on the early extinguishment of the existing long-term debt. The
       new long-term debt does not require principal payments for two years, and
       therefore, none of the debt is recorded as a current liability. The pro
       forma balance sheet includes an adjustment to retained earnings of
       $2,426, net of tax of $1,307, related to the loss on extinguishment,
       which includes the write-off of $83 of deferred financing costs. The pro
       forma combined condensed statements of operations for the nine month
       period ended September 30, 2001, and the year ended December 31, 2000,
       include adjustments to reduce interest expense related to long-term debt
       of $570, and $747, respectively. The reduction is based on the decline on
       the average interest rates on debt and elimination of amortization of
       deferred financing costs.

(3f) - Goodwill amortization associated with Conestoga acquisitions consummated
       in prior periods has been eliminated. These pro forma statements provide
       for the accounting treatment of the merger and related transactions to be
       in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No.
       142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and therefore goodwill
       related to this merger has not been amortized. SFAS No. 142 is effective
       for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 provides
       that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be
       amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis.
       Since the company is not able to adopt SFAS No. 142 until January 1,
       2002, the D&E Communications historical financial information is not
       adjusted for the impact of the new accounting rules. The company is in
       the process of evaluating the impact SFAS No. 142 to determine what the
       impact will be on their financial statements.

(3g) - Additional amortization expense has been recognized as a result of an
       estimated allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets other
       than goodwill.

(3h) - Additional compensation has been recognized for $315 of retention
       compensation attributable to certain Conestoga employees that is
       scheduled to be earned and paid during the 24 month period following the
       merger date.

(3i) - An adjustment has been made to the pro forma statements of operations for
       the nine-month period ended September 30, 2001 to eliminate third party
       expenses included in Conestoga's historical financial statements which
       are directly related to the merger and which are not of a continuing
       nature.

(3j) - Pro forma adjustments have been made for the estimated income tax effects
       of the adjustments discussed in (2) above assuming an effective income
       tax rate of 35%.

(4) - CONESTOGA WIRELESS BUSINESS TO BE SOLD

     We believe that it is probable that we will sell the Conestoga wireless
business after consummation of the merger. As such, the pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet includes adjustments to reclassify Conestoga's wireless
assets to be sold as assets of wireless operations held for sale and its
liabilities to be included in a sale as liabilities of wireless operations held
for sale. Accordingly, the pro forma combined condensed statements of operations
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 and the year ended December
31, 2000, include adjustments to reclassify the results of Conestoga's wireless
operations as discontinued operations.

condition of Conestoga. During the years 1999 and 2000, the total cash dividend
paid each year by Conestoga was $0.833 and $0.84 per share, respectively.
Dividends were paid quarterly during these years. Under the most restrictive
covenants of Conestoga's debt agreements, $4.9 million of the consolidated
retained earnings as of December 31, 2000 plus seventy-five percent of 2001
consolidated net income, is available for payment of cash dividends in 2001.

     During the second quarter of 1996 Conestoga issued series A preferred
stock. Cumulative dividends of $3.42 per share per annum are paid semi-annually
on the series A preferred stock. During 1999 and 2000, Conestoga paid annual
cash dividends of $3.42 per share on the series A preferred stock. Conestoga
issued a notice of redemption of the Series A preferred stock on January 7, 2002
as further described on page 78.

     As of           , 2002, the record number of D&E Communications
shareholders was approximately                and the record number of
Conestoga's shareholders was approximately                .

     Following the merger, D&E Communications' common stock will continue to be
listed on Nasdaq National Market, and there will be no further market for
Conestoga common stock.

                       COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS

     The rights of Conestoga shareholders are governed by Pennsylvania law,
including the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and Conestoga's Restated
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The rights of D&E Communications
shareholders are governed by Pennsylvania law, including the Pennsylvania
Business Corporation Law, and D&E Communications' Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation and By-Laws.

     Upon consummation of the merger, Conestoga shareholders who elect to
receive D&E Communications common stock as part of their merger consideration
will become D&E Communications shareholders. Consequently, after the merger, the
rights of such shareholders will be governed by the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of D&E Communications and Pennsylvania
law. Because both Conestoga and D&E Communications are Pennsylvania
corporations, the differences in the rights of Conestoga and D&E Communications
shareholders will generally consist of differences found in the companies'
respective articles of incorporation and bylaws.

     A comparison of the major differences between the rights of Conestoga and
D&E Communications shareholders follows. This summary is not intended to be a
complete statement of all of such differences or a complete description of the
specific provisions referred to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Pennsylvania law and the respective articles of incorporation and bylaws
of Conestoga and D&E Communications.

D&E Communications shareholders.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Conestoga.  Under Pennsylvania corporation law, unless otherwise provided
in a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, any director or the entire board of
directors of a corporation may be removed, with or without cause, if the removal
is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, with
certain exceptions in the case of classified boards. As Conestoga's By-laws do
not address removal of directors from office, such action is governed by
Pennsylvania corporation law.

     D&E Communications.  Any D&E Communications director or the entire board
may be removed from office, but only for cause, by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 80% of the shares outstanding and the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the shares outstanding that are not owned by an Interested
Shareholder.

     An "Interested Shareholder" is any person, with the exception of certain
persons named in D&E Communications' Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, that:

     - is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of D&E
       Communications outstanding shares;

     - is an affiliate of D&E Communications and at any time within the prior
       two-year period was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more
       than 10% of D&E Communications outstanding shares;

     - is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to the beneficial ownership
       of any of D&E Communications outstanding shares that were at any time
       within the prior two-year period beneficially owned by any Interested
       Shareholder, if such assignment or succession shall have occurred in the
       course of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a public
       offering; or

     - is an affiliate or associate of such Interested Shareholder or a member
       of a group acting in concert with such Interested Shareholder.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

     Conestoga.  The Pennsylvania corporate law contains provisions applicable
to publicly held Pennsylvania corporations that may be deemed to have an
anti-takeover effect. Conestoga has opted out of all but three of these
provisions.

     Under Pennsylvania corporate law, which applies to Conestoga, directors of
a corporation are not required to regard the interests of its shareholders as
being dominant or controlling in considering the best interests of the
corporation. The directors may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate,
such factors as:

     - the effects of any action upon any group affected by the action,
       including shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and creditors of
       the corporation and upon communities in which offices or other
       establishments of the corporation are located;

     - the short-term and long-term interests of the corporation, including
       benefits that may accrue to the corporation from its long-term plans and
       the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued
       independence of the corporation;

     - the resources, intent and conduct of any person seeking to acquire
       control of the corporation; and

     - all other pertinent factors.

     The Pennsylvania corporate law provisions also provide directors with broad
discretion with respect to actions that may be taken in response to acquisitions
or proposed acquisitions of corporate control.

     Pennsylvania corporate law, which applies to Conestoga, provides for a
five-year moratorium on certain business combinations, such as mergers and stock
acquisitions, with a registered corporation by an interested shareholder after
the date such person first becomes an interested shareholder unless either the
stock purchase through which the interested shareholder became an interested
shareholder receives the prior approval of a corporation's board of directors or
such business combination transaction received the prior approval of a
corporation's board of directors or the approval of the corporation's
shareholders. For this purpose, "interested shareholder" generally means a
person who individually or with or through any of its affiliates or associates
owns stock with 20% or more of the combined vote or shares entitled to elect
directors or who held such amount in the last five years and is still an
affiliate.

     Pennsylvania corporate law, which applies to Conestoga, also provides that
when a person or group of persons acting together holds 20% of the shares
entitled to vote in the election of directors, any other holder of voting shares
of the registered corporation who objects can, within a reasonable time after
the control person or group of persons acquires the 20% stake, require the
control group to purchase his or her shares at a fair value. Fair value is
defined as not less than the highest price per share paid by the control person
at any time during the 90-day period ending on the date of the control
transaction plus any value, including any value paid or payable for the
acquisition of control, that may not be reflected in such price.

     D&E Communications.  While the first and second anti-takeover provisions
described above as applicable to Conestoga also apply to D&E Communications, D&E
Communications has opted out of the third provision described above.

     Pennsylvania corporate law, which applies to D&E Communications, generally
requires disgorgement, by any person or group who or which has acquired or
publicly disclosed an intent to acquire 20% or more of a corporation's voting
power, of any profit realized from the sale of any shares acquired within
specified time periods of such acquisition or disclosure if the shares are sold
within eighteen months thereafter.

     In addition to any affirmative vote required by law, D&E Communications'
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provides for special votes for
certain business combinations with Interested Shareholders. Certain enumerated
business combination transactions with Interested Shareholders require the
affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares outstanding and the affirmative
vote of at least a majority of the shares outstanding that are not owned by an
Interested Shareholder. Such special vote shall not be required if the business
combination has been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or
certain price and procedural requirements set forth in D&E Communications'
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation have been met.

     "Disinterested Director" means a D&E Communications director who is not an
Interested Shareholder or an affiliate, associate or representative of an
Interested Shareholder and either:

     - was a D&E Communications director immediately prior to the time the
       Interested Shareholder involved in the business combination transaction
       in question became an Interested Shareholder; or

     - is a successor to a Disinterested Director and is recommended or elected
       to succeed a Disinterested Director by a majority of the then
       Disinterested Directors.

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

     Conestoga.  Conestoga's By-laws may be amended at any annual or special
meeting of the shareholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast at such meeting. No amendment may be voted on by the shareholders unless it
shall have been previously submitted to and approved by the Conestoga board of
directors, and notice of such amendment was given to each shareholder entitled
to vote at the meeting ten days prior to the meeting.

     D&E Communications.  The D&E Communications board of directors, by a vote
including a majority of the Disinterested Directors then in office, may amend
the D&E Communications' bylaws with respect to those matters that are not by
statute reserved exclusively for the shareholders. Shareholders may amend the
bylaws by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares outstanding and the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares outstanding that are not
owned by an Interested Shareholder. The shareholders may amend the bylaws with
the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting if the
amendment was recommended and submitted to the shareholders for their
consideration by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Disinterested
Directors, and at the time of such recommendation, the Disinterested Directors
constitute at least a majority of the full D&E Communications board of
directors.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES

     Conestoga.  Under Pennsylvania law, an amendment to the articles of
incorporation requires the approval of the board of directors and, except in
limited cases where a greater vote may be required, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote on the matter
and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders
within each class or series of shares if such class or series is entitled to
vote on the matter as a class. Pennsylvania law also provides that shareholders
of a registered corporation, such as Conestoga, are not entitled to propose
amendments to the articles of incorporation. Conestoga's Restated Articles of
Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed as provided by Pennsylvania
law.

     D&E Communications.  D&E Communications' Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation provide that in addition to any affirmative vote required by law,
any amendment to Article 7 (Board of Directors), Article 8 (Votes Required for
Certain Business Combinations), Article 9 (Definitions; Interpretations;
Amendments), Article 10 (Statutory Antitakeover Provisions) and Article 11
(Indemnification and Personal Liability) shall require the affirmative votes of
at least 90% of the shares outstanding and the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the shares outstanding that are not owned by an Interested
Shareholder. The additional vote required for amendments to Articles 7-11 will
not be required if the amendment is recommended by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Disinterested Directors and at the time of such recommendation,
the Disinterested Directors constitute at least a majority of the full D&E
Communications board of directors.

     Conestoga Shareholders' Rights Plan.  On February 29, 2000, Conestoga's
board of directors adopted a Rights Agreement that provides Conestoga's
shareholders with certain stock-related rights in the event of a hostile
takeover but which may have the effect of discouraging such a takeover.

     Pursuant to the Conestoga Rights Agreement, each share of Conestoga common
stock evidences the right of the holder of such share to purchase a share of
Conestoga common stock at a purchase price of $180.00 (subject to certain
adjustments). Until certain events occur, the rights are evidenced by the
existing common stock certificates, and are not separately tradable. Rights
certificates will be issued if a person or

group of persons acquires, has the right to acquire or makes a tender offer that
would result in the person or group having beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of Conestoga common stock. If such a triggering event
occurs, separate certificates evidencing the rights will be issued. However, the
rights are not exercisable until a triggering event occurs, and the rights will
expire at the close of business on March 1, 2010 unless earlier redeemed by the
Company as described below.

     After a triggering event occurs, if Conestoga is the subject of certain
types of takeover attempts, each holder of a right will be entitled to receive,
upon exercise, Conestoga common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash,
property or other securities of Conestoga) having a value equal to two times the
exercise price of the right. In addition, if Conestoga were to complete certain
types of takeover events following a triggering event, the Conestoga Rights
Agreement provides that each holder of a right will be entitled to receive, upon
exercise of the right, common stock or other consideration of the acquiring
company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. The
board of directors of Conestoga is authorized to redeem the rights prior to
their becoming exercisable at a price of $0.01 per right, subject to adjustment.
Once redeemed, the rights will terminate.

                            DESCRIPTION OF CONESTOGA

     Conestoga is a Pennsylvania corporation and a holding company, owning all
of the shares of several subsidiaries engaged in various aspects of the
telecommunication business. These subsidiaries are: Conestoga Telephone and
Telegraph Company; Buffalo Valley Telephone Company; Conestoga Mobile Systems,
Inc.; Conestoga Wireless Company; Infocore Inc.; and CEI Networks, Inc., each of
which is described below. Conestoga's subsidiary, Conestoga Telephone, owns a
10.951% interest in PenTeleData Limited Partnership I.

     Conestoga Telephone and Buffalo Valley are incumbent local exchange
carriers that furnish communications services, mainly local and toll telephone
service, in their respective service areas. Conestoga Telephone serves an area
of approximately 300 square miles that includes portions of Berks, Chester,
Lancaster, and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania. Buffalo Valley serves an
area of approximately 275 square miles in Union and Northumberland counties in
Pennsylvania. Both Companies' services are distributed through their telephone
exchanges and systems of overhead and underground wire and cables. Conestoga
Telephone's and Buffalo Valley's entire telephone systems are digitally
equipped. The population of Conestoga Telephone's service area is estimated to
be 123,550, with an average annual growth rate of .7%. The population of Buffalo
Valley's service area is estimated to be 37,150, with an average annual growth
rate of .4%.

     Conestoga Telephone was incorporated on August 20, 1902 and the original
Buffalo Valley was incorporated on September 13, 1904. Conestoga acquired
Buffalo Valley on May 31, 1996. Both are incorporated in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission, which franchised and established their geographical service
areas. Within their areas, at the present time, they are not in competition with
any other company in providing local exchange telephone service. They are
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission with
respect to interstate services.

     Conestoga acquired Infocore on April 30, 1997. Infocore is a diversified
telecommunications service company founded in 1981, that designs, installs and
maintains telephone systems and resells local exchange and toll services.
Conestoga Wireless was formed on March 17, 1995 as a limited liability company,
owned 60% by Conestoga and 40% by Infocore. The limited liability company was
merged into a corporation by the same name on January 1, 1998, and Conestoga now
owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Conestoga Wireless, the surviving
corporation. Conestoga Wireless began providing digital wireless
telecommunication, called personal communications services, in Eastern and
Central Pennsylvania in May 1998, pursuant to Federal Communications Commission
personal communications services licenses. D&E Communications and Conestoga have
agreed to pursue a sale of Conestoga's wireless operations and, due to
pre-existing commitments, the combined company may be required shortly after the
merger to dispose of that portion of Conestoga's wireless operations conducted
in the Reading, Pennsylvania market. See "The Merger Agreement -- Sale of
Conestoga's Wireless Operations" on page 66 and "Description of D&E
Communications" on pages 93 through 94.

     Northern Communications, Inc. was organized in March 1981 as a nonregulated
commercial enterprise operated for the resale of long distance service. During
1997, Northern Communications' name was changed to Conestoga Communications,
Inc. and it began operations as a full-service interexchange carrier. During
1998, Conestoga Communications began operations as a competitive local exchange
carrier, operating in adjacent Bell of Pennsylvania territories. Effective
December 31, 2000, Conestoga Communications was merged into TeleBeam and the
name of the surviving corporation was changed to CEI Networks, Inc.

     Conestoga acquired TeleBeam on January 31, 2000. The transaction was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, which accordingly required restatement
of the financial statements. All financial information presented for current and
prior periods includes the results of TeleBeam. TeleBeam Inc. was founded in
1992, as a Pennsylvania corporation, and is headquartered in State College,
Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2000, Telebeam's name was changed to CEI
Networks, Inc. CEI Networks has developed a broadband fiber network to provide
multiple communications services to customers in central Pennsylvania as a
bundled package through one service delivery venue. CEI Networks provides a
variety of individual and bundled

services to its customers, including long distance voice services, Internet
access and high-speed data transport, video and other enhanced communications
services to business and multi-dwelling-unit residential customers.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On December 3, 2001, in connection with the termination of its merger
agreement with NTELOS, Conestoga paid to NTELOS, in accordance with the terms of
the NTELOS merger agreement, a termination fee in the amount of $10 million.

                       DESCRIPTION OF D&E COMMUNICATIONS

     D&E Communications is an integrated communications provider that provides
communications services and equipment to customers in south-central Pennsylvania
and in certain parts of Eastern Europe. We provide both local and long distance
services including enhanced calling features, high-speed data services and
Internet access services. In addition, we offer systems integration and repair
services and sell and install communications equipment such as telephone systems
and data communications products. Our business can generally be categorized into
the following five segments:

     - incumbent local exchange carrier;

     - competitive local exchange carrier;

     - systems integration;

     - internet services; and

     - wireless services.

     A brief description of each of our business segments follows:

     Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier.  Through Denver and Ephrata Telephone &
Telegraph Company, our wholly owned subsidiary, we furnish telephone services
through approximately 62,000 access lines to an estimated population of over
100,000 throughout Berks, Lancaster and Lebanon Counties in Pennsylvania. The
telephone services furnished include local and long distance network services,
custom calling features, directory publication and billing and collection
services.

     Competitive Local Exchange Carrier.  Through D&E Systems, Inc. (which does
business as D&E Communications), our wholly owned subsidiary, we provide
telecommunications services in markets adjacent to those traditionally served by
us as an incumbent local exchange carrier.

     Systems Integration.  Through D&E Networks, Inc., our wholly owned
subsidiary, we provide computer networking services and operate a retail store
that specializes in the sale of communications equipment such as telephones and
accessories. We also sell, install and maintain telecommunications equipment
primarily to and for business customers in central and eastern Pennsylvania.

     Internet Services.  Through D&E Jazzd, we operate as an Internet service
provider in offering internet access and web page hosting services.

     Wireless Services.  Through D&E Wireless, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of D&E Communications, we design, construct and provide personal
communications services (PCS). D&E Wireless derives a substantial part of its
revenues from providing support services to D&E/Omnipoint Wireless Joint
Venture, L.P. (which does business as PCS One), a joint venture with affiliates
of VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in which we hold a 50% interest, in the four
Pennsylvania markets of Lancaster, Harrisburg, York-Hanover and Reading. In
October 2001, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in PCS One to
affiliates of VoiceStream. Pursuant to non-competition covenants in the
VoiceStream agreement, for three years following the sale of its interest in PCS
One, D&E Communications may be restricted from providing mobile voice wireless
communications services in the Pennsylvania markets of York-Hanover, Harrisburg,
Lancaster or Reading. In addition, if within such three-year period D&E
Communications acquires a business that is engaged in the provision of such
services in these markets, such as Conestoga, we may be required to divest our
interest in such business or otherwise cease providing such services.

     International.  Through D&E Investments, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary,
we provide support services to Pilicka Telephonia S.A., a telecommunications
company that provides telephone service in a region of Poland through a system
using fixed wireless and wireline technologies. We currently hold a 33% indirect
interest in Pilicka Telephonia.

     We are a Pennsylvania corporation with principal executive offices located
at 124 East Main Street, Ephrata, Pennsylvania 17522. Our telephone number is
(717) 733-4101. Our common stock is traded through the facilities of the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol "DECC."

     For additional information regarding our business, please see our Annual
Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, which are incorporated
herein by reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On October 17, 2001, D&E Wireless, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of D&E
Communications, and affiliates of VoiceStream Wireless Corporation entered into
a definitive agreement to sell D&E Wireless, Inc.'s 50% joint venture interest
in D&E/Omnipoint Wireless Joint Venture, L.P. (which does business as PCS One)
to VoiceStream for approximately $117 million. The sale is subject to regulatory
approval and other customary closing conditions. D&E Communications expects the
transaction to close in the first or second quarter of 2002.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The legality of D&E Communications' common stock to be issued in connection
with the merger will be passed upon by Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. Certain

LLC. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, counsel for D&E Communications, will deliver
opinions to D&E Communications and Conestoga concerning various federal income
tax consequences of the merger. See "The Merger -- Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences" on pages 47 through 52.

                   SUBMISSION OF FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

CONESTOGA

     As a result of the merger, Conestoga does not currently expect to hold a
2002 annual meeting of shareholders because Conestoga will have become a wholly
owned subsidiary of D&E Communications in the merger. If unexpectedly, however,
the annual meeting is held, Conestoga shareholders may propose matters to be
presented at the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders and may also nominate
persons to be directors of Conestoga. Any shareholder proposal intended for
inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders
must be received by Conestoga no later than                , addressed to the
Secretary of Conestoga at the address on the front cover of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Shareholders submitting proposals are urged to submit
their proposals by certified mail, return receipt requested.

     Shareholder proposals to be included in the proxy statement for the 2002
annual meeting as well as proposed shareholder nominations for the election of
directors at the 2002 annual meeting must each comply with advance notice
procedures set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC and the
requirements set forth in Conestoga's By-laws, respectively, in order to be
brought properly before that meeting. See "Comparison of Shareholders
Rights -- Advance Notice of Nominations of Directors." In general, written
notice of a director nomination must be delivered to the Secretary of Conestoga
not less than 15 days prior to the annual meeting of shareholders.

     In addition to the timing requirements, the advance notice provisions of
Conestoga's By-laws contain informational content requirements that also must be
met. A copy of the By-law provisions governing these timing procedures and
content requirements may be obtained by writing to the Secretary of Conestoga.

     Unless shareholder proposals meet the requirements set forth above, the
persons named in the proxies solicited on behalf of the Conestoga board of
directors will have discretionary authority to vote on and may vote against any
such shareholder proposal.

D&E COMMUNICATIONS

     Shareholder proposals that are intended to be presented at D&E
Communications' 2002 annual meeting of shareholders must be received on or prior
to                to be eligible for inclusion in D&E Communications' proxy
statement and form of proxy to be used in connection with the 2002 annual
meeting. These proposals must also meet the requirements set forth in the rules
and regulations of the SEC in order to be eligible for inclusion in D&E
Communications' proxy statement for its 2002 annual meeting of shareholders.

                      WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

                      THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING

     1.1 The Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 below), the Company and Newco
shall, in accordance with the PBCL, consummate a merger (the "MERGER") in which
the Company shall be merged with and into Newco and the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. In lieu of the Company being
merged with and into Newco, if all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(excluding the condition set forth in Section 7.1(h) and

any conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date
(as hereinafter defined)) have been satisfied or waived, and if, based on a
reasonable good faith determination, the combination of (a) the trading price of
Parent Common Stock (as defined in Section 5.2 below) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (by taking into account the Reorganization Assumption (as defined
in Section 6.11 below)), (b) the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration (plus
the aggregate amount of cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent
Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(e) hereof) received by holders of Company Shares
(as defined in Section 3.1 below) in the Merger and (c) the aggregate amount
paid to holders of the Company's Preferred Stock in connection with any
redemption by the Company of such shares (the "REDEMPTION AMOUNT") could result
in an amount exceeding 60% of the combination of (i) the Redemption Amount and
(ii) the total fair market value of the aggregate consideration payable and
deliverable to the holders of Company Stock as a result of the Merger (such
circumstance described above being referred to herein as a "REVERSE MERGER
CIRCUMSTANCE"), then the "Merger" shall automatically be a merger of Newco with
and into the Company at the Effective Time, in which case, as a consequence of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Newco shall thereupon cease. The
corporation surviving the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION." In accordance with Section 1929 of the PBCL, all of the
rights, privileges, powers, immunities, purposes and franchises of Newco and the
Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of Newco and the Company shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The
parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a Reverse Merger
Circumstance, the Merger is not intended to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

     1.2 Effective Time.  As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, the appropriate
parties hereto shall execute in the manner required by the PBCL and file with
the Pennsylvania Department of State articles of merger relating to the Merger,
and the parties shall take such other and further actions as may be required by
Law (as defined in Section 4.13 below) to make the Merger effective. The time
the Merger becomes effective in accordance with applicable Law is hereinafter
referred to as the "EFFECTIVE TIME."

     1.3 Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 1929 of the PBCL.

     1.4 Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Barley, Snyder, Senft & Cohen, LLC, 501 Washington Street,
Reading, Pennsylvania 19603, at 10:00 a.m. on the first business day following
the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof
shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such
other place, time and date as Parent and the Company may agree.

                                 ARTICLE II --

                             SURVIVING CORPORATION

     2.1 Articles of Incorporation.  In the absence of a Reverse Merger
Circumstance, from and after the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation

in accordance with the PBCL; provided, however, that Article I of such Articles
of Incorporation shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The name
of this Corporation is "Conestoga Enterprises, Inc." In the event of a Reverse
Merger Circumstance, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall be the
