greater, then the number of shares of Cerner Common Stock to be registered shall be an amount equal to 362,791 times a
fraction, the numerator of which is $64.50 and the denominator of which is the average of the closing sales price of Cerner
Common Stock during such 15 trading day period. In accordance with Rule 416, this registration statement also shall register

effective date until the registrant shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this
registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of
1933 or until the registration statement shall become effective on such date as the Commission, acting pursuant to
said Section 8(a), may determine.

PROSPECTUS OF

PROXY STATEMENT OF

CERNER CORPORATION

DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

MERGER PROPOSED  YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

To the Shareholders of Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc.

     The boards of
directors of Cerner Corporation and Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc. have
approved a merger agreement that would result in Cerner acquiring Dynamic. The
merger offers Dynamic shareholders the opportunity to become shareholders of
Cerner, a more significant provider of information systems to the healthcare
industry. Dynamic believes the combination of these two companies will result
in an opportunity to create substantially more shareholder value than could be
achieved by Dynamic individually.

     If we complete the merger, Dynamic shareholders will receive a number of
shares of Cerner common stock equal to 362,791 divided by the number of Dynamic
common shares issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the date
that all of the conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived.
However, there is one exception. If the average of the closing sales price of
Cerner common stock during the 15 consecutive trading day period ending on the
first trading day immediately prior to the date that all of the conditions to
the merger have been satisfied or waived is $64.50 or greater then the Dynamic
shareholders will receive for each Dynamic common share that number of shares
of Cerner common stock equal to:



362,791 divided by the number of Dynamic common shares issued and
outstanding on the date that all of the conditions to the merger have
been satisfied or waived, multiplied by



a fraction, the numerator of which is $64.50 and the denominator of
which is the average of the closing sales price of Cerner common stock
during such 15 day trading period.

                  Dynamic cannot complete the merger unless the shareholders holding a
majority of the outstanding Dynamic common shares approve it. Dynamic will
hold a meeting of its shareholders to vote on the merger. 
Your vote is very
important. Whether or not you plan to attend the shareholder meeting, please
vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us. 
If you sign,
date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your
proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the merger. Not returning your
proxy card or not instructing your broker how to vote shares held for you in
street name will have the same effect as voting those shares against the
merger.

The date, time and place of the meeting is:

     This document provides you with detailed information about the proposed
merger. Dynamic encourages you to read this entire document carefully.

WHAT DYNAMIC SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER

     We refer to the number of shares of Cerner common stock into which one
Dynamic common share will be converted in the merger as the exchange ratio.
If we complete the merger, Dynamic holders of common shares will receive an
aggregate of 362,791 shares of Cerner common stock, unless the average of the
closing sales price of Cerner common stock during the 15 consecutive trading
day period ending immediately prior to the date that all conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived is $64.50 or greater. The number of shares of
Cerner common stock that will be issued with respect to each Dynamic common
share will be determined as follows:



if the average of the closing sales price of Cerner common
stock during the 15 consecutive trading day period ending immediately
prior to the date that all conditions to the merger are satisfied or
waived is less than $64.50, then the number of shares of Cerner
common stock that a Dynamic shareholder will receive for each Dynamic
common share will be an amount equal to 362,791 divided by the number
of issued and outstanding Dynamic common shares; or



if the average of the closing sales price of Cerner common
stock during such 15 trading day period is $64.50 or greater, then
the number of shares of Cerner common stock that a Dynamic
shareholder will receive for each Dynamic common share will be an
amount equal to (a) 362,791 divided by the number of issued and
outstanding Dynamic common shares, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the
numerator of which is $64.50 and the denominator of which is the
average of the closing sales price of Cerner common stock during such
15 trading day period.

     Illustrations of the calculation of the exchange ratio are provided below,
assuming there are 6,593,216 Dynamic common shares issued and outstanding on
the effective date of the merger (which is the number of shares issued and
outstanding on October 16, 2001).

     Because the trading price of Cerner common stock varies, the actual market
value of the Cerner common stock you receive as merger consideration may differ
from the calculated value of the merger consideration shown above, which is
provided here for illustrative purposes only.

     Each share of Dynamic preferred stock will be redeemed at a price per
share equal to $2.00 in cash, plus all unpaid accrued dividends which the
holders of such preferred shares are entitled to receive.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING

Q:

 Why are the two companies proposing to merge?

A:  

We believe the proposed merger is in the best interests of both of the companies and their respective shareholders. The
board of directors of Cerner believes that the merger will result in an addition to Cerners significant pathology,
laboratory and radiology client base that primarily consists of larger hospitals, health systems and independent
laboratories. The board of directors of Dynamic believes the merger provides significant value to Dynamic shareholders,
provides them with greater liquidity for their investment, and enables them to participate in the opportunities for growth
offered by Cerner.

You should review the reasons for the merger described in greater detail at pages        through       .

Q: 

 When and where is the special meeting?

A: 

The Dynamic special meeting is scheduled to take place on                            , 2001, at              local time, at
                           .

Q: 

 When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:  

We expect to complete the merger promptly after receiving shareholder approval at the special meeting.

Q: 

 What do I need to do now?

A:  

You should carefully read and consider the information contained in this document. Then, please fill out, sign and mail
your proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the special
meeting. If the card is signed, dated and mailed, but does not specify a choice, it will be voted FOR approval of the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q: 

 What if I dont vote or I abstain from voting?

A: 

If you do not vote or you abstain from voting, the effect will be a vote against the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q:  

If my shares are held by my broker in street name, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:  

Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions
provided by your broker to vote your shares. If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your
shares held in street name, your broker will not be permitted to vote your shares, which will have the effect of a vote
against the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q: 

 May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A:  

Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. You can do this in one of
three ways. First, you can send a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can
complete and submit a new proxy card. If you choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation
or your new proxy card to Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc., at 615 Crescent Executive Court, Fifth Floor, Lake Mary,
Florida 32746, Attention: Brian Greco, Corporate Secretary, prior to the vote of the shareholders at the Special Meeting to
be held on                                                , 2001. Third, you can attend the special meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the
meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy; you must request a ballot and vote the ballot at the meeting. If you have
instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions received from your broker to change your vote.

Q:  

Are Dynamic shareholders entitled to dissenters rights?

A:  

No. Under Florida law, Dynamic shareholders are not entitled to dissenters rights of appraisal or other rights to demand
fair value for their shares in cash by reason of the merger.

- 2 -



Q: 

 Should I send in my stock certificate now?

A: 

No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging your stock certificates for
certificates of Cerner common stock and the cash consideration for any fractional shares of Dynamic common stock.

Q: 

 Who can I call with questions about the special meeting or the merger?

A: 

If you have any questions about the merger, or if you need additional copies of the proxy statement/prospectus or the
enclosed proxy, you can contact Brian Greco, Corporate Secretary of Dynamic, at (407) 333-5300.

SUMMARY

This Summary, together with the preceding Question and Answer section,
highlights selected information from this proxy statement/prospectus and may
not contain all the information that is important to you. To better understand
the merger and related transactions and for a more complete description of the
legal terms of the merger and related transactions, you should carefully read

The Companies

Cerner Corporation

2800 Rockcreek Parkway

North Kansas City, Missouri 64117

(816) 221-1024

     Cerner, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1980, is a leading supplier
of clinical and management information and knowledge systems to healthcare
organizations worldwide. Cerners mission is to connect the appropriate
persons, knowledge and resources at the appropriate time and location to
achieve the optimal health outcome.

Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc.

615 Crescent Executive Court

Fifth Floor

Lake Mary, Florida 32746

(407) 333-5300

     Dynamic, a Florida corporation incorporated in 1977, is a provider of NT,
UNIX and AS/400 based diagnostic workflow solutions for pathology, laboratory
and radiology departments in approximately 640 customer sites, most located in
the United States. Dynamics information systems contribute to higher quality
and more cost-effective delivery of care and make it possible to have access to
information across the entire continuum of care.

The Merger

     We have attached a copy of the Agreement and Plan of Merger to this
document as Appendix A. We encourage you to read this merger agreement as it
is the legal document that governs the merger.

Vote Required (see pages       through      )

     The affirmative vote of a majority of each of Dynamics outstanding
classes of equity, the common shares and the preferred shares, voting as a
separate class must approve the merger. As of the Dynamic record date,
directors and executive officers of Dynamic owned or controlled approximately
          Dynamic common shares, entitling them to exercise approximately           % of
the voting power of the Dynamic common shares entitled to vote at the Dynamic
special meeting. In addition, at the time the merger agreement was entered
into by Dynamic and Cerner, certain holders affiliated with directors of
Dynamic that beneficially own in excess of a majority of the Dynamic preferred
shares entered into a shareholder agreement with Cerner to vote their preferred
shares in favor of the merger and have furnished Cerner with an irrevocable
proxy to ensure such vote. A copy of the shareholder agreement is attached to
this document as Appendix C.

Our Reasons for the Merger (see pages       through      )

     We are proposing to merge because we believe that:



by combining the companies we can create a stronger company that will
provide benefits to both our shareholders and customers; and



the merger will strengthen the combined companys position as a
competitor in the healthcare information management industry, which is
rapidly changing and growing more competitive.

     In reaching its conclusions, the board of directors of Dynamic considered
a number of factors, including:



the anticipated merger consideration to be received by its
shareholders in relation to book value, market value, and earnings per
Dynamic common share,



the available alternatives to enhance shareholder value,



the opportunity for shareholders to realize a premium over recent
historical market prices for the shares in a tax free exchange,



the business, operations, financial condition, and future prospects
of Dynamic as a stand alone company, including the attendant risks of
such a strategy,



an evaluation of the potential long-term prospects of Cerner,



the complementary nature of the products offered by each of the

Dynamics Board of Directors Recommends that Dynamics Shareholders Approve the Merger and Related Transactions (see pages            through      )

     The Dynamic board of directors believes that the merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby are fair to you and in your best interests
and recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

What Dynamics Shareholders Will Receive (see page      )

     If we complete the merger, the number of shares of Cerner common stock
that a Dynamic shareholder will receive for each Dynamic common share will be
an amount equal to 362,791 divided by the number of Dynamic common shares
issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the date that all of the
conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived, unless the average of
the closing sales price of Cerner common stock during the 15 consecutive
trading day period ending immediately preceding the date that all conditions of
the merger have been satisfied or waived is $64.50 or greater, in which case
the Dynamic common shareholders will receive for each Dynamic common share that
number of shares of Cerner common stock equal to (a) 362,791 divided by the
number of Dynamic common shares issued and outstanding on the date that all
conditions of the merger have been satisfied or waived multiplied by (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is $64.50 and the denominator of which is the
average of the closing sales price of Cerner common stock during such 15
trading day period. Cerner will not issue any fractional shares in the merger.
Instead, you will receive a small cash payment equal to the value of any
fractional shares that otherwise would have been issued to you.

     Each share of Dynamic preferred stock will be redeemed at a price per
share equal to $2.00 in cash, plus all unpaid accrued dividends to which
holders of such preferred shares are entitled to receive.

     Following the merger, you will be entitled to exchange your Dynamic common
shares for shares of Cerner common stock by sending your Dynamic common share
certificates, and a form for exchanging the shares that we will send to you, to
Cerners exchange agent, UMB Bank, n.a. Upon receipt of these documents, the
exchange agent will exchange your Dynamic common shares for shares of Cerner
common stock at the applicable exchange ratio. For more information on this
procedure, see THE MERGER  Exchange of Stock Certificates on page     .

Federal Income Tax Consequences (see pages       through      )

     We expect that the holders of Dynamic common shares generally will not
recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
your exchange of Dynamic common shares for shares of Cerner common stock. You
may, however, have to recognize gain or loss in connection with cash received
in payment for any fractional share that may result from the exchange ratio of
the merger. In addition, holders of the Dynamic preferred shares that are
redeemed for cash in connection with the merger  may have to recognize income, gain or loss in connection with such
payment. The income tax treatment described above may not apply to all Dynamic
common and preferred shareholders. Determining the actual income tax
consequences of the merger to you can be complicated. You should consult your
own tax advisor for a full understanding of the mergers tax consequences that
are particular to you. We will not be obligated to complete the merger unless
we receive a legal opinion, dated the closing date, that the merger will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. In that case, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of the merger will be as we have described it above. This
opinion, however, will not bind the Internal Revenue Service, which could take
a different view.

No Dissenters Rights (see page      )

     Dynamic is incorporated under Florida law and under applicable Florida law
Dynamic shareholders will not have any right of appraisal or other rights to
demand fair value for their shares in cash in connection with the merger.

Opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation (see pages       through      )

     In deciding to approve the merger, the Dynamic board considered the
opinion from SG Cowen Securities Corporation as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view to the holders of Dynamic common shares, of the
exchange ratio at which Dynamic common shares will be converted into shares of
Cerner common stock pursuant to the merger. A copy of this opinion is attached
as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus.

- 5 -



Conditions to the Merger (see pages       through      )

     The completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction of a number of
conditions, including the following:



approval by Dynamics shareholders;



the continued accuracy of each companys representations and warranties and compliance by each company with its agreements
contained in the merger agreement;



receipt of a legal opinion from Cerners counsel as to the tax consequences of the merger;



the average of the closing sales price of Cerner common stock for the 15 consecutive trading day period ending immediately
prior to the closing date of the merger is $43.00 or more;



receipt of any required regulatory approvals;



there being no legal action or court order that prohibits the merger; and



there having not been a material adverse change in the financial condition or assets of either Cerner or Dynamic.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see pages       through      )

     Cerner and Dynamic can agree to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger even if Dynamics shareholders have approved it. Also,
either of us can terminate the merger agreement on our own without completing
the merger under various circumstances, including:



if the merger has not been consummated by February 28, 2002;



if there is any law that makes consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited;



if the Dynamic shareholders do not approve the merger on or before February 28, 2002; or



if the other company has materially breached its representations, warranties or obligations under the merger agreement.

     In addition, Cerner may decide not to complete the merger if (a) Dynamics
board of directors changes, in a manner adverse to Cerner, its recommendation
that Dynamics shareholders approve the merger, (b) Dynamic has entered into an
agreement to be acquired by another party or if the Dynamic board or committee
of the board approves such a transaction to be acquired, or (c) a tender offer
or exchange offer for the common stock of Dynamic has been commenced and
Dynamic has not sent to its shareholders, within ten business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement that Dynamic
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer. Similarly, Dynamic may
decide not to complete the merger if it receives an acquisition proposal from
another party that the Dynamic board believes is superior to the merger, or
Cerner does not close the merger within 15 business days after all conditions
to its obligation to close have been satisfied, other than the condition that
the average of the closing sales price of Cerner common stock for the 15
consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the date that all other
conditions are satisfied is $43.00 or more.

Termination Fees; Liquidated Damages and Expenses (see page      )

     Dynamic is required to pay Cerner a termination fee of $2,000,000 if:



Dynamic terminates the merger agreement or modifies or withdraws its
recommendation of the merger and merger agreement because it received
an acquisition proposal from another party that the Dynamic board
believes is superior to the merger; or



Cerner terminates the merger agreement because Dynamic (1) modified or
withdrew its recommendation of the merger and merger agreement, (2)
breached its obligations under certain provisions of the merger
agreement relating to other acquisition proposals or the Dynamic
recommendation of the merger and merger agreement, (3) approved an
acquisition proposal from another party, or (4) failed to recommend to
its shareholders rejection of a third party tender or exchange offer
within ten business days after commencement of such offer, or (5)
Dynamics directors have resolved to do any of the foregoing.

     In addition, if each of the conditions to a partys obligation to
consummate the merger under the merger agreement has been satisfied and that
party does not perform its obligation to consummate the merger pursuant to the
merger agreement, then that party is required to pay the other party liquidated
damages in the amount of $2,000,000.

Dynamic Stock Options and Warrants (see page      )

     If we complete the merger, each option and warrant to acquire Dynamic
common shares that is outstanding and unexercised immediately before completing
the

-6-



merger will become an option or warrant to purchase Cerner common stock.
The number of shares of Cerner common stock subject to such options and
warrants, as well as the exercise prices, will be adjusted to account for the
exchange ratio in the merger. Additionally, certain stock options held by
Dynamic directors, officers, and employees contain provisions that cause the
options to become fully vested upon a change in control. Therefore, those
options will vest as a result of the merger, but cannot be exercised until 12
months after the original date of grant. The options, as adjusted, will
continue to be governed by the terms of the Dynamic stock option plans and the
agreements under which such options were granted.

We May Amend the Terms of the Merger Agreement and Waive Rights Under the Merger Agreement (see page      )

     We may jointly amend the terms of the merger agreement, and either party
may waive its right to require the other party to adhere to any of those terms,
to the extent legally permissible. However, after the Dynamic shareholders
approve the merger agreement, they must approve any amendment or waiver that
would require such approval under any applicable law.

Stock Option Agreement (see pages ___)

     As a condition to the merger agreement, Dynamic granted Cerner an option
to purchase up to 985,746 Dynamic common shares at an exercise price of $3.00
per share. Cerner may exercise this option upon the occurrence of certain
events that are ordinarily associated with another party attempting to break
up the merger and acquire Dynamic. As of this date, none of those events have
occurred. The stock option, if exercised, would equal 15% of the total number
of outstanding Dynamic common shares as of its date of exercise. The purpose
of the stock option is to increase the likelihood that the merger will occur by
making it more difficult for another party to acquire Dynamic. A copy of the
stock option agreement is attached to this document as Appendix D.

Dynamic Officers and Directors Have Some Interests in the Merger That Are Different From or in Addition to Their Interests as Shareholders (see pages      
through      )

     Dynamic directors and officers have interests in the merger in addition to
their interest as common shareholders of Dynamic. These interests exist
because of employment and/or other agreements that Dynamic officers have
entered into with Dynamic or Cerner and rights that Dynamic officers and
directors have under certain benefit and compensation plans maintained by
Dynamic.

     Following the merger, the combined company will indemnify, and provide
directors and officers insurance for, the officers and directors of Dynamic for
events occurring before the merger, including events that are related to the
merger.

     In addition, some of the Dynamic directors and some of its former officers
and directors also are the holders or beneficial owners of Dynamic preferred
stock and they or the entities that they represent will receive a cash payment
for their preferred stock in connection with the redemption of the preferred
shares under the terms of the merger agreement.

     The Dynamic board of directors knew about these additional interests, and
considered them, when it approved the merger agreement.

Certain Differences in the Rights of Shareholders (see pages       through      )

     Once the merger occurs, Dynamic common shareholders will automatically
become shareholders of Cerner and their rights will be governed by Delaware law
and Cerners corporate governance documents rather than Florida law and
Dynamics corporate governance documents, including its articles of
incorporation and bylaws.

Comparative Market Price Information (see pages       through      )

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     This table should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for Cerner and the historical
consolidated financial statements for Dynamic incorporated by reference and
contained herein. Pro forma combined and equivalent pro forma per share data
reflect the combined results of Cerner and Dynamic presented as though they
were one company for all periods shown. The acquisition of Dynamic will be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price of
$22.9 million using the five day average of Cerners stock price surrounding the
announcement of the merger on September 6, 2001, has been allocated to the
assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values with the resulting
amount of goodwill of $5.2 million. Such allocations are preliminary and are
subject to final determination. In accordance with the recently issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 141, Business
Combinations, goodwill will not amortized, but will be subject to periodic
tests for impairment. All Dynamic per share data has been adjusted to reflect
the Dynamic 1-for-3 reverse stock split effective June 28, 2001. All amounts
are unaudited.

RISK FACTORS

     You should carefully consider the following risk factors concerning Cerner
in determining whether to vote to approve the merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby. This proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking
statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The words could, should,
will be, will lead, will assist, intended, continue, believe,
may, expect, hope, anticipate, goal, forecast and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We
caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Cerners actual results could differ materially from the
forward-looking statements. The risk factors described below could cause or
contribute to these differences and apply to all forward-looking statements
wherever they appear in this proxy statement/prospectus. However, there could
be other factors not listed below that may affect Cerner. We may not update
these risk factors or publicly announce revisions to forward-looking statements
contained in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Quarterly operating results of Cerner may vary. 
Cerners quarterly
operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future
periods. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons
including demand for Cerners products and services, Cerners long sales cycle,
the long installation and implementation cycle for these larger, more complex
and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere
in this document. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for
Cerners HNA Millennium products, a large percentage of Cerners revenues are
generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and costlier
systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a
significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources
by the client. The sale may be subject to delays due to clients internal
budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by
competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies
or personnel resources. Delays in the expected sale or installation of these
large contracts may have a significant impact on Cerners anticipated quarterly
revenues and consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of
Cerners expenses are relatively fixed.

     These larger, more complex and costlier systems are installed and
implemented over time periods ranging from approximately six months to three
years and involve significant efforts both by Cerner and the client. In
addition, implementation of Cerners HNA Millennium products is a new and
evolving process. Cerner recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard
milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter
depends upon Cerners and the clients ability to meet these project
milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of
the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift
of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material
adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter. In addition,
support payments by clients for Cerners products generally do not commence
until the product is in use.

     Cerners revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the
first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year.

Cerners stock price may be volatile. 
The trading price of Cerners
common stock may be volatile. The market for Cerners common stock may
experience significant price and volume fluctuations
in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated
quarterly variations in operating results, changes in expectations of future
financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts,
governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client relationship
developments and other factors, many of which are beyond Cerners control.

     Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software,
healthcare and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme
volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of
particular

-15-



companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may
adversely affect the trading price of Cerners common stock, regardless of
actual operating performance.

Market risk may affect Cerners investment holdings and results of
operations. 
Cerner accounts for its investments in equity securities which
have readily determinable fair values as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates
over which Cerner exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity
method. Investments in other equity securities are reported at cost. All
equity securities are reviewed by Cerner for declines in fair value. If such
declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the
individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the
amount of the write-down is included in earnings.

     As of June 30, 2001, Cerner owned 14,820,527 shares of common stock of
WebMD Corporation, which as of June 30, 2001 had a cost basis of $85.8 million
and a carrying value of $103.7 million as these shares are accounted for as
available-for-sale. 2,000,000 shares of the shares of WebMD held by Cerner are
not registered. At June 30, 2001, Cerner also held 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD
with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of
$4.1 million. The warrants are carried at cost, as they do not have a fair
value that is currently available on a securities exchange.

     On June 18, 2001 Cerner reached an agreement with WebMD regarding certain
performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage arising out
of the original license transaction between Cerner and CareInsite, Inc., which
has been merged into WebMD. Under the agreement, Cerner received 2,000,000
shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11.6 million, in exchange for $432,000 in
cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to Cerner by WebMD. As a
result of this agreement, Cerner recognized a non-recurring gain of $4.8
million, net of $2.7 million in tax. Cerners policy is to review declines in
fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other
than temporary. As a result of this policy, during the second quarter of 2001,
Cerner recorded a write-down of its investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79.
Accordingly, Cerner recognized a charge to earnings of $81.4 million, net of
$46.2 million in tax.

     At June 30, 2001, marketable securities (which consist of money market and
commercial paper) of Cerner were recorded at cost, which approximates fair
value of approximately $98 million, with an overall average return of
approximately 5% and an overall weighted maturity of less than 90 days. The
marketable securities held by Cerner are not subject to price risk as a result
of the short-term nature of the investments.

     Cerner is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures
from changes in interest rates on long-term debt since 100% of its long-term
debt is at a fixed rate. To date, Cerner has not entered into any derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

     Cerner conducts business in several foreign jurisdictions. However, the
business transacted is in the local functional currency and Cerner does not
currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or
losses. All other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, Cerner
has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign
currency risk.

Changes in the healthcare industry may adversely affect Cerner. 
The
healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political,
economic and regulatory influences. For example, the Balanced Budget Act of
1997 (Public Law 105-32) contains significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid
and began to have its initial impact in 1998 due to limitations on
reimbursement, resulting cost containment initiatives, and effects on pricing and demand for
capital intensive systems. In addition, the issued and pending rules under the
Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), will
have a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and
standardized transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures
in order to ensure the protection of patient health information. These factors
affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations.
Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform
or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to
change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These programs may
contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower
reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare
industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by
reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including
investments in Cerners products and services.

     Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated
healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try
to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for Cerners products
and services.

-16-



As the healthcare industry consolidates, Cerners client base
could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the
importance of acquiring each client becomes greater.

Significant competition may adversely affect Cerner. 
The market for
healthcare information systems is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and
subject to rapid technological change. Cerner believes that the principal
competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system
and product offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the
features and capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for
the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible products.

     Certain of Cerners competitors have greater financial, technical, product
development, marketing and other resources than Cerner and some of its
competitors offer products that it does not offer. Cerners principal existing
competitors include Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, IDX
Systems Corporation, McKesson HBOC, Inc. and Eclipsys Corporation, each of
which offers a suite of products that compete with many of Cerners products.
There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing
products.

     In addition, Cerner expects that major software information systems
companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system
integrators, Internet-based start-up companies and others specializing in the
healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of
change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are
frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry
standards and requirements. As a result, Cerners success will depend upon its
ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely
and cost- effective basis, new and enhanced products that satisfy changing
client requirements and achieve market acceptance.

Proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be
infringed upon. 
Cerner relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright
and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee
nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the trade secrecy
of its proprietary information. Cerner recently initiated a patent program but
currently has a very limited patent portfolio. As a result, Cerner may not be
able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property.

     In addition, Cerner could be subject to intellectual property infringement
claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its products
overlaps with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious,
could be expensive to defend. If Cerner becomes liable to third parties for
infringing their intellectual property rights, it could be required to pay a
substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology, obtain a
license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual
property.

Government regulation could increase the cost of Cerners products. 
The
United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has declared that
software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions
regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood
components for transfusion are medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (Act) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, Cerner is
subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to its blood bank
software. If other of Cerners products are deemed to be actively regulated
medical devices by the FDA, Cerner could be subject to extensive requirements
governing pre- and post- marketing requirements including premarket
notification clearance prior to marketing. Complying with these FDA
regulations would be time consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA
may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in
healthcare.

     Following an inspection by the FDA in March of 1998, Cerner received a
Form FDA 483 (Notice of Inspectional Observations) alleging non-compliance with
certain aspects of FDAs Quality System Regulation with respect to Cerners
PathNet HNAC Blood Bank Transfusion and Donor products (the Blood Bank
Products). Cerner subsequently received a Warning Letter, dated April 29,
1998, as a result of the same inspection. Cerner responded promptly to the FDA
and undertook a number of actions in response to the Form 483 and Warning
Letter including an audit by a third party of Cerners Blood Bank Products and
improvements to Cerners Quality System. A copy of the third party audit was
submitted to the FDA in October of 1998 and, at the request of the FDA,
additional information and clarification were submitted to the FDA in January
of 1999.

     There can be no assurance, however, that Cerners actions taken in
response to the Form 483 and Warning Letter will be deemed adequate by the FDA
or that additional actions on behalf of Cerner will not be required. In
addition, Cerner remains subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be
no assurances that Cerner will not be required to undertake additional actions
to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any
failure by Cerner to

-17-



comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory
requirements could have a material adverse effect on Cerners ability to
continue to manufacture and distribute its products. FDA has many enforcement
tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and/or criminal
prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on
Cerners business, results of operations or financial condition.

Product related liabilities could affect the financial condition of
Cerner. 
Many of Cerners products provide data for use by healthcare providers
in providing care to patients. Although no such claims have been brought
against Cerner to date regarding injuries related to the use of its products,
such claims may be made in the future. Although Cerner maintains product
liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for
its business, there can be no assurance that such coverage will prove to be
adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable
terms, if at all. A successful claim brought against Cerner which is uninsured
or under-insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or
financial condition.

System errors and warranties could cause Cerner to incur additional
expense under contracts. 
Cerners systems, particularly the HNA Millennium
versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others,
Cerners systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced.
Although Cerner conducts extensive testing, it has discovered software errors
in its products after their introduction. Cerners systems are intended for
use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and
treatment of patients. Therefore, users of Cerner products have a greater
sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally.
Cerners agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against
material errors and other matters. Failure of a clients system to meet these
criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the
client to cancel the contract, or could require Cerner to incur additional
expense in order to make the system meet these criteria. Cerners contracts
with its clients generally limit Cerners liability arising from such claims
but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions.

Anti-takeover defenses may delay or prevent the acquisition of Cerner.

Cerners charter, bylaws, shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of
Delaware law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or
preventing an acquisition of Cerner. Such provisions are intended
to encourage any person interested in acquiring Cerner to negotiate with
and obtain the approval of the Board of Directors in connection with any such
transaction. These provisions include (a) a Board of Directors that is
staggered into three classes to serve staggered three-year terms, (b) blank
check preferred stock, (c) supermajority voting provisions, (d) inability of
shareholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting, (e)
limitations on the ability of shareholders to nominate directors or make
proposals at shareholder meetings and (f) triggering the exercisability of
stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis, which may invoke extensive
economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial
ownership of Cerners common stock exceeds a specified threshold. Certain of
these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of Cerner not approved by
the Board of Directors in which shareholders might receive a premium value for
their shares.

DYNAMIC SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting

     This proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed by Dynamic to its
common shareholders on or about            , 2001, and is accompanied by the
notice of the Dynamic special meeting and form of proxy solicited by the board
of directors of Dynamic for use at the Dynamic special meeting, to be held on           ,
2001 at           , local time, at           ,           , Florida,
and at any adjournments or postponements of that meeting. At the Dynamic
special meeting, you will be asked to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by that agreement, including the merger, and
to act on any other matters that may be properly submitted to a vote at the
Dynamic special meeting.

Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

     The Dynamic board of directors has fixed the close of business on            ,
2001 as the record date for the determination of the Dynamic common
shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Dynamic special meeting.
On that date, there were           Dynamic common shares outstanding held by
approximately        holders of record. A majority of the shares of Dynamic
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date must be
represented in person or by proxy at Dynamics special meeting in order for a
quorum to be present for purposes of transacting business at the meeting. In
the event that a quorum is not present at the meeting, it is expected that the
meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Each
Dynamic common share outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote on
each matter to be considered at Dynamics special meeting.

Vote Required

     Under Florida law, the approval of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least a majority of the outstanding Dynamic common shares entitled to
vote at the Dynamic special meeting. Accordingly, the failure to vote your
Dynamic common shares in favor of the merger for any reason whatsoever 
whether by withholding the vote, by abstaining, or by causing a broker non-vote
 will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement. 
Because
approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes
entitled to be cast at the Dynamic special meeting, the Dynamic board of
directors urges you to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and
return it promptly in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope. 
Shareholders of
Cerner are not required to approve the merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby.

     A broker non-vote generally occurs when a broker who holds shares in
street name (i.e., in the name of a broker, bank of other record holder) for
a customer does not have the authority to vote on certain non-routine matters
because the customer has not provided any voting instructions with respect to
the matter.

     In order to take action on any other matter that is properly submitted to
Dynamic shareholders at a meeting where a quorum is present, the votes cast in
favor of the action must exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the
articles of incorporation or Florida law requires a greater number of votes.
All abstentions and broker non-votes represented at the meeting will be counted
as present for determining the presence of a quorum; but since they are neither
a vote cast in favor of, nor votes cast opposing, a proposed action,
abstentions and broker non-votes typically will have no impact on the outcome
of the matter and will not be counted as a vote cast on such matter.

Security Ownership of Management

     As of the Dynamic record date, directors and executive officers of Dynamic
owned or controlled approximately            Dynamic common shares, entitling
them to exercise approximately            % of the voting power of the Dynamic common
shares entitled to vote at the Dynamic special meeting.

Voting of Proxies

Submitting Proxies. 
Dynamic shareholders may vote their shares in person
by attending the special meeting or by proxy by completing the enclosed proxy
card, including signature and date, and mailing it to us in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope. 
IF A DYNAMIC SHAREHOLDER SIGNS AND RETURNS A WRITTEN
PROXY CARD

-19-



WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THE PROXY WILL BE
COUNTED AS A VOTE FOR THE MERGER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

     For Dynamic shareholders whose shares are held in street name (
i.e.
, in
the name of a broker, bank or other record holder), not returning a proxy card
or directing the record holder of their shares as to how to vote their shares
will have the same effect as voting those shares 
against 
the merger.

Revoking Proxies. 
Dynamic shareholders of record may revoke their proxies
at any time before their proxies are voted at the special meeting. Proxies may
be revoked by (1) submitting a written revocation to the Corporate Secretary of
Dynamic, (2) duly executing another valid proxy bearing a later date or (3)
attending the Dynamic special meeting and voting in person. A shareholders
attendance at the Dynamic special meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy,
the shareholder must obtain a ballot and vote at the special meeting. For any
notice of revocation or later proxy to be valid, however, it must actually be
received by Dynamic prior to the vote of the shareholders. Dynamic
shareholders of record should address any change or revocation to:

Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc.

615 Crescent Executive Court

Fifth Floor

Lake Mary, Florida 32746

Attention: Brian Greco, Secretary

General Information. 
Dynamic is not aware of any matters expected to be
presented for consideration at the special meeting other than the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If any other matters are
properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote the proxies in their
discretion in accordance with their best judgment with respect to such matters,
unless authorization to use that discretion is withheld. However, no proxy
having instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby may be voted in favor of a motion to
adjourn or postpone the meeting to another time or place.

Solicitation of Proxies

     In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of Dynamic, who will receive no compensation for their services other than
their regular salaries, may also solicit proxies from shareholders by
telephone, telecopy, telegram, in person, or other form of communication.
Dynamic has retained Morrow & Co., a proxy solicitation firm, to assist it in
the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting of Dynamic shareholders at
a fee of $7,500 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and, if
Dynamic requests Morrow & Co. to make calls to, or receive calls from,
nonobjecting beneficial owners, an additional $5.00 per such phone call.
Dynamic will request banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries to forward copies of these proxy materials to those persons for
whom they hold shares, and to secure their voting instructions, if necessary,
and will reimburse them for the expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to
such beneficial owners. Dynamic will bear all costs of the solicitation of
proxies from Dynamic shareholders.

     SHAREHOLDERS WHO SUBMIT PROXY CARDS SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK
CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR PROXY CARDS. A letter of transmittal with instructions
for the surrender of certificates representing Dynamic common shares will be
mailed by Cerners transfer agent to former Dynamic shareholders shortly after
the merger is completed.

THE MERGER

The following description of the material information pertaining to the
merger, including the summary of the material terms and provisions of the
merger agreement and the related stock option agreement. The descriptions of
the merger agreement and the related stock option agreement, which are
incorporated herein by reference, are qualified in their entirety by reference
to the merger agreement included in Appendix A and the stock option agreement
included in Appendix D. We urge you to read the Appendices in their entirety.

General

     Dynamic is furnishing this document to its common shareholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by its board of directors for use
at its special meeting of its shareholders.

     At the Dynamic shareholders meeting, holders of Dynamic common stock will
be asked to vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. The number of shares needed to approve this
proposal is at least a majority of the Dynamic common shares outstanding on
     . In addition, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby must be approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Dynamic preferred stock. Pursuant to a shareholders agreement, holders of
approximately 93% of the outstanding shares of Dynamic preferred stock have
agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. The merger will not be completed unless the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are approved and
adopted by the Dynamic shareholders.

     The Cerner board of directors and the Dynamic board of directors each have
approved the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of Dynamic with
and into Cerner Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cerner. Cerner
Holdings, Inc. will be the surviving corporation in the merger, and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the combined company. Upon consummation of the
merger, the shareholders of Dynamic will become shareholders of Cerner and the
separate corporate existence of Dynamic will terminate. Each outstanding share
of Cerner common stock will remain outstanding and unchanged as a result of the
merger. The name of the surviving company will be            , Inc., which
will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cerner.

Exchange of Dynamic Shares

     If you are a record holder of Dynamic common shares immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger and the merger proposal is approved you will
receive in exchange for each Dynamic common share approximately 0.0550 shares
of Cerner based on certain assumptions described below and subject to certain
adjustments. The exchange ratio that determines how many shares of Cerner
common stock you will receive is determined by dividing 362,791 by the number
of Dynamic common shares outstanding at the time all conditions to the merger
have been waived or satisfied. As of October 16, 2001, there were 6,593,216
Dynamic common shares outstanding. Therefore, the basic exchange ratio (the
ratio that would be applied if no adjustment is necessary as described further
below) is 0.0550 (362,791 divided by 6,593,216). However, if the average
trading price per share of Cerner common stock for the 15 trading day period
ending on the day immediately prior to the date that all conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived is greater than $64.50, then the basic exchange
ratio will be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is 64.50 and the
denominator of which is the average Cerner stock price during such 15 day
period. For example, if the average Cerner stock price as determined above is
$68.00 then the exchange ratio would be 0.0522 (0.0550 (the basic exchange
ratio) multiplied by 0.9485 (64.50 divided by 68.00)). The closing price of
Cerner common stock on            , 2001 was $           .

     No fractional shares of Cerner common stock will be issued to any holder
of Dynamic common shares upon completion of the merger. For each fractional
share that would otherwise be issued, Cerner will pay in cash an amount equal
to the fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sale prices of Cerner
common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the 15 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the first trading day prior to the date all
conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived. No interest will be paid
or accrued on cash payable to holders in lieu of fractional shares.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the closing of the merger each
Dynamic preferred share will be redeemed at a price of $2.00 in cash, plus all
unpaid and accrued dividends through the date of the merger.

Dynamic common shares and the holders of Cerner common stock, see Comparative
Rights of Shareholders on page      .

Dynamic Stock Options and Warrants

     Each outstanding option or warrant to acquire Dynamic common shares will
be automatically converted at the effective time of the merger into options and
warrants to purchase Cerner common stock. To the extent that any such options
were issued under any Dynamic stock option or incentive plan, such options will
continue to be governed by the terms of the Dynamic stock plan and related
grant agreements under which they were granted, and the warrants will continue
to be governed by any agreement pursuant to which they were issued, except in
each case that:



the number of shares of Cerner common stock subject to the
new Cerner stock option or warrant will be equal to the product of
the number of Dynamic common shares subject to the Dynamic stock
option or warrant agreement and the exchange ratio as described
above under Exchange of Dynamic Shares, rounded to the nearest
whole share, and



the exercise price per share of Cerner common stock subject
to the new Cerner stock option or warrant will be equal to the
exercise price per Dynamic common share under the Dynamic stock
option or warrant agreement divided by the exchange ratio as
described above under Exchange of Dynamic Shares, rounded to the
nearest one-hundredth of a cent.

     In any event, stock options that are incentive stock options under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be adjusted in the manner
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.

     Additionally, stock options and warrants issued to and held by directors
of Dynamic, as well as certain stock options held by officers and employees of
Dynamic, will be fully vested upon consummation of the merger. The options,
however, cannot be exercised until 12 months after the original date of grant.
Accordingly, such warrants and options that have been outstanding for at least
12 months will be immediately exercisable for shares of Cerner common stock
following the closing of the merger.

Exchange of Stock Certificates

     At or prior to the completion of the merger, Cerner will deposit with UMB
Bank, n.a. certificates representing the shares of Cerner common stock to be
issued in connection with the merger and the cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional shares to be issued in the merger. UMB Bank, n.a. will act as the
exchange agent for the benefit of the holders of certificates of Dynamic common
shares.

     Promptly after the completion of the merger, a form of transmittal letter
will be mailed by UMB Bank, n.a. to each former Dynamic common shareholder.
This transmittal letter will contain instructions for the surrender of
certificates representing Dynamic common shares in exchange for shares of
Cerner common stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.

You should not return your Dynamic common share certificates with the
enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward them to the exchange agent
until you receive a letter of transmittal after completion of the merger.

     Until you surrender your Dynamic common share certificates for exchange
after completion of the merger, you will accrue but will not be paid any
dividends or other distributions declared after the effective time of the
merger with respect to Cerner common stock into which your shares have been
converted. When you surrender your certificates, Cerner will pay any unpaid
dividends or other distributions, without interest. After the effective time
of the merger, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Dynamic of any Dynamic common shares. If certificates representing Dynamic
common shares are presented for transfer after the completion of the merger,
they will be cancelled and exchanged for a certificate representing the
applicable number of shares of Cerner common stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares.

     If a certificate of Dynamic common shares has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the consideration properly payable
under the merger agreement upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to that
loss, theft or destruction, appropriate evidence as to the ownership of that
certificate by the claimant, and appropriate and customary indemnification
and/or a bond.

Background of the Merger

     Over the past few years, Dynamic has monitored and analyzed the
competition in its industry, and the advantages associated with the growth of
Dynamic as a means to effectively compete for market share. In early 2000,
Dynamic determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its
shareholders to consider undertaking a significant and strategic transaction as
a means of growing Dynamic, both in absolute size and in stature, and
maximizing shareholder value. Three possible strategic alternatives were
considered; namely, (1) to seek a significant and accretive acquisition
candidate, (2) enter into a strategic cross marketing/distribution arrangement
or (3) consider the sale of the business to a leading health information
system provider or company in a related industry.

     Dynamic actively investigated each of these strategies during the first
half of 2000 and met with several potential business partners or acquisition
candidates, but no formal negotiations for any specific transaction was
commenced and Dynamic was unable to reach any agreements. In July 2000,
Dynamic was approached by ADAC Laboratories, Inc. through its investment
banker, Bear Stearns & Co. and was offered an opportunity to acquire the assets
and business of ADACs Healthcare Information Systems division in exchange for
common shares of Dynamic. Negotiations and due diligence examinations took
place from August 2000 through early October 2000. Following due diligence,
the parties decided not to proceed with the proposed transaction.

     Following this decision, after a review of several merger and
recapitalization opportunities, the board of directors determined that Dynamic
should engage the services of an investment banking firm to evaluate the
strategic alternatives available to it. Management and several board members
interviewed or met with six potential investment banking firms and SG Cowen
Securities Corporation was selected based on the strength of its investment
banking presence in the healthcare information and e-health area. On October
6, 2000, Dynamic engaged SG Cowen to act as its financial advisor in connection with Dynamics
general financial strategy and planning. On October 24, 2000, ADAC
announced that it had agreed to sell the Healthcare Information Systems
division to Cerner in an all cash transaction. On November 17, 2000, SG Cowen
and Dynamic revised their relationship in a new agreement pursuant to which SG
Cowen was to act as a financial advisor in connection with the possible sale
of Dynamic or a suitable joint venture arrangement. SG Cowen subsequently
contacted a number of companies that it believed might have an interest in such
a transaction with Dynamic. Cerner was one of those companies contacted. In
December 2000 and January 2001, after receipt of executed confidentiality
agreements, SG Cowen distributed preliminary information about Dynamic to 12
companies expressing an interest in Dynamic. At that time, Cerner did not
express any interest nor did it request any such information. On February 23,
2001, the Dynamic board of directors met to review the status of SG Cowens
inquiries and solicitation of interest. SG Cowen identified each of the
companies that had been contacted and those that had requested information
about Dynamic, and advised the board that of the companies receiving such
information, seven were still at various stages in their review and in some
cases had requested and had been furnished with additional information.

     Although Cerner had not originally expressed an interest in pursuing a
transaction with Dynamic, in May 2001 representatives of Cerner approached
Dynamic to express such an interest. A confidentiality agreement between
Dynamic and Cerner was executed on May 25, 2001 and during June 2001, Cerner
and Dynamic exchanged pertinent financial and other information. On June 27,
2001, Cerner submitted a preliminary proposal to acquire Dynamic in a stock for
stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio which, on the date of the proposal,
was equal to $0.50 per Dynamic common share (or $1.50 on a post-split basis),
or an aggregate of approximately $12 million (including the redemption of the
preferred shares at $2.00 per share). The proposal was conditioned upon, among
other things, the due diligence review of Cerner. On July 2, 2001, the Dynamic
board of directors, together with representatives of Carlton Fields, P.A., the
companys legal counsel, met by telephone conference to review the Cerner
proposal. Representatives of Carlton Fields discussed with the board of
directors the nature and scope of their fiduciary duties in considering the
Cerner proposal. During the meeting, SG Cowen reviewed with the board some of
the financial aspects of Cerners proposal, including a comparison of the
proposed offering price with the historical prices for Dynamic common shares
during the past 12 months, a review of premiums paid for other companies, and a
review of financial aspects of other selected acquisitions in the healthcare
information systems industry. SG Cowen also reviewed the prices of Cerners
common stock since January 1, 2000, and provided a comparison of certain Cerner
financial results to those of its competitors. After careful review of the
Cerner offer and the information provided by SG Cowen, the board of directors
of Dynamic rejected the proposal as being inadequate.

     The board of directors of Dynamic then formed a negotiating committee
consisting of Jerry L. Carson, T. Christopher Assif and Daniel Raynor which was
directed to meet with representatives of Cerner to explain the rationale for
Dynamics position, determine whether any additional negotiation with Cerner
would be useful, and determine whether any of the other companies that had
requested information about Dynamic might be interested in commencing the
negotiation of a transaction with Dynamic. Any potential transaction with
Cerner or any other company was to be considered against

-23-



the prospects of
Dynamic continuing as an independent entity and the future shareholder value
that would result from such a strategy. During this period of time, a member
of the negotiating committee contacted several of the companies which had
previously requested information about Dynamic to ascertain whether there might
be an interest in pursuing a transaction with Dynamic. Following these
contacts, Dynamic held informal discussions with several of these companies.

     On July 10, 2001, Mr. Assif met with representatives of Cerner to
determine Cerners interest in continuing to pursue a potential transaction.
On July 25, 2001, Cerner presented a revised proposal to purchase Dynamic at a
purchase price on the date of the proposal equal to $2.92 per share (on a
post-split basis) payable in Cerner common stock, or an aggregate value of
approximately $20 million (including the redemption of the preferred shares at
$2.00 per share), at a fixed exchange ratio which provided for adjustment upon
certain changes in the price of Cerner common stock prior to the merger. The
second proposal included the general terms of a transaction and the negotiating
committee met with representatives of Cerner to discuss the proposal in greater
detail. Further discussions between the parties were held during the next few
days. During these negotiations, Cerner requested, as consideration for
proceeding further, that Dynamic agree to discontinue any solicitation of other
transactions for a limited period of time. On August 13, 2001, Dynamic entered
into an agreement to this effect. This agreement also provided for a $500,000
break-up fee to be paid by Dynamic to Cerner if Dynamic executed an acquisition
agreement with a third party before September 30, 2001.

     Between August 14, 2001 and September 4, 2001 representatives of Cerner
and Dynamic undertook extensive bilateral due diligence and with the assistance
of Stinson, Mag & Fizzell, P.C. and Carlton Fields, P.A., their respective
legal counsels, they negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related
documents. On August 17, 2001, SG Cowens engagement as Dynamics financial
advisor expired. Accordingly, on August 29, 2001, Dynamic entered into a new
agreement engaging SG Cowen to render an opinion as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the proposed exchange ratio of the Cerner offer.
The Dynamic board of directors held a special meeting on September 5, 2001, to
review and consider Cerners offer and the material terms of the proposed
definitive merger agreement. At this meeting, representatives of Carlton
Fields reviewed in detail for the Dynamic board of directors the terms of the
proposed merger agreement and other legal aspects of the Cerner transaction.
SG Cowen then made a presentation to the board regarding its financial analyses with respect to
the proposed exchange ratio. SG Cowens analyses are summarized in this proxy
statement/prospectus under  Opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation. SG
Cowen also delivered to the board of directors its opinion that, as of that
date, the exchange ratio offered by Cerner was fair to the Dynamic common
shareholders from a financial point of view. The board of directors asked
numerous questions concerning the analysis and to ascertain whether the
proposed purchase price adequately reflected the value of Dynamic and its
perceived growth potential (and the risks associated therewith), and how the
current offer compared with other recent transactions. The board of directors
also thoroughly reviewed and considered the conditions of the offer, the form
of consideration offered (Cerner common stock), the structure of the offer,
including price protections, and the possibility of obtaining a higher offer in
the future. After further discussion, the board of directors voted to approve
the merger agreement and later on September 5, 2001, the parties executed the
merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Dynamic Board and Reasons for the Merger

     Dynamics board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable
and fair to and in the best interests of Dynamic and its shareholders and has
approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger. 
Accordingly, the Dynamic board recommends that
shareholders vote FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger
.

     In reaching its determination that the merger is fair to and in the best
interests of Dynamic and its shareholders, the Dynamic board consulted with its
management, its financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of
factors, which included (but did not consist exclusively of) the following:



The financial terms of the merger, including the value of the
merger consideration offered, the premium to be paid as it relates
to both the book value of Dynamic and the recent historical market
prices for the Dynamic common shares, the prices paid in comparable
transactions, the relative earnings per share and the relative
shareholders equity of Cerner and Dynamic. The Dynamic board also
considered Dynamics ability to continue to meet Nasdaq NMS listing
requirements, the greater liquidity and more active trading market
for the Cerner common stock, and the ability to terminate the
transaction if the market price of the Cerner common stock falls
below a floor price for a prolonged period prior to closing the
merger.



Dynamics limited capital resources, as evidenced by its
negative working capital, and the difficulty of raising additional
capital on satisfactory terms under current market conditions.

-24-





The future prospects of Dynamic and possible alternatives
available to the proposed merger, including the prospects of
continuing as an independent stand alone company. The Dynamic board
considered its prior and recent experiences in attempting to
identify a strategic partner or a potential business combination,
the timing of the offer, the prospects for receiving a better
financial offer from another acquiror, and the risks associated with
all such alternatives, including those which could affect the
ability of Dynamic to achieve its projected results of operations if
it should remain independent. With respect to the prospect of
remaining independent, based on its analysis the Dynamic board
concluded that the values to be received upon the sale of Dynamic to
Cerner would be higher in the long term and less susceptible to the
risks of remaining independent.



The opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation to the Dynamic
board of directors that, as of the date of the opinion, the exchange
ratio established under the terms of the merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to the Dynamic common shareholders.
The opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation is set forth in
Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus.



Information with respect to the financial condition, results
of operations, business, and prospects of Dynamic and the current
industry, economic, and market conditions, as well as the risks
associated with achieving these prospects.



The business and financial condition and earning prospects of
Cerner, the potential growth of Cerners business operations, and
the competence, integrity, and experience of Cerner and its
management. In this regard, the Dynamic board considered the long
term prospects for appreciation in the Cerner common stock.



The non-financial terms and structure of the proposed merger,
and in particular, the fact that the merger is intended to qualify
as a tax free exchange to Dynamic common shareholders. In addition,
the Dynamic board considered the fiduciary out and termination
provisions of the merger agreement which would not prevent the
Dynamic board from accepting a superior acquisition proposal,
subject to paying Cerner a termination fee.



The size of the termination fee and the conditions under
which it is payable, and the determination that such provisions are
reasonable in light of the benefits of the merger and the process
that was conducted.



The social and economic effect on Dynamic and its employees,
customers, suppliers, and other constituencies of the communities in
which Dynamic is located. In this regard, the Dynamic board
considered the terms of the employee benefits to be received, the
complementary nature of the products offered by Cerner, the access
that the Dynamic products will have to additional distribution
channels, and the increased level of services that can be provided
to existing customers of Dynamic.

     The Dynamic board also considered:



The risks that the benefits sought in the transaction would not be obtained.



The risk that the transaction would not be consummated.



The risk that the value of the Cerner common stock will decline.



The effect of a public announcement of the merger on
Dynamics sales, customer and supplier relationships, operating
results and the ability to retain employees, and on the trading
price of the Dynamic common shares.



The substantial time and effort of management that will be
required to consummate the merger and integrate the operations of
the two companies.



The impact of the transaction on Dynamic employees.



The possibility that the provisions of the merger agreement
and the stock option agreement might have the effect of discouraging
other persons potentially interested in a business combination with
Dynamic from pursuing such an opportunity.

-25-



     The board also recognized that members of Dynamics board and executive
officers have interests in the merger that are different from Dynamics other
shareholders. See  Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.

     In the judgment of the Dynamic board, the potential benefits of the
transaction outweigh the potential negative elements of the above-described
considerations.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors discussed by the
Dynamic board is not meant to be exhaustive but includes all material factors
considered by the board. In view of the complexity and wide variety of
information and factors considered, both positive and negative, the Dynamic
board did not find it practical to quantify, rank or otherwise attach any
relative weight to the various factors. In addition, the Dynamic board did not
reach any specific conclusion with respect to each of the factors considered,
or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of
these factors, including thorough discussions with Dynamics management and legal and
financial advisors. However, the Dynamic board did place a special emphasis on
the consideration payable in connection with the proposed merger and the
receipt of a fairness opinion from SG Cowen Securities Corporation as set forth
in Appendix B of this proxy statement/prospectus. See  Opinion of SG Cowen
Securities Corporation below. As a result of its consideration of the
foregoing, the Dynamic board determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are fair to and in the
best interests of Dynamic and its shareholders and approved and adopted, the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger.

Cerners Reasons for the Merger

     Cerners board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Cerner and its shareholders and has
approved and adopted the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. In reaching the determination that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Cerner and its shareholders, the Cerner
board considered a number of factors, which included (but did not consist
exclusively of) the following:

      The acquisition of Dynamic is complementary to Cerners existing
pathology, laboratory and radiology client bases that primarily consists
of larger hospitals, health systems and independent laboratories and will
allow Cerner to broaden its market presence in the healthcare industry,
furthering Cerners mission to improve healthcare efficiencies, patient
safety and appropriate clinical decision-making.

      Dynamic clients will be provided an opportunity to expand their
automation of clinical processes throughout the entire healthcare
organization through Cerners HNA Millennium suite of products and
through Cerners application and data services business. This
represents additional market opportunities for Cerner.

      Cerner should be able to reduce operating costs of the Dynamic
business by reducing Dynamics cost structure, for example eliminating
Dynamics cost of being a stand-alone public company (e.g., costs of
complying with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, auditing costs and duplicative administrative
resources).

      Cerners existing knowledge of the pathology, laboratory and
radiology businesses should allow Cerner to absorb Dynamic in an
efficient manner.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors discussed by the
Cerner board is not meant to be exhaustive but includes all material factors
considered by the Cerner board. The Cerner board did not find it practical to
quantify, rank or otherwise attach any relative weight to the various factors.
In addition, the Cerner board did not reach any specific conclusion with
respect to each of the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular
factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors, including
discussions with Cerners management and legal and financial advisors. As a
result of its consideration of the foregoing, the Cerner board determined that
the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Cerner and its shareholders
and approved and adopted the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.

Opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 29, 2001, Dynamic retained
SG Cowen Securities Corporation to render an opinion to the board of directors
of Dynamic as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Dynamic common shares of the exchange ratio pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement.

-26-



     On September 5, 2001, SG Cowen delivered certain of its written analyses
and its oral opinion to the Dynamic board, subsequently confirmed in writing as
of the same date, to the effect that, and subject to the various assumptions
set forth therein, as of September 5, 2001, the exchange ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of common stock of Dynamic. 
The full
text of the written opinion of SG Cowen, dated September 5, 2001, is attached
as Appendix B and is incorporated by reference. Holders of Dynamic common
stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety for the assumptions made,
procedures followed, other matters considered and limits of the review by SG
Cowen. The summary of the written opinion of SG Cowen set forth herein is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. SG
Cowens analyses and opinion were prepared for and addressed to the Dynamic
board and are directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the exchange ratio to the holders of Dynamic common shares, and do not
constitute an opinion as to the merits of the merger or a recommendation to any
shareholders as to how to vote on the proposed merger. The exchange ratio was
determined through negotiations between Dynamic and Cerner and not pursuant to
recommendations of SG Cowen.

     In arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen reviewed and considered such
financial and other matters as it deemed relevant, including, among other
things:



a draft of the merger agreement dated August 31, 2001;



certain publicly available information for Dynamic and
certain other relevant financial and operating data furnished to SG
Cowen by Dynamic management;



certain publicly available information for Cerner;



certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts,
reports and other information concerning Dynamic prepared by its
management;



the amounts and timing of the cost savings and related
expenses expected to result from the merger furnished to SG Cowen by
the management of Dynamic;



First Call estimates and financial projections in Wall Street
analyst reports for Cerner;



discussions with certain members of the management of both
Dynamic and Cerner concerning the historical and current business
operations, financial conditions and prospects of Dynamic and Cerner
and such other matters SG Cowen deemed relevant;



certain operating results, the reported price and trading
histories of the shares of the common stock of Cerner and the common
shares of Dynamic as compared to the operating results, the reported
price and trading histories of selected publicly traded companies SG
Cowen deemed relevant;



certain financial terms of the merger as compared to the
financial terms of selected business combinations SG Cowen deemed
relevant;



based on the financial forecasts furnished to SG Cowen by
Dynamic management, the cash flows generated by Dynamic on a
stand-alone basis to determine the present value of the discounted
cash flows;



certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on an
accretion/dilution basis; and



such other information, financial studies, analyses and
investigations and such other factors that SG Cowen deemed relevant
for the purposes of this opinion.

     In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen, with
Dynamics consent, assumed and relied, without independent investigation, upon
the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information provided
to it by Dynamic and Cerner, respectively, or which was publicly available. SG
Cowen did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
reasonableness of, or independently to verify, this information. In addition,
SG Cowen did not conduct any physical inspection of the properties or
facilities of Dynamic or Cerner. SG Cowen further relied upon the assurance of
management of Dynamic that they were unaware of any facts that would make the
information provided to

-27-



SG Cowen incomplete or misleading in any respect. SG
Cowen, with Dynamics consent, assumed that the financial forecasts and
synergies provided to SG Cowen were reasonably prepared by the management of
Dynamic, and reflected the best available estimates and good faith judgments of
such management as to the future performance of Dynamic and the expected
synergies. Management of Dynamic confirmed to SG Cowen, and SG Cowen assumed,
with Dynamics consent, that the financial forecasts and the expected synergies
provided by Dynamic management, and the First Call estimates and the analyst
projections with respect to Cerner provided a reasonable basis for SG Cowens
opinion.

     SG Cowen did not make or obtain any independent evaluations, valuations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Dynamic or Cerner, nor was SG Cowen
furnished with these materials. With respect to all legal matters relating to
Dynamic and Cerner, SG Cowen relied on the advice of legal counsel to Dynamic.
SG Cowen expresses no opinion with respect to any legal matter. SG Cowens
services to Dynamic in connection with the merger were comprised solely of
rendering an opinion from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio. SG
Cowens opinion was necessarily based upon economic and market conditions and
other circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by SG Cowen on the
date of its opinion. It should be understood that although subsequent
developments may affect its opinion, SG Cowen does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion and SG Cowen expressly disclaims any
responsibility to do so.

     In rendering its opinion, SG Cowen assumed, in all respects material to
its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained
in the merger agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all
of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger
agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be
satisfied without waiver thereof. SG Cowen assumed that the final form of the
merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last draft received by
SG Cowen prior to rendering its opinion. SG Cowen also assumed that all
governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals contemplated by the
merger agreement would be obtained and that, in the course of obtaining any of
those consents, no restrictions will be imposed or waivers made that would have
an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger. SG Cowen also
assumed that, immediately prior to or concurrent with the merger, all
outstanding shares of preferred stock of Dynamic will be redeemed for an
aggregate consideration of $2.0 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends. SG
Cowen expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the terms of the redemption.
Dynamic informed SG Cowen, and SG Cowen assumed, that the merger will be
treated as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     SG Cowens opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
as to how such shareholder should vote on the proposed merger. SG Cowens
opinion does not imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range for
Dynamics or Cerners common stock following consummation of the merger or
otherwise, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally
influence the price of securities. SG Cowens opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Dynamics common
shares of the exchange ratio. SG Cowen expresses no opinion as to the
underlying business reasons that may support the decision of Dynamics board to
approve, or Dynamics decision to consummate, the merger.

     The following is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed
by SG Cowen to arrive at its opinion. Some of the summaries of financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the
tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses. SG Cowen performed certain
procedures, including each of the financial analyses described below, and
reviewed with the management of Dynamic and Cerner the assumptions on which
such analyses were based and other factors, and reviewed with the management of
Dynamic the historical and projected financial results of Dynamic.

Analysis of Premiums Paid in Selected Transactions. 
SG Cowen reviewed the
premium of the offer price over the trading prices one trading day and four

Analysis of Selected Transactions. 
SG Cowen also reviewed the financial
terms, to the extent publicly available, of the selected healthcare information
technology transactions. SG Cowen reviewed the enterprise value (defined as
the market capitalization of common stock plus total debt less cash and
equivalents) paid in the selected transactions as a multiple of latest reported
12 month (referred to as LTM) revenues, earnings before interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization (referred to as EBITDA) and
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (referred to as EBIT), and
also examined the multiples of equity value paid in the selected transactions
to book value and LTM earnings.

     The following tables present, for the periods indicated, the low, mean,
median and high multiples implied by the ratio of enterprise value to LTM
revenues, EBIT and EBITDA, and the ratio of equity value to book value and LTM
earnings for the selected transactions and the corresponding multiples for
Dynamic implied by the exchange ratio. The information in the tables is based
on the closing price of Dynamics common shares and Cerners common stock on
September 4, 2001.

Although the selected transactions were used for comparison purposes, none
of those transactions is directly comparable to the merger, and none of the
companies in those transactions is directly comparable to Dynamic or Cerner.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of such a comparison is not purely
mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the acquisition value of such companies or Dynamic to which they are being
compared.

Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies. 
To provide contextual
data and comparative market information, SG Cowen compared selected historical
operating and financial data and ratios for Dynamic to the corresponding
financial data and ratios of six other companies in the healthcare information
technology industry whose securities are publicly traded and which SG Cowen
believes have operating, market valuation and trading valuations similar to
what might be expected of Dynamic. These companies were:



First Consulting Group, Inc.



Mediware Information Systems, Inc.



QuadraMed, Inc.



Quality Systems, Inc.



Superior Consultant Holdings Corp.



VitalWorks, Inc.

     The data and ratios included the enterprise value of the selected
companies as multiples of LTM revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, of estimated 2001
calendar year revenues, EBITDA and EBIT and of estimated 2002 calendar year
revenues, EBITDA and EBIT. SG Cowen also examined the ratios of the current
share prices of the selected companies to

-30-



the LTM earnings per share (referred
to as EPS), estimated 2001 calendar year EPS and estimated 2002 calendar year
EPS (in each case, as available from research analyst reports or, if not so
available, First Call).

     The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the low, mean,
median and high multiples implied for the selected companies by the ratio of
enterprise value to LTM revenues, LTM EBITDA, and estimated 2001 and 2002
calendar year revenues, and the ratio of equity value to 2002 calendar year
earnings. SG Cowen noted that the LTM and estimated 2001 and 2002 EBIT and
EBITDA and LTM and estimated 2001 earnings for all but one of the selected
companies were either negative or not available, and did not derive low, mean,
median or high multiples with respect to these ratios. The information in the
table is based on the closing price of Dynamics common shares and Cerners
common stock on September 4, 2001.

those companies is directly comparable to Dynamic. Accordingly, an analysis of
the results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead

Stock Trading History.

To provide contextual data and comparative market
data, SG Cowen reviewed the historical market prices of Dynamics common shares
from September 5, 2000 to September 4, 2001. SG Cowen noted that over the
twelve-month period indicated, the high and low prices for shares of Dynamic
were $3.94 and $1.17, respectively. The closing price on September 4, 2001 was
$2.08.

     SG Cowen also reviewed the historical market prices of Cerners common

SG Cowen analyzed the respective contributions of
LTM and estimated fiscal years 2001 and 2002 revenues, EBITDA, EBIT and net
income to the combined company, based upon the historical financial

-31-



results of
Dynamic and Cerner the financial forecasts prepared by the management of
Dynamic and analyst projections for Cerner. The following table shows

Pro Forma Ownership Analysis. 
SG Cowen analyzed the pro forma ownership
in the combined company by the holders of Dynamic and noted that holders of
Dynamic common shares would own approximately 0.9% of the combined company,
based on the Dynamic closing share price on September 4, 2001.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. 
SG Cowen estimated a range of values for
Dynamic common shares based upon the discounted present value of the projected
after-tax cash flows of Dynamic described in the financial forecasts provided
by management of Dynamic for the four and one-quarter fiscal years from August
31, 2001, through December 31, 2005, and of the terminal value of Dynamic at
December 31, 2005, based upon multiples of revenue. After-tax cash flow was
calculated by taking projected EBIT and subtracting from this amount projected
taxes, capital expenditures, changes in working capital and changes in other
assets and liabilities and adding back projected depreciation and amortization.
This analysis was based upon certain assumptions described by, projections
supplied by and discussions held with the management of Dynamic. In performing
this analysis, SG Cowen utilized discount rates ranging from 15.0% to 20.0%.
SG Cowen utilized terminal multiples of revenue ranging from 0.50 times to 0.80
times, these multiples representing the general range of multiples of revenues
for the selected healthcare information technology companies and the selected healthcare
information technology transactions.

     Utilizing this methodology, the per share equity value of Dynamic ranged
from $2.35 through $3.49 per share based upon the Dynamic financial forecasts.

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of all the analyses performed by SG Cowen. The preparation of a fairness
opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. SG Cowen did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each
analysis and factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors
summarized above, SG Cowen believes, and has advised the Dynamic board, that
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
In performing its analyses, SG Cowen made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of Dynamic and Cerner. These analyses
performed by SG Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may

-32-



be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events
beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors. None of
Dynamic, Cerner, SG Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those projected. The analyses supplied
by SG Cowen and its opinion were among several factors taken into consideration
by the Dynamic board in making its decision to enter into the merger agreement
and should not be considered as determinative of such decision.

     SG Cowen was selected by the Dynamic board to render an opinion to the
Dynamic board because SG Cowen is a nationally recognized investment banking
firm and because, as part of its investment banking business, SG Cowen is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. SG Cowen is providing financial
services for Dynamic for which it will receive customary fees. In addition, in
the ordinary course of its business, SG Cowen and its affiliates may trade the
equity securities of Dynamic and Cerner for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to the SG Cowen engagement letter, SG Cowen is entitled to
receive a fee of $500,000 for rendering its opinion. Additionally, SG Cowen
will also receive a fee of $250,000 contingent upon the consummation of the
merger in consideration of certain financial advisory services provided to
Dynamic by SG Cowen unrelated to the merger. See  Background of the Merger.
Additionally, Dynamic has agreed to reimburse SG Cowen for its out-of-pocket
expenses, including attorneys fees, and has agreed to indemnify SG Cowen
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with SG Cowen, which are customary in
transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arms length between Dynamic
and SG Cowen, and the Dynamic board was aware of the arrangement, including the
fact that a portion of the fee payable to SG Cowen is contingent upon the
completion of the merger.

Federal Securities Laws Consequences and Restrictions on Resales by Affiliates

     Shares of Cerner common stock to be issued to Dynamic shareholders in the
merger have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
may be traded freely and without restriction by those shareholders not deemed
to be affiliates (as that term is defined under the Securities Act) of Dynamic.
Any subsequent transfer of shares, however, by any person who is an affiliate
of Dynamic at the time the merger is submitted for a vote of the Dynamic
shareholders will, under existing law, require either:



the further registration under the Securities Act of the
Cerner common stock to be transferred,



compliance with Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act, which permits limited sales under certain circumstances, or



the availability of another exemption from registration.

     An affiliate of Dynamic is a person who directly, or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with, Dynamic. These restrictions are expected to apply to the
directors and executive officers of Dynamic and the holders of ten percent or
more of the outstanding Dynamic common shares. The same restrictions apply to
the spouses and certain relatives of those persons and any trusts, estates,
corporations or other entities in which those persons have a ten percent or
greater beneficial or equity interest. Cerner will give stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent with respect to the shares of Cerner common
stock to be received by persons subject to these restrictions, and the
certificates for their shares will be appropriately legended.

     Dynamic has agreed in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who is an affiliate of Dynamic, for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act, to deliver to Cerner a written agreement
intended to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

Shareholders Agreement

     Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, two holders
of Dynamic preferred shares entered into a shareholders agreement with Cerner.
The shareholders agreement requires such preferred shareholders to vote all

-33-



Dynamic preferred shares held by them in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. In addition, such
shareholders also granted to Cerner an irrevocable proxy to vote their
preferred shares in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. The shareholders that are subject to the
shareholders agreement hold a total of 930,000 Dynamic preferred shares, which
constitutes approximately 93% of the outstanding Dynamic preferred shares. In
order to complete the merger, a majority of the preferred shares, voting as a
separate class, must be voted in favor of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. This agreement to vote the Dynamic
preferred shares does not affect the vote by the holders of Dynamic common
shares. The complete text of the shareholder agreement is attached hereto as
Appendix C.

Stock Option Agreement

General. 
As a condition to entering into the merger agreement, Cerner
required that Dynamic enter into a stock option agreement, which allows Cerner,
under certain circumstances, to purchase up to 985,476 Dynamic common shares
(representing approximately 15% of Dynamics issued and outstanding common
shares), subject to adjustments so that in no event may Cerner acquire Dynamic
common shares representing more than 15% of the issued and outstanding Dynamic
common shares, at an exercise price of $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment).
The option may only be exercised upon the occurrence of certain events which
are described below.

     The stock option agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:
(a) the completion of the merger; or (b) the close of business on the earlier
of: (1) the date one year following a triggering event (as described below) or
(2) the date on which it is no longer possible for a triggering event to occur.

     In addition, the stock option agreement provides Cerner with certain
rights to require Dynamic to register the Dynamic common shares acquired by or
issuable upon the exercise of the stock option agreement under the Securities
Act of 1933 and provides Cerner the right, under certain circumstances, to
require Dynamic to repurchase the option following a triggering event.

Effect of Stock Option Agreement. 
Cerner and Dynamic entered into the
stock option agreement to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed in accordance with its terms. The stock option agreement may have
the effect of discouraging persons who might be interested in acquiring all of
or a significant interest in Dynamic, even if such person were prepared to pay
a higher price per Dynamic common share than the value per share contemplated
by the merger agreement. The acquisition by a third party of Dynamic or a
significant interest in Dynamic or a significant portion of its consolidated
assets, or an agreement to do so, could cause the option to be exercisable and
significantly increase the cost of the acquisition to a potential acquiror.
Such increased costs might discourage a potential acquiror from considering or
proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential acquiror proposing to
pay a lower per share price to acquire Dynamic than it might otherwise have
proposed to pay.

Terms of Stock Option Agreement. 
The following is a brief summary of
certain provisions of the stock option agreement, which is attached hereto as
Appendix D. The summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified by
reference to the complete text of the agreement.

     Cerner may exercise the option, in whole but not in part, at any time
during the one year period following the occurrence of a triggering event as
defined below. A triggering event means any of the following events:



Dynamics withdrawal, modification, or material qualification
in any manner adverse to Cerner of its recommendation that Dynamic
shareholders approve the merger, or taking any action or making any
statement in connection with the Dynamic shareholder meeting
materially inconsistent with such recommendation;



The solicitation, initiation or the knowing facilitation or
encouragement of a submission of any acquisition proposal (as
defined below) for Dynamic;



Dynamics participation in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnishing to any person any information with respect
to, or taking any other action knowingly to facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes an acquisition
proposal for Dynamic;

-34-





The approval, endorsement or recommendation of, or the
execution of or entering into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principal, or a definitive agreement by Dynamics Board of Directors
relating to any acquisition proposal;



Dynamics failure to recommend that its security holders
reject any tender or exchange offer relating to securities of
Dynamic;



Dynamics grant of a waiver or a release under any standstill
or any similar agreement with respect to any class of Dynamic equity
securities; or



Dynamic entering into any agreement with respect to any
acquisition proposal for Dynamic.

An Acquisition Proposal. 
For these purposes acquisition proposal means
any offer or proposal for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, issuance of securities,
liquidation, dissolution, tender offer or exchange offer or other similar
transaction or series of transactions involving, or any purchase of 10% or more
of the assets, or directly or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership of
securities representing or exchangeable for or convertible into, more than 10%
of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Dynamic or
in which Dynamic issues securities representing 10% of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of Dynamic, other than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Fees and Expenses of the Merger

     Each party is responsible for its own expenses in connection with the
merger.

Accounting Treatment

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase, as such term is used
under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Dynamic will be treated as
the acquired corporation for such purposes. Dynamics assets, liabilities and
other items will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on the closing date
of the merger and will be recorded in Cerners consolidated financial
statements. The difference between the estimated fair value of the assets,
liabilities and other items (adjusted as discussed above) and the purchase
price, if any, will be recorded as goodwill. In accordance with the recently
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
Combinations, goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject to periodic
tests for impairment. Cerners consolidated financial statements will include the
operations of the surviving company after the effective time of the merger.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

     The following is a discussion of the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code (the Code), Treasury regulations, rulings of the Internal Revenue
Service (the IRS) and court decisions as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Those authorities may change, possibly retroactively,
which could alter the tax consequences described below.

This discussion assumes that the Dynamic common and preferred shares are
held as a capital asset. In addition, this discussion does not address all of
the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
circumstances or to Dynamic shareholders subject to special rules, such as
foreign persons, financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in
securities or foreign currencies, insurance companies or mutual funds. In
addition, this discussion does not discuss the consequences to shareholders who
are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions, acquired their shares in
stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions,
hold their shares as part of a hedging, straddle, conversion or other risk
reduction transaction or hold the Dynamic stock as qualified small business
stock.

     It is a condition to the obligation of Cerner and Dynamic to complete the
merger that the parties receive the opinion of Cerners counsel, dated as of
the completion of the merger, that the merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code. The opinions
will be based upon the facts existing at the completion of the merger. In
rendering its opinion, Cerners counsel will require and rely upon
representations contained in certificates of

-35-



officers of Dynamic, Cerner and
others. The tax opinion will not bind the IRS nor stop the IRS from taking a
contrary position.

     In the opinion of Stinson, Mag & Fizzell, P.C., assuming that the merger
is consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and as
described in this prospectus/proxy statement and that the representations
described in the preceding paragraph are true and complete as of the effective
time of the merger, the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Based on the merger being treated as a
reorganization for federal income tax purposes, the merger will have the
following U.S. federal income tax consequences:



An exchanging Dynamic common shareholder will not recognize gain or
loss (not including any gain or loss attributable to fractional
shares) on the exchange of his or her Dynamic common shares in the
merger for shares of Cerner common stock.



The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Cerner common stock received
by Dynamic shareholders will equal the aggregate tax basis of the
Dynamic common shares surrendered in exchange for such Cerner common
stock (not including any basis attributable to fractional shares).



The holding period of a share of Cerner common stock received in the
merger will include the holders holding period in the Dynamic common
shares surrendered in the exchange for the Cerner common stock.



A Dynamic common shareholder receiving cash for a fractional share
will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between the cash received for the fractional share and the basis
allocable to such portion of the Dynamic common shares attributable to
the fractional share and such gain or loss likely will be capital gain
or loss.



A Dynamic preferred shareholder receiving cash for preferred
shares will recognize income or gain (or possibly loss, if the
Dynamic preferred shareholder does not own any Dynamic common
shares) in an amount equal to the difference between the cash
received for the preferred shares and the tax basis of the Dynamic
preferred shares exchanged.



Neither Cerner nor Dynamic will recognize any gain or loss as
a result of the merger.

     If the IRS successfully challenges the mergers status as a
reorganization, Dynamics common shareholders will have to recognize taxable
gain or loss on the difference between the (1) fair market value of the Cerner
common stock and (2) the tax basis of the Dynamic common shares exchanged.
This gain or loss would be treated as capital gain or loss. In that event, a
shareholders basis in the Cerner common stock received would equal its fair
market value, and the shareholder would begin a new holding period.

     The determination of the amount and character of income or gain with
respect to the redemption of preferred shares for cash is dependent on whether
the redemption constitutes a sale or exchange or a dividend for federal income
tax purposes. A sale or exchange and, consequently, capital gain or loss,
results if (1) the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend under
section 302(b)(1) of the Code, (2) the redemption is substantially
disproportionate under section 302(b)(2) of the Code, (3) the redemption is in
complete termination of the shareholders interest under section 302(b)(3) of
the Code or (4) the redemption is a partial liquidation under section 302(b)(4)
of the Code. In making such determination, certain stock attribution rules are
taken into account. In addition, if any portion of the cash received by
holders of Dynamic preferred shares is attributable to accrued dividends on the
Dynamic preferred shares which have been declared but not yet paid, such
amounts will be treated as dividend income.

     Dynamic common and preferred shareholders, other than certain exempt
recipients, may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 31% with respect
to cash received pursuant to the merger, unless the Dynamic shareholder either
(1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he or
she is not subject to backup withholding by completing the substitute Form W-9
that will be included as part of the transmittal letter or (2) otherwise proves
that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding.

     Dynamic common and preferred shareholders will also be required to file
certain information with their federal income tax returns and to retain certain
records with regard to the merger.

-36-



Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger
to each Dynamic shareholder will depend on the facts of each shareholders
situation. Dynamic shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax
advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the merger, including the
applicability and effect of any federal, state, local and foreign income and
other tax laws.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

     When you consider Dynamics board of directors recommendation to vote for
the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, you
should be aware of interests which some of the Dynamics directors and
executive officers have in the merger that are different from your interests as
Dynamic shareholders. Dynamics board was aware of these and other interests
and specifically considered them before approving and adopting the merger, the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.

Severance and Change of Control Arrangements. 
Dynamic has entered into
employment agreements with three of its officers, T. Christopher Assif, its
Chief Executive Officer, John P. Fingado, its President and Chief Operations
Officer, and Brian Greco, its Vice President of Finance. Pursuant to the terms
of their respective employment agreements, each of these officers is entitled,
under certain circumstances, to receive severance payments in the event of a
Change of Control. Under each of the employment agreements, these officers
generally are entitled to receive a lump severance payment based on their
then-current annual base compensation at the time of the Change of Control and
the acceleration of the vesting periods of all outstanding stock options,
warrants, and stock appreciation rights with respect to Dynamic common shares
held by them. The options, however, cannot be exercised until 12 months after
the original date of grant. In the event that they are entitled to a severance
payment upon a Change of Control, Messrs. Fingado and Greco would receive an
amount equal to one year of their respective annual base compensation and Mr.
Assif would receive an amount equal to one and one-half times his annual base
compensation. In addition, in such an event, 70% of the principal and interest
due on a note issued by Mr. Assif in favor of Dynamic (Assif Note) shall be
forgiven. The merger would constitute a Change of Control under the employment
agreement of each of Messrs. Assif, Fingado and Greco and it is expected that
each may be entitled to receive such payments and acceleration of their options
and stock appreciation rights. Following a transition period after the merger,
it is expected that Messrs. Assif and Greco will cease to be employed by
Cerner.

     Annual base salaries for Messrs. Assif, Fingado and Greco are $200,000,
$175,000, and $110,000, respectively. The Assif Note was issued by Mr. Assif
in favor of Dynamic in the principal amount of $242,720. Upon consummation of
the merger, it is expected that the total Change of Control payments payable
under the employment agreements with Messrs. Assif, Fingado and Greco will be
$766,571, which includes the forgiveness of $181,571 in principal amount plus
accrued interest with respect to the Assif Note as of September 30, 2001.

     Under terms of his employment and subsequent termination agreements with
Dynamic, Mitchel Laskey, a former CEO and current director of Dynamic, is
entitled to receive a payment of $100,000 in the event that the closing of the
merger takes place prior to December 31, 2001. In addition, upon a change of
control, Jerry L. Carson, a director and current employee of Dynamic, is
entitled to receive a payment of $18,000.

Stock Options and Warrants. 
Dynamic maintains employee stock option plans
that provide for the grant of incentive and non-qualified options as the
administrative committee of the Dynamic board shall determine. Certain stock
options held by Dynamic directors, officers and employees contain provisions
that cause the options to become fully vested in the event of a change of
control, such as in the proposed merger. The options, however, cannot be
exercised until 12 months after the original date of grant. Accordingly, such
warrants and options that have been outstanding for at least 12 months will be
immediately exercisable for shares of Cerner common stock following the closing
of the merger. Current executive officers hold options to purchase up to
223,504 Dynamic common shares (assuming full vesting under applicable change of
control provisions). However, only 123,335 options are exercisable at a price
equal to or less than proposed merger consideration as
determined on September 5, 2001.

     In connection with their service as directors of Dynamic and in partial
compensation therefor, Dynamic has granted warrants to its directors from time
to time. All such warrants are fully exercisable at the time of grant.
Directors and former directors as a group hold warrants to purchase up to
68,671 Dynamic common shares. Only 6,668 of these warrants are exercisable at a
price equal to or less than proposed merger consideration.

     The merger agreement provides that upon completion of the merger, each
outstanding option and warrant of Dynamic, whether or not vested, will be
converted into and become rights with respect to Cerner common stock. Cerner

-37-



will assume each option and warrant to acquire Dynamic common shares in
accordance with the terms of the stock option plan and the stock option
agreement under which it was granted, in the case of a stock option, or the
warrant agreement, in the case of a warrant except that:



Each Dynamic stock option or warrant assumed by Cerner may be
exercised solely for Cerner common stock; and



The number of shares of Cerner common stock subject to
post-merger stock options or warrants, as well as their respective
exercise prices, will be adjusted to account for the exchange ratio
used in the merger.

     In addition, all shares issued upon exercise of employee options will be
registered by Cerner under the Securities Act.

Ownership of Preferred Stock. 
Several directors and former directors and
executive officers of Dynamic are holders or beneficial owners of the Dynamic
preferred shares. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each Dynamic
preferred share will be redeemed at a price per share equal to $2.00 in cash,
plus all unpaid accrued dividends to which shareholders of such preferred
shares are entitled to receive. Bret R. Maxwell and Daniel Raynor, current
directors of Dynamic, beneficially own 930,000 Dynamic preferred shares, which
constitutes approximately 93% of the outstanding Dynamic preferred shares,
through their relationship with certain investors of Dynamic. The general
partner of Argentum Capital Partners, L.P., an investment partnership which
owns 290,000 Dynamic preferred shares, is BR Associates, Inc., a corporation to
which Mr. Raynor serves as chairman of the board. Mr. Maxwell is the ultimate
general partner of Riverside Partnership, an investment partnership which owns
640,000 preferred shares. In addition, Mr. Raynor, as a controlling person of
a beneficiary partnership of Riverside Partnership, is an indirect beneficial
owner of 50% of the preferred shares held by Riverside Partnership.

Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. 
The merger
agreement provides that, for a period of five years following the effective
time of the merger the directors and officers of Dynamic will continue to be
indemnified to the full extent permitted by applicable law and to the same
extent as provided for under the Dynamic Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
as in effect on the date of the merger agreement. In addition, Cerner has
agreed to cause the surviving corporation in the merger to continue to provide
these individuals with directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage for a period of five years following the effective
time of the merger to the extent that premiums for such coverage do not exceed
150% of the last annual premium paid by Dynamic for such coverage.

Conditions to the Merger

     Completion of the merger is subject to various conditions. While it is
anticipated that all such conditions will be satisfied, there can be no
assurance as to whether or when all of such conditions will be satisfied or,
where permissible, waived. The respective obligations of Cerner and Dynamic to
complete the merger are subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, including the following:

     There are no material regulatory approvals required to consummate the
merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

terminated, Dynamic has agreed to carry on its business in the ordinary course
in substantially the same manner as it was conducted prior to the execution of

No Solicitation

     Dynamic has agreed that it will not nor shall it authorize or knowingly
permit its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents or other advisors or representatives to (a) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any
acquisition proposal for Dynamic, (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action knowingly to

-40-



facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any acquisition proposal for Dynamic, (c) grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of Dynamic
capital stock or (d) enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition
proposal for Dynamic. Acquisition proposal for Dynamic means any offer or
proposal for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, issuance of securities, liquidation,
dissolution, tender offer or exchange offer or other similar transaction or
series of transactions involving, or any purchase of ten percent or more of the
assets, or directly or indirectly acquiring beneficial ownership of securities
representing, or exchangeable for or convertible into, more than ten percent of
the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Dynamic or in
which Dynamic issues securities representing ten percent of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of Dynamic, other than the
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.

     However, under the merger agreement, Dynamic is permitted to furnish
information to, and enter into negotiations with, a third party making a
takeover proposal if:



Dynamic receives from such third party an unsolicited
superior proposal of the type described below prior to the
approval of the merger agreement by Dynamic shareholders;



The Dynamic board of directors concludes in good faith, after
receiving advice from outside counsel and independent financial
advisor, that Dynamic must do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; and



Prior to doing so, Dynamic enters into reasonably customary
confidentiality and standstill agreements with such third party.

     Dynamic is required to notify Cerner immediately if any such negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued in respect of any such takeover
proposal, together with all of the relevant details of the negotiations.

Dynamic also generally will be required to pay the termination fee specified in
the merger agreement if its board of directors elects to (a) withdraw or modify
its approval or recommendation of the Cerner merger, (b) approve or recommend
any Superior Proposal, or (c) terminate the merger agreement with Cerner. 
Dynamic also may communicate
information about any takeover proposal to its shareholders if its board of
directors determines, based on advice of outside counsel and financial advisor,
that such communication is required under applicable law.

     Superior proposal for these purposes means any bona fide written
takeover proposal for all outstanding Dynamic common shares or all or
substantially all of the assets of Dynamic on terms which the board of
directors of Dynamic determines in its good faith judgment (based on a written
opinion of Dynamics financial advisor) to be materially more favorable to
Dynamic and its shareholders than the merger (taking into account any changes
to the financial and other contractual terms of the merger agreement proposed
by Cerner in response to such proposal, the person making the proposal, any
legal or regulatory considerations and all other relevant financial and
strategic considerations, including the timing of the consummation of such
transactions) and for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of
Dynamic, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

Waiver and Amendment

     Prior to or at the effective time of the merger, any provision of the
merger agreement, including, without limitation, the conditions to consummation
of the merger (except any condition which, if not satisfied, would result in
the violation of any law or governmental regulation, which violation would have
a material adverse effect on Cerner or Dynamic), may be (a) waived, to the
extent permitted under law, in writing by the party which is entitled to the
benefits thereof; or (b) amended at any time by written agreement of the
parties, whether before or after approval of the merger agreement by the
shareholders of Dynamic. However, no such amendment or modification may be
made after the Dynamic shareholder approval without the further approval of
such shareholders if required under any applicable law, rule or regulation.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

     The merger agreement and the merger may be terminated at any time prior to
the completion of the merger:



By mutual written consent of Cerner and Dynamic;

-41-





By Cerner or Dynamic, if the merger has not been consummated

be available to any party whose breach of any provision of the
merger agreement has resulted in the failure of the merger to occur
on or before such date;



By Cerner or Dynamic, if there shall be any law that makes
consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any

judgment, injunction, or order shall have become final and
nonappealable;



By Cerner or Dynamic, if the Dynamic shareholders do not
approve the merger agreement on or before February 28, 2002;



By Cerner or Dynamic, if there has been a material breach of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the other party in the merger agreement which shall constitute a
failure of a condition to the completion of the merger which
condition shall be incapable of being satisfied before February 28,
2002;



By Cerner, if there shall have occurred an adverse change in
the Dynamic board of directors recommendation that its shareholders
approve the merger;



By Cerner, if there shall have occurred a breach by Dynamic
or any of its officers, directors, employees, advisors or agents of
Dynamics covenant not to solicit, participate in or negotiate an
acquisition proposal;



By Cerner, if Dynamic fails to include the recommendation of
its board in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the approval of the merger in this proxy
statement/prospectus;



By Cerner, if the board of directors of Dynamic shall have
approved, endorsed or recommended any competing or alternative
acquisition proposal of Dynamic;



By Cerner, if a tender offer or exchange offer relating to
the securities of Dynamic shall have been commenced and Dynamic
shall not have sent to its shareholders, within ten business days
after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement
disclosing that Dynamic recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer;



By Dynamic, if it receives a bona fide superior proposal as
discussed above under No Solicitation on page      ;



By Dynamic, if all conditions to the merger, other than the
condition relating to Cerners average common stock price, have been
satisfied for at least 15 consecutive business days; or



Automatically, if the merger is enjoined by a court of
competent jurisdiction for a period extending beyond 90 days.

Effect of Termination

     If the merger agreement is terminated, it will thereafter become void and
there will be no liability on the part of Cerner or Dynamic or their respective
officers or directors, except that:



Any such termination will be without prejudice to the rights
of any party arising out of the willful breach by the other party of
any provision of the merger agreement;



Certain provisions of the merger agreement, including those
relating to confidential treatment of information will survive the
termination; and



Except as specifically set forth in the merger agreement,
Cerner and Dynamic each will bear its own expenses in connection
with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
except as otherwise provided therein.

-42-



     Dynamic has agreed to pay to Cerner upon demand
$2,000,000 (a) as a termination fee if Dynamic breaches certain covenants or
conditions of the merger agreement and such breach would entitle Cerner to
terminate the merger agreement including, but not limited to, Dynamics board
of directors withdrawing or modifying its recommendation to approve the merger
agreement in a manner adverse to Cerner or approving an acquisition proposal
as described under Stock Option Agreement  An Acquisition Proposal or (b) as
liquidated damages, in the event that all conditions under certain sections of
the agreement to Dynamics obligations to consummate the merger have been
satisfied, and Dynamic does not perform such obligations.

     Cerner has agreed to pay to Dynamic upon demand liquidated damages of
$2,000,000 in the event that all conditions under certain sections of the
agreement to Cerners obligations to consummate the merger have been satisfied,
and Cerner does not perform such obligations.

Nasdaq National Market Listing

     The Cerner common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market. Cerner
has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Cerner
common stock to be issued in the merger to be listed on the Nasdaq National
Market. It is a condition to completion of the merger that those shares be
listed on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

Effective Time

     It is presently anticipated that the effective time of the merger will
occur sometime during the fourth quarter of 2001. However, completion of the
merger could be delayed if there is a delay in satisfying any conditions to the
merger. There can be no assurances as to whether, or when, Cerner and Dynamic
will complete the merger. If the merger is not completed on or before February
28, 2002, either Cerner or Dynamic may terminate the merger agreement, unless
the failure to complete the merger by that date is due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform its covenants under
the merger agreement.

INFORMATION REGARDING DYNAMIC

Business

     Dynamic is a provider of NT, UNIX and AS/400 based diagnostic workflow
solutions for pathology, laboratory and radiology departments in approximately
640 customer sites, most located in the United States. Dynamic has designed,
developed and deployed advanced Internet and image, voice and Web-enabled
information systems for its customers that address a broad range of
requirements. Dynamics information systems contribute to higher quality and
more cost-effective delivery of care and make it possible to have access to
information across the entire continuum of care. Dynamic provides support for
all of its systems and also offers integration and other consulting services to
its customers.

     Dynamics systems automate ordering, scheduling, specimen and procedure
tracking, data/image acquisition from diagnostic equipment, store and archive
results. For years, Dynamic has provided the processing for clinical
information within the clinical departments of pathology, radiology and
laboratory, and has provided electronic integration with diagnostic images and
voice dictation.

The Company

     Dynamic was originally incorporated in California in 1977, reincorporated
in Nebraska in 1982 and subsequently reincorporated in Florida in 1996.
Dynamics executive offices are located at 615 Crescent Executive Court, Fifth
Floor, Lake Mary, Florida, 32746. In addition, Dynamics clinical solutions
center is located in Waltham, Massachusetts. The telephone number at the
executive offices of Dynamic is (407) 333-5300 and its World Wide Web address

Industry Background

     The healthcare industry continues to undergo rapid and significant change.
Cost containment pressures, industry consolidation, the increasing impact of
managed care, rising standards of healthcare quality, the shift from inpatient
to outpatient care settings, competition amongst healthcare providers,
increasing involvement of patients in their healthcare

- 43 -



delivery process, and
the demand for instant access to information on the part of physicians,
patients and payers represent fundamental trends in todays healthcare
operating environment. Although healthcare has been slower than other
industries to recognize the value of information technology, healthcare
providers recognize that the key to effective cost control and quality
management lies in the collection, availability and analysis of medical record
information to assess treatment patterns, resource utilization and outcomes.

Products and Services

     Dynamic uses the power of technology to improve diagnostic workflow for
pathology, laboratory and radiology services. Dynamics solutions enable health
professionals to have access to the clinical information they need to make
decisions and more effectively manage patient care. Although Dynamic has
various products and services, it does not maintain discrete financial
information by product line. Management does not review operating results by
product line to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
operating performance by product line. In addition, Dynamics product line is
marketed through a common distribution network and to a common customer base
almost exclusively in North America. Accordingly, management has determined
that it operates in a single reporting segment.

Pathology

     Dynamics anatomic pathology systems are scalable, client/server solutions
which are enabled with advanced voice, imaging and Web capabilities. Dynamic
CoPathPlus is a client/server anatomic pathology system that automates specimen
accessioning and case dictation, produces patient and management reports, and
provides SNOMED and natural language retrieval of diagnoses. CoPathPlus also
provides healthcare facilities with a flexible tool set that allows users to
modify specimen data entry windows and report formats. CoPathPlus is
image-enabled by capturing high-resolution digital images and permanently
storing those images electronically with related patient and diagnostic data.
CoPathPlus is also voice-enabled with a speech recognition solution, which
expedites the pathology dictation process and results in shorter turnaround
time in delivering patient reports to clinicians.

     Currently, the pathology product line has a dedicated sales force
consisting of four sales representatives. Pricing for Dynamics pathology
systems ranges from approximately $100,000 to over $1,000,000 for larger
hospital systems. These prices include licensed software, equipment and
implementation services. Annual support services are not included in the
systems price and typically equal approximately 18% of the software license
fee.

Laboratory

     The Premier Series laboratory information system (LIS) provides
functionality for specimen collection, testing and result reporting. The
Premier Series LIS supports bar coding, instrument interfaces, paperless
microbiology, multi-facility management and optical storage. Other features
include quality assurance workload recording and management reporting. The
Premier Series LIS integrates with highly specialized blood bank information
systems, providing both transfusion and donor service software as well as
regulatory products. The Premier Series LIS also complies with federal
regulations and assists laboratories in deciding upon the appropriate and
medically necessary course of action in diagnosing and treating patients.

     Currently, the laboratory product line has a dedicated sales force
consisting of two sales representatives. Pricing for Dynamics laboratory
systems ranges from approximately $150,000 to over $250,000 for larger hospital
systems. These prices include licensed software, equipment and
implementation services. Annual support services are not included in the
systems price and typically equal approximately 18% of the software license
fee.

Radiology

     Dynamics radiology solution combines advanced client/server architecture
with Web technology. Dynamics competitive position is enhanced by the close
relationship between its Radiology Information System (RIS), and its Picture
Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Information collected by
Dynamics RIS is available to the PACS, and images captured by the PACS are
available to the RIS. The result is an image-enabled RIS combined with an
information-enabled PACS. Primary markets for Dynamics radiology solutions
include hospitals, clinics and independent diagnostic imaging centers.

     Dynamic RadPlus is an image-enabled, client/server radiology information
system that includes scheduling, patient tracking, film tracking, remote
transcription, reporting and management of all radiology functions. Using
RadPlus,

- 44 -



facilities can adapt to change with tools, which allow users to make
screen modifications without the expense and delays of reprogramming by the
vendor. RadPlus also is voice-enabled with its continuous speech recognition
solution. In addition, remote transcriptionists have the ability to access
RadPlus over the Internet to transcribe, approve and disseminate radiology
reports to referring physicians. This Web-based connectivity feature improves
efficiency by reducing turnaround time in the patient report completion
process.

     As an integral part of RadPlus, Dynamic offers a PACS, which integrates
information from the RIS with images and provides access to this information.
CoMed for Results, a vital component of the PACS system, is a Web-based
teleradiology system that provides radiologists and physicians with extensive
access to radiology images and reports.

     The radiology product line has a dedicated sales force consisting of four
sales representatives. Pricing for Dynamics radiology systems ranges from
approximately $250,000 to over $1,000,000 for larger hospital systems. These
prices include licensed software, equipment and implementation services.
Annual support services are not included in the systems price and typically
equal approximately 18% of the software license fee.

CoMed

     In July 2000, Dynamic launched its CoMed Internet strategy. CoMed is
Dynamics solution for the industrys challenges in the capture and
dissemination of pertinent clinical and diagnostic information in any form.
CoMed, short for Collaborative Medicine, allows physicians, nurses and other
caregivers throughout the care delivery system to access and share information.

     Dynamic has developed its suite of CoMed Internet solutions to:



Enable clients to deliver clinical
transactions and
information to
their physician
populations quickly
and cost-effectively via a client branded, secure Web site; and



Allow clients with
limited capital and
resources to
purchase Dynamics
workflow solutions
via a subscription based Application Service Provider (ASP) model.

     Dynamic is developing and commercializing its Internet and software-based
medical information system products using the names CoMed for Results and CoMed
for Workflow Management. These products are designed to provide, through
Dynamics ASP facility, the ability for diagnostic clinical departments to
implement end-to-end clinical information systems and results distribution
using a secure Web environment. These products are intended to leverage
Dynamics expertise in providing traditional clinical information system
solutions for pathology, laboratory and radiology and expand their reach
through the use of current Internet technologies.

Consulting, Systems Integration and other Services

     Dynamic provides a full range of professional consulting services
including project management, implementation, planning, training and education.
Dynamics technical services include network design, implementation and
support, custom software development, interfaces, and modifications and systems
integration. Dynamic provides support services including 24-hour telephone
support and software maintenance and enhancements.

Research and Development

     Dynamics research and development program is designed to extend the
capabilities of existing products and develop new healthcare application
solutions. As of September 30, 2001, there were 28 employees engaged in
research and development activities. During the years ended December 31, 1998,
1999 and 2000, Dynamic spent approximately, $8,064,000, $6,806,000 and
$6,881,000, respectively, on research and development. The majority of
Dynamics research and development expenditures have been directed toward

Dynamic RadPlus , 
C
oPathPlus 
, 
Premier Series LIS and CoMed 
product
lines.

Major Clients

     Dynamic does not have a dependence on any single customer, the loss of
which would have a material adverse effect on continuing operations. Dynamic
does generate revenue almost exclusively through sales to the healthcare
industry located in the United States. Due to this concentration,
substantially all receivables of Dynamic are from healthcare

- 45 -



institutions which
may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other industry
related conditions. Dynamic currently has approximately 640 customers. The
majority of these customers are located within the United States.

Backlog

     As of June 30, 2001, Dynamic has a combined backlog of approximately $23.5
million. Dynamic had contracts for the delivery of systems and services
totaling approximately $9.9 million on June 30, 2001, compared to $9.2 million
on June 30, 2000. In addition, as of June 30, 2001, Dynamic had contracts for
the delivery of software support services billable at an annual rate of $13.6
million, compared to $12.1 million as of June 30, 2000.

Sales and Marketing

     As of September 30, 2001, Dynamic had 16 full time employees in sales and
marketing related functions. Dynamic had 11 sales employees and 5 marketing
employees. The compensation of the sales employees is substantially dependent
on the achievement of individual sales targets. Marketing personnel perform
telemarketing, proposal development, demonstration coordination, develop
business plans and product marketing programs, competitive analyses, sales
collateral, audio and video products, coordinate trade shows, advertising,
public relations, investor relations activities, and administrative support.

     Dynamics sales cycle is typically six to eighteen months and includes
several steps:

(i)

Customers

     Dynamic currently serves more than 640 customers, most located in the
United States. Key customers include Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
The Mayo Foundation, The University of North Carolina Hospitals, LabCorp,
Valley Health System, St. Marys Health System, Parkland Memorial Hospital,
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York Hospital and Northwest Radiology
Network.

Competition

     The market for information technology in the healthcare industry is
intensely competitive. Many of Dynamics competitors have significantly greater
financial, research and development technical and marketing resources than
Dynamic. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products
and services they offer. Dynamics systems compete both with other
technologies and with similar systems developed by other companies. Other
major information management companies, including the companies with whom
Dynamic has strategic relationships, may enter the markets in which Dynamic
competes. In addition, in the professional and technical consulting segment,
Dynamic competes with the consulting divisions of national accounting firms as
well as national and regional healthcare specialty consulting firms.

Government Regulation

     The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has issued a
guidance document addressing the regulation of certain computer products as
medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA). To
the extent that computer software is classified as a medical device under
applicable regulations, the manufacturers of such products are required,
depending upon the product, to: register and list their products with the FDA
(Class I), notify the FDA and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other
products on the market before marketing such products (Class II) or, obtain
FDA clearance by filing a Pre Market Application (PMA) that establishes the
safety and effectiveness of the product (Class III). As a result of the
characterization of certain of Dynamics products as medical devices, Dynamics
manufacturing facilities are registered with the FDA and its manufacturing
operations regarding devices are required to be in compliance with the FDAs
Quality System Regulations (QSR). Dynamic currently has one product classified
as a Class I Medical Device, Premier Series LIS, and one product currently
classified as a Class II Medical Device, PACSPlus. A second product that was
also classified as a Class II Medical Device, Transfusion Service Manager
(TSM), was retired effective June 30, 2000. Both PACSPlus and TSM products
were deemed substantially equivalent and had 510(k) clearance letters issued by
the FDA. The most recent FDA on-site inspection of Dynamics Corporate
Headquarters in Lake Mary, FL, occurred in August 1999, and concluded without
incident. There can be no assurance that Dynamic ultimately will be able to
obtain or maintain required FDA approvals to market its products.

     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),
has a direct impact on the ASP portion of Dynamics business and an indirect
effect on Dynamic as a Business Associate of its customers, the healthcare
providers. Dynamic has monitored HIPAA progress throughout its implementation
and has proactively taken steps to ensure Dynamic responded appropriately. All
of Dynamics existing products have been assessed against the proposed and
finalized HIPAA regulations and the ASP business unit was developed with HIPAA
security in the forefront. We are confident we will be able to provide software
that will assist our customers in achieving their HIPAA compliance.

Intellectual Property

     Dynamic relies upon trade secrets, copyright laws and confidentiality
agreements with employees and customers to protect its rights in its software
technology. Dynamic does not hold any patents nor has it
filed copyrights with respect to any of its software technology. Due to the
rapid pace of innovation within the software industry, Dynamic believes that
patent, trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than
Dynamics ability to further develop, enhance and modify its current products
and other clinical information systems through the technology and creative
skills of its personnel. To minimize the possibility of third parties
imitating Dynamics systems, Dynamic licenses object codes only and does not
license or otherwise distribute source codes.

     Dynamics employees are required to enter into confidentiality agreements
which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and which require
employees to report and assign to Dynamic all concepts, developments,
discoveries and inventions conceived during their employment.

     Dynamic has obtained federal trademark protection for DynamicVision,
CoPath, Maxifile, Optima, Dynamic CoPath Plus, Dynamic RadPlus, and
Dynamic PACSPlus. There can be no assurance that the legal protections and
precautions taken by Dynamic will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of
Dynamics technology. In addition, these protections do not prevent
independent third-party development of functionally equivalent or superior
technologies or services. Dynamic does not believe its operations or products
infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. There can be no
assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims
against Dynamic with respect to its current or future products or that Dynamic
will be successful in defending any such claim.

Employees

     As of September 30, 2001, Dynamic had 138 full time employees, of which
28 were employed in research and development, 78 in client services, 16 in
general and administrative and 16 in sales and marketing. None of Dynamics
employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining
agreement. Dynamic has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its
employee relations are good.

Properties

     Dynamics corporate headquarters are located at 615 Crescent Executive
Court, Suite 600, Lake Mary, Florida 32746. The Lake Mary location consists of
approximately 53,800 square feet of office space under a lease that expires

- 47 -



March 1, 2005. In addition, Dynamic also maintains an office at Two University
Office Park, 51 Sawyer Road, Waltham, Massachusetts 02154 as Dynamics clinical
solutions center. The Waltham location consists of approximately 30,000 square
feet under lease that expires November 30, 2004. Dynamic believes that its
current facilities are sufficient to meet its near-term requirements.

Legal Proceedings

     Dynamic periodically will be a party to or otherwise involved in legal
proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Management does not
believe that there is any proceeding threatened or pending against Dynamic
which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect on the business or
financial position of Dynamic on a consolidated basis.

DYNAMICS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

     Dynamic is a provider of mission-critical healthcare information systems
for clinical services departments and facilities throughout North America.
Dynamics product line includes a suite of image-, voice-, and web-enabled
systems for anatomic pathology, radiology, and laboratory information
management systems. Dynamics services include implementation and training,
product management and client software development.

     Revenues from professional services and maintenance and support services
typically increase as the number of installed systems increases. Computer
system equipment sales revenues are generally recognized when hardware is
shipped. Computer system equipment sales and support revenues include hardware
support contracts for a specific period from which revenue is recognized
ratably over the corresponding contract period. Application software license
revenues are recognized when application software is delivered to the client.
Installation and training service revenues, included with application software
licenses, are recognized as the services are performed. Software support
revenues principally include contracts for remote dial-up problem diagnosis,
maintenance and corrective support services, each of which covers a specified
period for which revenue is recognized ratably over the corresponding contract
period. Services and other revenues include custom programming services,
post-contract support obligations and other services, which are provided under
separate contract and are recognized as services are performed.

     Cost of products sold includes the cost of hardware sold, costs of third
party software licenses and hardware support subcontracts. Client service
expense includes the direct and indirect costs associated with implementation
and support personnel. Software development costs include the direct and
indirect salaries and wages of software research and development personnel,
direct research and development expenses, reduced by capitalized software
development costs. Software development costs are expensed until such time as
technological feasibility is established and then are capitalized in compliance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 Accounting for Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Software
amortization is separately stated. Sales and marketing costs include direct
and indirect salaries, commissions, joint marketing costs, advertising, trade
show costs, user group cost and travel and entertainment expenses related to
the sale and marketing of Dynamics products and services. General and
administrative expenses include salaries and expenses for corporate
administration, financial, legal and human resources.

     The sales cycle for Dynamics systems is typically six to eighteen months
from initial contact to contract signing. The product delivery cycle is
variable. Based on the clients implementation plan, product delivery may take
two or more years, particularly with enterprise-wide electronic healthcare
record solutions involving significant and continuing client service
requirements. Accordingly, the product delivery cycle depends upon the
combination of products purchased and the implementation plan defined by the
client in the master sales agreement. Each client contract is separately
negotiated. The installation schedules for clinical information systems, or
departmental electronic healthcare record implementations, typically require
six to twelve months. Under its standard master sales agreement, Dynamic
generally receives a partial payment upon execution of the agreement, a
hardware installment payment upon delivery of hardware, installation progress
payments upon the completion of defined milestones and final payment, which may
vary with each contract.

     This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations presents a review of the operating results and financial
condition of Dynamic for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998 and for the six month periods ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. This
discussion and analysis is intended to assist in

- 48 -



understanding the financial
condition and results of operations of Dynamic. Accordingly, this section
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related
notes contained herein.

Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 and 2000

Revenues. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2001 Dynamic reported
revenues of $12,552,000 a decrease of $496,000 or 3.8% from revenues of
$13,048,000 for the same period in 2000. Revenues from new system
implementations declined slightly principally due to a general market slowdown
caused by reduced capital procurement by healthcare providers. Combined
revenues from computer system equipment sales, application software licenses,
and services and other revenues declined by $449,000, reflecting this decrease
in new system implementations, while software support revenues decreased
modestly by $47,000.

     Computer system equipment sales and support revenues decreased by $37,000
to 4.3% of total revenues for the six month period ended 2001, compared to 4.4%
for the six months ended 2000. Management attributes the slight decrease to
the clients procurement of needed hardware directly from the manufacturer.

     Application software license revenue during the six months ended June 30,
2001 decreased by $259,000 over the same period one year ago, from $3,506,000
to $3,247,000, and similarly service and other revenues decreased by $154,000
to $2,989,000 from $3,143,000. These decreases principally result from the
decreased implementation of new systems.

     Software support revenues modestly decreased by $46,000 to $5,780,000 for
the six months ended June 30, 2001, compared to $5,826,000 for the same period
one year ago. During 2000 Dynamic discontinued support for customers operating
our offering of MUMPS radiology products, this decrease is due primarily to
customers not converting to our

- 49 -



client server offering. Management expects
support revenues to continue to grow with the implementation of new systems.
As of June 30, 2001, the recurring annualized billable support base was $12.4
million, and an additional $1.2 million of annualized software support revenue
is anticipated to be generated from delivery of Dynamics existing new systems
backlog.

Cost of Products Sold. 
Cost of products sold as a percentage of total
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2001 increased to 8.2% from 7.5% for
the same period in 2000. Hardware and application software license revenues
during the first six months of 2001 similarly decreased to 30.2% from
31.3% of total revenues for the first six months of 2000, due to the
decrease in new system implementations.

Client Services Expense. 
Client services expense for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 decreased $424,000 to $4,723,000 from $5,147,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2000, decreasing as a percentage of total revenues from
39.5% to 37.6%. Dynamic previously reported a decrease in duplicative staffing
and a reallocation of various resources in connection with the realignment plan
completed in 2001. Product installation, delivery and support services were
standardized along all product lines as Dynamic focuses on revenue generating
functions.

Software Development Costs. 
Software development costs for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 decreased to 17.4% of total revenues from 18.0% incurred
during the six months ended June 30, 2000. The $183,000 decrease in software
development expense reported for the six months ended June 30, 2001 of
$2,168,000, compared to $2,351,000 reported for the six months ended June 30,
2000, reflects a $1,054,000 reduction in capitalized software development costs
offset by other reductions in total software departmental costs of $871,000
through the reduction and reallocation of personnel to various departments.
Although development efforts continue as part of Dynamics overall strategy,
the focus has been less on enhancements to existing product lines and more
towards completion of Dynamics e-Business initiatives. Cost incurred in
connection with Dynamics e-Business initiatives were not capitalized since the
development of the products have not yet reached technological feasibility.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 21.4% from 17.1%
for the same period of 2000. This increase of $460,000 from $2,227,000 to
$2,687,000 in sales and marketing expenses results principally from the
increase of $317,000 in sales commissions paid as a result of an increase in
the relative sales bookings. The remaining $143,000 increase is primarily due
to increased marketing activity to promote Dynamics new CoMeD product and
market awareness of existing products.

General and Administrative. 
General and administrative expenses for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 increased $297,000 to $2,255,000 from $1,958,000
for the six months ended June 30, 2000, and increased as a percentage of total
revenues to 17.9% from 15.0%. The increase in expense is associated with
direct increases in travel and entertainment, bad debt, legal, supplies, and
Dynamics business activities specifically relating to compliance with NASDAQ.

Realignment Cost. 
During the second quarter 2001, Dynamic adopted a
formal plan to reallocate and eliminate selected mid-level management and
duplicate staff positions in Dynamic. In connection with the plan, a total of
thirty-six employees were terminated and Dynamic incurred a non-recurring
charge in the amount of $465,204 related to termination and severance benefits.
At June 30, 2001, $363,754 was paid and $101,450 of the remaining accrued
severance and termination benefits will be paid by December 31, 2001.

Other Income (expense). 
Dynamic incurred $64,000 of net other expense for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 compared to $62,000 of net other expense
reported for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The net increase of $2,000 in
other expense is principally due to the $32,000 increase in other income and
expense and a reduction of $30,000 for loss on disposal of fixed assets that
occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2000.

Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999

Revenues. 
During the year ended December 31, 2000 Dynamic reported
revenues of $25,659,000 a decrease of $9,484,000 from revenues of $35,143,000
for 1999. Revenues from new system implementations declined significantly
principally due to general market slowdown caused by reduced capital
procurement by healthcare providers. Combined revenues from computer system
equipment sales, application software licenses, and services and other revenues
declined by $9,535,000, reflecting this decrease in new system implementations,
while software support revenues increased modestly by $51,000. Dynamics
radiology revenues decreased by $3,947,000, from $9,479,000 recognized during
1999 to $5,532,000 recognized during 2000. Pathology revenues for 2000 decreased
by $2,724,000 to $12,011,000 from

- 50 -



$14,735,000 during 1999. Similarly,
laboratory revenues for 2000 also decreased by $1,200,000 to $7,045,000 from
$8,245,000 during 1999. In addition, Records Plus product line revenues
decreased by $1,455,000 from $2,526,000 reported for 1999 to $1,071,000 for
2000.

     Computer system equipment sales and support revenues decreased by
$3,274,000 to 4.0% of total revenues for 2000, compared to 12.3% for 1999.
Management attributes the decrease to the decreased implementation of new
systems by customers focused on year 2000 remediation and system validation
efforts.

     Application software license revenue during 2000 decreased by $2,624,000
as compared to 1999, from $9,745,000 to $7,121,000, and service and other
revenues decreased by $3,637,000 to $5,749,000 from $9,386,000, principally
resulting from the decreased implementation of new systems during 2000.

     Software support revenues increased by $51,000 to $11,767,000 for 2000,
compared to $11,716,000 for the same period one year ago. During 1999, Dynamic
discontinued support for a limited offering of legacy laboratory and financial
products in connection with Year 2000 remediation efforts. Management expects
support revenues to grow with the implementation of new systems. As of
December 31, 2000, the recurring annualized billable support base was $12.3
million.

Cost of Products Sold. 
Cost of products sold as a percentage of total
revenues for 2000 decreased to 9.0% from 17.8% for 1999. Computer system
equipment sales and support revenues during 2000 similarly decreased to 4.0%
from 12.3% of total revenues for 1999, due to the significant decrease in new
system implementations.

Software Amortization. 
Software amortization for 2000 decreased by
approximately $198,000 from $2,078,000 during 1999 to $1,880,000. During 2000
Dynamic abandoned marketing of DynamicVision and PACSPlus for strategic
reasons, which lowered the recurring amortization.

Client Services Expense. 
Client services expense for 2000 decreased
$24,000 to $9,856,000 from $9,880,000 for 1999, increasing as a percentage of
total revenues from 28.1% to 38.4%. Dynamic previously reported decreased
staffing in connection with the re-engineering and cost reduction plan
completed in 1998. Product installation, delivery and support services were
standardized along all product lines as Dynamic centralized these functions.
However, during late 1999 and continuing through the first quarter of 2000
Dynamic transitioned various development personnel to support and new system
implementation roles, consistent with the maturing of the recent new product
releases, which offset these decreases.

Software Development Costs. 
Software development costs for 2000 increased
to 20.2% of total revenues from 13.4% incurred during 1999. The $466,000
increase in software development expense reported for 2000 of $5,176,000,
compared to $4,710,000 reported for 1999, results principally from resources
committed to the development of Dynamics e-Business initiatives, which have
not been capitalized. In addition, development efforts continue as part of
Dynamics overall growth strategy, including enhancements to existing product
lines.

Sales and Marketing. 
Sales and marketing costs for 2000 as a percentage
of total revenues, decreased to 17.6% from 18.7% for the same period of 1999.
This decrease of $2,081,000 from $6,589,000 to $4,508,000 in sales and
marketing expenses results principally from cost reductions attributed to the
sales realignment programs completed in 1999 and a decrease in sales
commissions as a result of reduced new system bookings during 2000.

General and Administrative. 
General and administrative costs increased by
$562,000 to $4,631,000 for 2000 compared to $4,069,000 for 1999, and increased
as a percentage of total revenues to 18.1% from 11.6%. Costs related to the
management of Dynamics e-Business initiatives is being charged to general and
administrative costs, and the restructured organization allocates a higher
percentage of overhead burdens to the general administrative department as result of the
department constituting a higher percentage of Company-wide salaries and wages.
In addition, bad debt charges for 2000 increased by $135,000, principally as a
result of the discontinued product offerings during 2000, and a $300,000
severance charge was taken in connection with the transition of Dynamics
former CEO to Senior Advisor in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Restructuring Costs. 
During the third quarter 2000, Dynamic adopted a
formal plan to stop marketing and further development of specific products,
and, as a result, recorded restructuring charges of $5,725,007. In connection
with Dynamics strategic decision to focus marketing efforts on Dynamics
clinical suite of products (CoPathPlus, RadPlus and e-Premier) and its
e-Business initiatives (CoMed Internet), Dynamic decided to no longer actively
market SurgiPlus,

- 51 -



DynamicVision and PACSPlus. Historical revenues from the
discontinued products were approximately $1,071,000 and $2,526,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The affected product
charges consist of the write-off of net capitalized software costs of
$4,998,234 and a write-off of prepaid licenses of $130,624. In addition,
employee severance and termination costs, associated with positions eliminated
as a result of the abandoned product offerings, in the amount of $399,735 and a
reserve for contract losses of $196,414 were accrued and expensed during the
third quarter of 2000. A total of 32 employees were terminated in connection
with the abandoned product offerings.

Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 1998

Revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 1999 Dynamic reported
revenues of $35,143,000, an increase of $9,314,000 or 36% from revenues of
$25,829,000 for 1998. Dynamics radiology system revenues increased by
$4,416,000, from $5,063,000 recognized during the 1998 to $9,479,000 recognized
during 1999. Pathology revenue for 1999 increased by $3,909,000 to $14,735,000
from $10,826,000 during 1998. Similarly, laboratory information system
revenues for 1999 also increased by $643,000 to $8,245,000 from $7,603,000
during 1998. Revenues from the Records Plus product line increased by $592,000
from $1,934,000 to $2,526,000 comparing 1998 to 1999, respectively. During
1997 Dynamic introduced new technology product releases in virtually every
market segment in which Dynamic competes. Lengthy initial sales cycles
significantly impacted 1998 performance, while record fourth quarter 1998 sales
bookings, and the resulting record high new systems backlog as of December 31,
1998, resulted in increased system implementations during 1999.

     Computer system equipment sales and support revenues increased by
$1,659,000 to 12.3% of total revenues for 1999 compared to 10.2% for 1998.
Management attributed the increase to the increased implementation of new
system sales.

     Application software license revenue during 1999 increased by $4,349,000
over 1998, from $5,396,000 to $9,745,000, and similarly, service and other
revenue increased by $3,313,000 to $9,386,000 from $6,073,000. These increases
principally result from the increased implementation of new system sales.

     Software support revenues modestly decreased by $7,000 to $11,716,000 for
1999, compared to $11,723,000 for 1998. During 1998 Dynamic announced the
discontinuance of support for a limited offering of legacy laboratory and
financial products in connection with Year 2000 remediation efforts. As of
December 31, 1999, the recurring annualized billable support base was $12.3
million, and an additional $2.3 million of annualized software support revenue
was anticipated to be generated from delivery of Dynamics existing new systems
backlog.

Cost of Products Sold. 
Cost of products sold as a percentage of total
revenues for 1999 increased to 17.8% from 12.6% for 1998. Hardware and
application software license revenues during 1999 similarly increased to 40.0%
from 31.1% of total revenues for 1998, due to the significant increase in new
system implementations.

Client Services Expense.

Client services expense for 1999 decreased
$1,078,000 to $9,880,000 from $10,958,000 for 1998, decreasing as a percentage
of total revenues from 42.4% to 28.1%. Dynamic previously reported decreased
staffing in connection with the re-engineering and cost reduction plan
completed in 1998. Product installation, delivery and support services were
standardized along all product lines as Dynamic centralized these functions.

Software Development Costs. 
Software development costs for 1999 decreased
to 13.4% of total revenues from 18.9% incurred during 1998. This $180,000 net
decrease in software development expense resulted despite a $1,078,000
reduction in capitalized software development costs from $3,174,000 capitalized
during 1998 to $2,096,000 capitalized during 1999, which increased the expense.
In effect, a real reduction in total software development departmental costs
of $1,258,000 occurred in 1999, as compared to 1998.

Sales and Marketing. 
Sales and marketing costs for 1999 as a percentage
of total revenues, decreased to 18.7% from 36.5% for the same period of 1998.
This decrease of $2,840,000 from $9,430,000 to $6,590,000 in sales and
marketing expenses was despite an increase in sales commissions incurred for
1999 of $462,000 from $1,063,000 incurred during 1998 to $1,525,000 incurred
during 1999, resulting from increased sales closings. This translates to a
base sales and marketing cost reduction of approximately $3,302,000 attributed
to the sales realignment program undertaken in 1998, in connection with
Dynamics cost reduction plan.

General and Administrative Expenses. 
General and administrative expenses
for 1999 decreased by $536,000 and decreased to 11.6% of total revenues from
17.8% incurred during 1998. This decrease was despite an

- 52 -



increase of $382,000
in amounts accrued under Dynamics Management Incentive Compensation Plan (MIC
Plan). Dynamic did not pay any MIC Plan compensation for 1998. General and
administrative costs for 1999 compared to the same period in 1998, include
reductions in salaries and professional services of $544,000, office rent
expense of $164,000 telephone expenses of $269,000, supplies of $72,000 and
mail delivery costs of $49,000, principally attributed to the office
consolidation and realignment efforts.

Restructuring Costs. 
During the third quarter of 1999 Dynamic announced a
restructuring plan. This restructuring was designed to provide a single focus
to the development, marketing, sales and support of Dynamics information
systems. It also established specific cost reductions, revenue improvement and
customer satisfaction objectives and anticipated future cost efficiencies. In
connection with the plan, a total of 17 employees were terminated and Dynamic
incurred $524,000 of termination charges.

Other Income (Expense). 
Dynamic incurred $202,000 of net other expense
for 1999 compared to $41,000 of net other income reported for 1998. Net
interest income was $180,000 during 1998 as compared to net interest expense
during 1999 of $176,000 due to the cash used by operating and investing
activities during 1998, and increased borrowings on the line of credit during
1999. In addition, Dynamic incurred approximately $139,000 in losses on sale
of fixed assets in connection with the office consolidation in 1998 and $26,000
in 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Dynamic has historically financed its operations primarily through cash
flow from operations, public and private equity offerings of its securities,
and bank financing, including the financing facility discussed below. Dynamic
has experienced positive cash flow from operations for 11 consecutive quarters.
As of June 30, 2001 Dynamic had cash and cash equivalents of $893,094,
availability under the line of credit of $1,500,000, and a working capital
deficit of $792,000, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $3,198,000,
availability under the line of credit of $2,875,000, and a working capital
deficit of $314,000 at December 31, 2000. The decrease in cash and cash
equivalents was primarily as a result of $2,875,000 in payment against the line
of credit borrowings and additional severance paid in connection with the
realignment plan implemented in April 2001. The increase in working capital
deficit occurred primarily due to additional accrued liabilities associated
with the realignment plan in April 2001.

     Our cash flows are impacted positively to the extent our accounts
receivable are greater than our accounts payable and negatively, to the extent
our accounts receivable are less than our accounts payable. Accounts
receivable as of June 30, 2001 decreased by $1,542,000 from the balance on
December 31, 2000, principally as a result of the increased collection
activities for support renewals and decreases in new system installations.
Unbilled receivables increased by $1,118,000 due principally to the timing of
billable milestones on implementations and the increase of contract work in
progress.

     Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $328,000 to $2,734,000 as
of June 30, 2001 from $3,061,000 as of December 31, 2000. The lower level of
system implementations resulted in a lower level of accrued third party product
costs.

     Advanced billings as of June 30, 2001 increased by $796,000 to $1,993,000
from the 2000 year end balance of $1,197,000. The increase in sales bookings
for the first quarter of 2001 resulted in a higher level of client contract
deposits received and therefore, an increase in our liquidity.

     Dynamics line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank was renegotiated on July
25, 2001 and expires on July 24, 2002. The new line of credit is intended to
provide for up to $2,500,000 of borrowings based on a maximum advanced ratio
equal to 80% of qualified accounts receivable. Borrowings as of September 30,
2001 were $0. Future borrowing capacity is contingent on Dynamics compliance
with a minimum quick asset ratio (as defined) of 1.00 to 1.00. Due to the
cyclical nature of Dynamics operations or as the result a significant increase
in expenses due to extraordinary events or otherwise (including the costs of
the proposed merger with Cerner), Dynamic faces the risk of non-compliance with
the quick asset ratio requirement, which could result in the reduction or
removal of Dynamics available line of credit. In addition to the line of
credit, Cerner has agreed to loan up to $500,000 to Dynamic, if necessary, to
finance the additional costs associated with the pending merger transaction.

     Management believes that existing cash and funds available under its
existing line of credit, together with funds expected to be generated by
operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements. However,
Dynamics ability to meet its future working capital requirements is dependent
on Dynamics ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from
operations and to have availability under its existing line of credit or to
obtain suitable additional financing.

- 53 -



     As a result of the realignment plan adopted by Dynamic in April 2001 to
eliminate and reallocate resources, a total of 36 employees were terminated and
Dynamic incurred a non-recurring charge in the amount of $465,204 related to
termination and severance benefits. At September 30, 2001, $414,479 was paid
and $50,725 of the remaining accrued severance and termination benefits will be
paid by December 31, 2001.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Dynamic is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its
variable rate line of credit used to finance Dynamics short-term working
capital needs and general corporate purposes. Dynamics interest rate risk
management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earning
and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs.

     Dynamics market risks associated with its line of credit borrowings
outstanding is that the interest rate under the line of credit agreement is
based on the prime rate plus (3.0%) (8.50% as of September 30, 2001). The line
of credit agreement expires on July 24, 2002. Fair value of the line of credit
as of September 30, 2001 was equal to its carrying value of $0.

Inflation and Changing Prices

     Dynamic believes that the general state of the economy and inflationary
trends have only a limited effect on its business. Historically, inflation has
not had a material effect on Dynamic. Changing prices of computer hardware
could have a material effect on the cost of the materials sold and the related
selling price of software and hardware sales. Dynamic anticipates that the recent
terrorist actions occurring in the United States on September 11, 2001 will
result in increased costs relating to its sales activities, which are highly
dependent on air travel. It is expected that air travel costs will increase
and that travel delays may be experienced from time to time.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), and No 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase
method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method
of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS
141 also requires that Dynamic recognize acquired intangible assets apart from
goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria. SFAS 141
applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and for
purchase business combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001. It also
requires, upon adoption of SFAS 142 that Dynamic reclassify the carrying
amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in SFAS 141.

     SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that companies no longer amortize
goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In
addition, SFAS 142 requires that Dynamic identify reporting units for the
purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and reassess the
useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be
tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 is
required to be applied in fiscal years beginning when those assets were
initially recognized. SFAS 142 requires Dynamic to complete a transitional
goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption. Dynamic is also
required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the
first interim quarter after adoption of SFAS 142.

     Dynamics previous business combinations were accounted for using the
purchase method. As of September 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of
goodwill is $558,392. Amortization expense during the six-month period ended
September 30, 2001 was $290,544. Currently, Dynamic is assessing but has not
yet determined how the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will impact its
financial position and results of operations.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     The rights of Dynamic shareholders are currently governed by Florida law
and Dynamics articles of incorporation and bylaws. As a result of the merger,
the shareholders of Dynamic will become shareholders of Cerner, whose rights
are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and Cerners certificate
of incorporation and bylaws. The following discussion is intended only to
highlight certain differences between the rights of corporate shareholders
under Florida law and Delaware law generally and specifically with respect to
the shareholders of Dynamic and Cerner. The discussion is not intended as a
complete statement of all such differences, and Dynamic shareholders are
referred to those laws and governing documents for a definitive treatment of
the subject matter.

Certain Differences Between Florida and Delaware Corporation Statutes

Shareholder Approval of Certain Corporate Transactions. 
The Delaware law
requires that a merger, consolidation, disposition of all or substantially all
the assets or voluntary dissolution of a corporation be approved by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote thereon (except as indicated below). The Delaware law also requires that
mergers and dispositions of all or substantially all of the corporations
assets be approved by the board of directors. Under the Delaware law,
shareholder approval is not required for mergers in which (a) the certificate
of incorporation of the surviving corporation is not amended, (b) shares of the
surviving corporation outstanding before the merger are unchanged, and (c) new
shares to be issued in the merger do not exceed 20 percent of the shares
outstanding before the merger.

     Under Florida law, a merger, share exchange, and a sale, lease, exchange,
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation
must be approved by the board of directors and approved by the affirming vote
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to
vote thereon, unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors
require a greater vote. The board of directors must recommend the action
unless it makes no recommendation due to special circumstances that it
communicates to the shareholders. Shareholder approval is not necessary for a
merger between a parent corporation and subsidiary of which the parent
corporation controls at least 80% of all the outstanding classes of equity and
there will be no change to the articles of incorporation which would otherwise
require shareholder approval. In addition, shareholder approval is not
necessary, and dissenters rights are not available, for mergers by
corporations reorganizing themselves as a holding company if such corporations
shares are traded on a national exchange or on the interdealer quotation system
by the NASD, or such shares are held of record by at least 2,000 shareholders.

- 55 -



Amendment of Charter. 
The Delaware law requires that an amendment to a
Delaware corporations certificate of incorporation first be adopted by the
board of directors before the amendment is submitted to the shareholders for
approval by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote thereon.

     Florida law also generally requires an amendment to the articles of
incorporation of a Florida corporation to be adopted by the board of directors
before the amendment is recommended and submitted to the shareholders of the
corporation for approval. Unless the articles of incorporation provide for a
greater shareholder vote, Florida law generally requires that the votes cast in
favor of such an amendment must exceed the votes cast against such an amendment
at a meeting that at least a quorum is present; provided, however, that a
majority of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast on the amendment is
required with respect to an amendment that would create dissenters rights
under Florida law. Further, under Florida law shareholder approval is not
required for certain non-material amendments.

Dissenters Appraisal Rights. 
The Delaware law grants appraisal rights
only in connection with mergers and consolidations, and grants no appraisal
rights with respect to mergers in which:



dissenting shares are

(a)

listed on a national securities exchange or
designated as a national market system security on an
interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., or

(b)

held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, or



the corporation is the surviving corporation in the merger
and no vote of its shareholders is required under the Delaware law,
with certain exceptions.

     Under Florida law, dissenters appraisal rights are available in
connection with corporate actions involving certain mergers, share exchanges,
consolidations, sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all of the
property of the corporation (other than in the ordinary course of business),
the approval of certain control-share acquisitions, and amendments of the
articles of incorporation where such amendment would adversely affect the
shareholder by:



altering or abolishing any preemptive rights attached
to such shareholders shares;



altering or abolishing the voting rights pertaining to
such shareholders shares, except as such rights may be affected
by the voting rights of new shares then being authorized of any
existing or new class or series of shares;



effecting an exchange, cancellation, or
reclassification of any of such shareholders shares, when such
amendment would alter or abolish the shareholders voting rights
or alter his or her percentage of equity in the corporation, or
effecting a reduction or cancellation of accrued dividends or
other arrearages;



reducing the stated redemption price of any of the
shareholders redeemable shares, altering or abolishing any
provision relating to any sinking fund for the redemption or
purchase of any of his or her shares, or making any of the
shareholders shares subject to redemption when they are not
otherwise redeemable;



making non-cumulative, in whole or in part, dividends
on any of his or her preferred shares which had theretofore been
cumulative;



reducing the dividend preference of any of his or her
preferred shares; or



reducing any stated preferential amount payable on the
shareholders preferred shares upon voluntary or involuntary
liquidation.

     No dissenters rights are granted under Florida law in the case of a
merger or share exchange or a proposed sale or exchange of property when the
Florida corporations shares are listed on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq National Market or held of record by at least 2,000 persons.

- 56 -



Anti-takeover Statutes. 
The Delaware law contains a business combination
moratorium statute that generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from
engaging in mergers or other business combinations with any person who is an
interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes
an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions are satisfied.

     Florida law contains two statutes that addresses control share
acquisitions and affiliated transactions.

Control Share Acquisitions.
 This statute applies to Florida corporations
with at least 100 or more shareholders and has a substantial nexus with the
state as specified in the statute. Florida law substantially restricts the
voting rights of certain shares of a Florida corporations stock when those
shares are acquired by a party who, by such acquisition, would control at least
one-fifth of all voting rights of the corporations issued and outstanding
stock (and other thresholds thereafter). Florida law provides that the
acquired shares (the control shares) will, upon such acquisition, cease to
have any voting rights unless approved generally by a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding an interested shares.
Interested shares are shares that are owned by the acquiring person, each
officer of the corporation, and each employee of the corporation who also is a
director of the corporation. If such a resolution is approved, and the voting
rights re-assigned to the control shares represent a majority of all voting
rights of the corporations outstanding voting stock, then, unless the
corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, all
shareholders of the corporation shall be able to exercise dissenters rights in
accordance with Florida law. A corporation may, by amendment to its articles
of incorporation or bylaws, provide that, if the party acquiring the control
shares does not submit an acquiring persons statement in accordance with the
statute, the corporation may redeem the control shares at any time during the
period ending 60 days after the acquisition of control shares. If the
acquiring party files an acquiring persons statement, the control shares are
not subject to redemption by the corporation unless the shareholders, acting on
the acquiring partys request, deny full voting rights to the control shares.

     Florida law does not alter the voting rights of any stock of the
corporation acquired in any of the following manners: (a) pursuant to the laws
of the intestate succession or pursuant to a give or testamentary transfer; (b)
pursuant to the satisfaction of a pledge or other security interest created in
good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing the statute; (c) pursuant
to either a merger or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the
agreement or plan of merger or share exchange; (d) pursuant to any savings,
employee stock ownership or other benefit plan of the corporation; or (e)
pursuant to an acquisition of shares that have specifically approved by the
board of directors of the corporation prior to the acquisition. A Florida
corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws prior to any
such acquisition that this statute shall not apply to it.

Affiliated Transactions. 
In general, Florida law prevents an Interested
Shareholder (defined generally as a person with 10% or more of a corporations
outstanding voting stock) from engaging in an Affiliated Transaction with a
corporation for three years following the date such person became and
Interested Shareholder. The term an Affiliated Transaction includes mergers
or consolidation with an Interested Shareholder and certain other transactions
with an Interested Shareholder, including, without limitation: (1) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition to or with the
Interested Shareholder of assets (except proportionately as a stockholder of
the corporation) having an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the
aggregate market value of all assets of the corporation determined on a
consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock
of the corporation; (2) any transaction which results in the issuance or
transfer by the corporation or by certain subsidiaries thereof of any shares of
the corporation or such subsidiary which have an aggregate market value of 5%
percent or more of the aggregate market value of all the outstanding shares of
the corporation to the Interested Shareholder, except pursuant to a transaction
which, in general, effects a pro rata distribution to all shareholders of the
corporation; (3) any transaction involving the corporation or certain
subsidiaries thereof which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of
increasing the proportionate share of the shares of any class or series, or
securities convertible into shares of the corporation or any subsidiary which
is owned directly or indirectly by the Interested Shareholder (except as a
result of immaterial changes due to fractional share adjustments or as a result
of any purchase or redemption of any shares not caused by the
Interested Shareholder); (4) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the
liquidation or dissolution of the corporation proposed by, or pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with the Interested Shareholder or any
affiliate or associate of the Interested Shareholder; or (5) any receipt by the
Interested Shareholder of the benefit (except proportionately as a stockholder
of such corporation) of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other
financial benefits provided by or through the corporation or certain
subsidiaries.

     The three-year moratorium may be avoided if: (1) the affiliated
transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; (2)
the corporation has not had more than 300 shareholders of record at any time
during the 3 years preceding the announcement date; (3) the Interested
Shareholder has been the beneficial owner of at least 80 percent of the
corporations outstanding voting shares for at least 5 years preceding the
announcement date; (4) the Interested Shareholder

- 57 -



is the beneficial owner of at
least 90 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, exclusive
of shares acquired directly from the corporation in a transaction not approved
by a majority of the disinterested directors; (5) the corporation is an
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (6)
certain consideration is paid to the shareholders of the corporation; or (7)
the transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of two
thirds of the voting shares other than the shares beneficially owned by the
Interested Shareholder.

     The Affiliated Transaction restrictions described above do not apply if,
among other things: (1) the corporations original articles of incorporation
contain a provision expressly electing not to be governed by the statute; (2)
the holders of a majority of the voting stock of the corporation approve an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not
to be governed by the statute (effective 18 months after the amendments
adoption), which amendment shall not be applicable to any Affiliated
Transaction with a person who was an Interested Shareholder at or prior to the
time of the amendment; or (3) the corporation adopts and amendment to its
articles of incorporation prior to January 1, 1989, expressly electing not to
be governed by this section provide that such amendment does not apply to any
Affiliated Transaction of the corporation with an Interested Shareholder whose
determination date is on or prior to the effective date of such amendment.

Other Constituency Statute. 
Under Florida law, in discharging their
duties, the directors of a Florida corporation are entitled to consider such
factors as they deem relevant, including, the social, economic, legal, or other
effects of any action on its employees, suppliers, customers of the
corporation, the communities and society in which the corporation operates, and
the economy of the state and nation. The Delaware law does not contain a
similar provision.

Shareholder Action by Written Consent. 
The Delaware law permits
shareholders to act without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote,
if consents in writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the
holders of outstanding stock having the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to authorize such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote with respect to the subject matter thereof were present and voted.

     Unless the articles of incorporation of a Florida corporation provide
otherwise, Florida law authorizes shareholders of the corporation to act
without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if written
consents describing the action taken are executed, dated, and delivered to the
corporate secretary of the corporation by the holders of the corporations
outstanding stock entitled to vote on the matter having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to approve such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the matter were present and
voted.

     Neither Cerner nor Dynamic shareholders may act by written consent.

Amendment of Bylaws. 
Under the Delaware law, the shareholders have the
power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, provided that the corporation may in
its certificate of incorporation confer such authority on the directors as
well. Under the Delaware law, the fact that such power has been conferred on
the directors does not limit the power of the shareholders to adopt, amend or
repeal bylaws.

     Under Florida law, a Florida corporations bylaws may be amended or
repealed by the board of directors or shareholders; provided, however, that the
board may not amend or repeal the corporations bylaws if the articles of
incorporation reserve such power to the shareholders, or the shareholders, in
amending or repealing the bylaws, expressly provide that the board of directors
may not amend or repeal the bylaws or a particular bylaw provision.

Inspection of Books and Records. 
The Delaware law allows any stockowner
to inspect the stockowners list and books of the corporation for a purpose
reasonably related to such persons interest as a shareholder.

     Under Florida law, a shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect
and copy:



the corporations articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended;



resolutions of the board of directors creating different classes or series of stock;



the minutes of all shareholders meetings and actions
taken by written consent of the shareholders for the past 3
years;



written communications to all shareholders generally,
including financial statements, for the past 3 years;

- 58 -





a list containing the names and business street
addresses of the corporations current officers and directors;
and



the corporations most recent annual report delivered
to the Florida Department of State.

     In addition, if a shareholder makes a demand in good faith and for a
proper purpose, the shareholder is entitled to inspect and copy the following
records so long as the records are directly connected with the shareholders
purpose:



all minutes of the board of directors, all minutes of
the shareholders, all actions taken by written consent of the
board of directors and the shareholders, records of any committee
of the board of directors acting on behalf of the corporation;



accounting records of the corporation;



the record of shareholders;



and any other books and records.

Payment of Dividends. 
Under the Delaware law, a corporation generally may
pay dividends out of the corporations surplus or, if the corporation has no
available surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend
is declared or the preceding fiscal year.

     Subject to any restrictions in a corporations articles of incorporation,
Florida law generally provides that a corporation may make distributions to its
shareholders unless after giving effect thereto (1) the corporation would not
be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or
(2) the corporations total assets would be less than the sum of its total
liabilities plus the amount that would be needed upon the dissolution of the
corporation to satisfy the preferential rights of shareholders having superior
preferential rights to those shareholders receiving the distribution.

Certain Differences Between Dynamics and Cerners Charter and Bylaws

Removal of Directors. 
Under the Cerner certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors of Cerner may be removed
from office only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least 80 percent of the then outstanding shares entitled to vote.

     Dynamics bylaws provide that any director or the entire board of
directors may be removed from office with or without cause by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote.

Amendments to Charter. 
Cerners certificate of incorporation requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the then outstanding
shares entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, to amend or repeal
the provisions of Cerners certificate of incorporation regarding: (1) the
number of shares that Cerner is authorized to issue (unless such amendment is
approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, as defined in the
certificate of incorporation); (2) the number of directors and the
classification of the Cerner board, and the filling of vacancies on the Cerner
board, the removal of directors and the process for nominating a candidate for
the Cerner board, and voting power and term of office for directors; (3) the
amendment of Cerners bylaws; (4) the required vote to approve any business
combination; (5) the amendment of Cerners certificate of incorporation; and
(6) the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent or the calling of
special meetings of shareholders.

     Dynamics articles of incorporation are silent with respect to amendment
of its articles of incorporation, therefore Florida law governs. 
See above
Certain Differences Between Florida and Delaware Corporation Statutes 
Shareholder Approval of Certain Corporation Transactions  Amendment of
Charter.

Amendments to Bylaws. 
The Cerner certificate of incorporation provides
that the Cerner board of directors is empowered to make, adopt, alter, amend or
repeal the bylaws and the shareholders may make, adopt, alter, amend or repeal
the bylaws upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of
the shares entitled to vote, voting together as a single class.

     Pursuant to the provisions of Dynamics bylaws, its bylaws may be repealed
or amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of Dynamics full board of
directors or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of the
corporations

- 59 -



outstanding stock entitled to vote. However, Dynamics board of
directors may not amend or repeal any bylaw provision adopted by the
shareholders if the shareholders specifically provide that the bylaw provision
may not be amended or repealed by Dynamics board of directors.

Special Meetings of Shareholders. 
Special meetings of Cerners
shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the Cerner board of
directors, the president of Cerner or the board of directors pursuant to a
resolution approved by a majority of the entire board of directors.

     Special meetings of Dynamics shareholders may be called by Dynamics
president or Dynamics board of directors or when requested in writing by the
holder or holders of not less than ten (10) percent of all of the shares
entitled to vote at the meeting.

Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations. 
Cerners bylaws
permit shareholders entitled to vote to nominate candidates for election to
Cerners board of directors and introduce other business that is a proper
matter for shareholder action in connection with any annual or special meeting
of shareholders with respect to the nomination of a director and in connection
with any annual meeting of shareholders with respect to any other proposed
matter. In either case, the shareholder must provide timely notice to the
secretary of Cerner, and the notice must contain specific information as
further delineated in Cerners bylaws. To be timely, notice must be delivered
to and received by Cerner not less than 120 days prior to the date of the
meeting at which directors are to be elected or the proposed business is to be
conducted or, with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of
shareholders, such notice must be delivered not later than the close of
business on the seventh day following the day on which notice of such meeting
is first given to shareholders.

     Dynamics corporate governance documents have no similar provisions.

Personal Liability of Directors. 
The Cerner certificate of incorporation
limits the personal liability of directors of Cerner for monetary damages
resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware law.

     Dynamics articles of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any
provisions regarding limitation of personal liability of directors for monetary
damages for actions taken as a director. Florida law, however, does provide
that a director of a Florida corporation is not liable for monetary damages for
any statement, vote, decision, or failure to act, regarding corporate
management or policy, unless the director breached or failed to perform his
duties as a director and the directors breach of, or failure to perform, those
duties constitutes a violation of criminal law, self dealing, willful
misconduct, or recklessness.

Business Combination Restrictions. 
Cerner has opted out of the interested
stockholder provisions of Delaware law which prohibit a corporation from
engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder (defined as
a 15 percent stockholder) for a period of three years after the date that
stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met.
Under the Cerner certificate of incorporation, any business combination with
an interested stockholder (as defined in the Cerner certificate of
incorporation) or an affiliate thereof, must be approved by an affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 80 percent of the total outstanding shares of voting
stock, treated as one class, except that such business combination shall
require only the affirmative vote as is required by law if the business
combination has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of
Cerner.

     Neither Dynamics articles of incorporation nor its bylaws contains any
provisions governing transactions with interested stockholders. Florida law
contains a number of provisions which require super majority shareholder
approval for certain affiliate transactions. Under the Florida law, any
merger, consolidation, disposition of all or a substantial part of the assets
of a Florida corporation or a subsidiary of the corporation, or exchange of
securities requiring shareholder approval (a business combination), to which
any person who together with his affiliates and associates beneficially owns 5%
or more of any voting stock of the corporation (an interested stockholder) is
a party, shall be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds
of the voting shares of the corporation other than the shares beneficially
owned by the interested stockholder; 
provided
, that such approval is not
required if:



such transaction has been approved by a majority of the
disinterested directors;



the corporation has not had more than 300 shareholders
of record at any time during the three years preceding the
announcement date;

- 60 -





the interested stockholder has been the beneficial
owner of at least 80% of the corporations outstanding voting
shares for at least five years preceding the announcement date;



the interested stockholder is the beneficial owner of
at least 90% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation,
exclusive of the shares acquired directly from the corporation in
a transaction not approved by a majority of the disinterested
directors;



the corporation is an investment company registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940; or



the consideration to be received by holders of the
stock of the corporation meets certain minimum levels (generally,
the highest price paid by the interested stockholder for any
shares which she or he has acquired).

Shareholder Rights Plan. 
Dynamic does not have a shareholder rights plan.
Cerner does maintain a shareholder rights plan which is designed to (a)
protect shareholders from attempts to acquire control of Cerner without the
approval of Cerners board and (b) prevent abusive tactics from potential
acquirors that do not treat all shareholders fairly. The rights issued
under the plan are not currently exercisable or transferable, and no separate
certificates evidencing such rights will be distributed, unless certain events
occur. The Cerner rights agreement was not intended to prevent a takeover of
Cerner. However, it may cause substantial dilution to certain persons or groups
that beneficially acquire ten percent or more of Cerner common stock unless the
rights issuable under the plan are first redeemed by the Cerner board of
directors. Accordingly, the rights agreement may result in Cerner being less
attractive to a potential acquiror and, in the event that the existence of the
rights issuable under the plan did deter certain potential acquirors, the plan
could result in holders of Cerner common stock receiving less in the event of a
takeover.

DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1999, AND 2000

A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business 
 Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc. (Dynamic or the Company) is a provider of mission-critical
healthcare information systems for clinical services departments and facilities. The Companys product line,
includes a suite of image-, voice-, and web-enabled systems for anatomic pathology, radiology, and laboratory
information management systems. Dynamic is headquartered in the greater Orlando area and has a key operations
and development center near Boston. The Company provides support for all of its systems and offers integration
and other consulting services.

Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable is stated at net book value less an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$360,000, $460,000, and $449,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Bad debt
expense for each of the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000 was $206,805, $242,993, and $378,131
respectively.

Unbilled Receivables / Advance Billings 
 The timing of revenue recognition and contractual billing terms under
certain multiple element arrangements may not precisely coincide resulting in the recording of unbilled
receivables or advance billings. Customer payments are due under these arrangements in varying amounts upon the
achievement of certain contractual milestones throughout the implementation period. Implementation periods
generally range from three to twelve months.

Property and Equipment 
 Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The cost of property and equipment is depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets, ranging from five to ten years, using the straight-line method.

Software Development Costs 
 Costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of computer software
products are research and development costs and are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of producing product
masters subsequent to establishing technological feasibility, including coding and testing, are capitalized.
Capitalization of computer software costs ceases when the product is available for general release to customers.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 were
$1,756,798, $2,077,643, and $1,879,760 respectively. During 2000, the Company wrote off $4,998,234 of
capitalized software costs as a result of a restructuring (See Note I). Accumulated amortization of capitalized
software development costs was $6,586,069, $8,663,712, and $10,543,472 at December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000,
respectively. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using either the straight-line method over
the estimated economic life of the products (initially five years) or the ratio of current revenues to current
and anticipated revenues for the product, whichever results in the greater amount of amortization. Unamortized
capitalized costs of a computer software product in excess of its estimated net realizable value are expensed.

Goodwill 
 Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over a period of seven years. Amortization of goodwill for each of the years ended December
31, 1998, 1999, and 2000 was $407,549. Accumulated goodwill amortization as of December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000
was $1,189,805, $1,597,354, and $2,004,903 respectively. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill
based upon projected operations over a period which represents the approximate remaining life of goodwill. The
Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on this forecast of future cash from operations and
income, and using an undiscounted rate that reflects the Companys average cost of funds. No impairment has been
recorded for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

Revenues 
 Revenues are derived from the sale of computer hardware, licensing and sub-licensing of software,
professional and technical consulting services, and maintenance and support services. Each customer contract is
negotiated separately. Application software licenses, other than software customizations, and computer system
equipment revenues are recorded when they are delivered. Installation and training revenues, which are included
with services and other revenues in the statements of operations, and customized software revenues are recognized

F-8



when the services are performed. Software support revenues principally include contracts for continuing support
services which cover a specific period, and from which revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the
contract. Other service revenues include custom service revenues and post contract support obligations, which
are typically rendered under separate contract and are recognized as the services are performed.

Deferred Revenue 
 Principally results from payments received in advance for software support contracts.

Employee Benefit Plan 
 The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution savings plan covering all full-time
employees. Eligible employees may elect to defer up to 20% of their compensation, but limited to the maximum
allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Company contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors
and amounted to $349,454, $304,998, and $335,898 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The employer match
contribution for 1998, 1999, and 2000 were made through the issuance of 69,608, 64,904, and 89,705 shares of the
Companys common stock, respectively.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans 
 The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, permits entities to recognize as expense
over the vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No.
123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income
and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock compensation as if the fair-value-based method
defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123 for options issued to employees.

Income Taxes 
 Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the recognition of income and
expense for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed
for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets, liabilities and tax carry forwards that
will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future periods based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable
to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax liabilities are
recognized when incurred; deferred tax assets, when necessary, are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that the asset will not be realized.

Earnings Per Share 
 Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
outstanding plus potential common stock which would arise from the exercise of stock options and warrants and
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, if dilutive.

The following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 (see Note M for Reverse Stock Split Subsequent Event):

Cash Equivalents 
 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates relate to the
allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of software development costs and goodwill. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
 The Company generates revenue primarily through sales to entities operating within
the healthcare industry located throughout the United States. Due to this concentration, substantially all
receivables at December 31, 1999 and 2000, are from healthcare institutions which may be similarly affected by
changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses
and such losses have been within managements expectations.

The Company invests its excess cash in deposits with major financial institutions, in U.S. government agency
securities and in commercial paper of companies with strong credit ratings. Generally, the investments mature
within 90 days and, therefore, are subject to little risk. The Company has not experienced losses related to
these investments.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of the Companys financial instruments: The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade
accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts because of the short maturity of those instruments. The fair
value of contract receivables approximates its carrying value, and is estimated by discounting the guaranteed
minimum payments and unguaranteed contract residuals at the imputed incremental borrowing rates of the related
customers (see also Note C herein). The fair value of the bank note payable and line of credit are estimated
based on the current rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities and approximates
its carrying amount.

Segment Information 
 The Company has determined that it operates in a single reporting segment.

Reclassifications 
 Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). FAS 133 requires companies to recognize all derivative
contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value. If certain
conditions are met, a derivative may specifically be designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match
the timing of gain or loss recognition of: (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability
that are attributable to the hedged risk; or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. For a
derivative not designated as a hedging

F-10



instrument, the gain or loss is recognized as income in the period of
change. FAS 133, as amended by FAS 137 and 138, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. Historically, the Company has not entered into any derivative contracts either to hedge
existing risks or for speculative purposes. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the new standard to affect
its financial statements.

In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, and Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. FIN 44 clarifies
the application of Opinion No. 25 for (a) the definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, (b)
the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequences
of various modifications to the previously fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of
stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 was effective July 2, 2000, but certain conclusions
cover specific events that occur after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The adoption of FIN 44 has
not had a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB
No. 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 101 summarizes certain of the SECs views in
applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. In October
2000, the SEC issued additional written guidelines to further supplement SAB No. 101. The adoption of this
bulletin in the fourth quarter 2000 did not significantly impact the Companys financial statements.

The Company leases furniture and fixtures under a capital lease obligation. The capital lease obligation
requires 36 non-cancelable monthly installments of $15,837 which began in October 1998, bears an interest rate of
9.8% and provides for a $100 purchase option to the Company at lease expiration in October 2001.

During the third quarter 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the purchase of $243,687 of
computer and communications equipment. The capital lease requires 36 monthly installments of $7,753 which began

Operating Leases

The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases. The leases call for monthly payments over
terms of 60 to 78 months and include renewal options. Total rent expense on all operating leases was $1,609,000,
$1,445,000, and $1,812,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

Deferred Lease Incentives

In connection with the lease of the Lake Mary office space the Company was provided $1,236,494 of lease
incentives, which are being amortized on a straight line basis over the 78 month lease term beginning September
1, 1998, as a reduction in office rent expense. During 1998, 1999, and 2000, the Company recognized $63,401,
$190,230, and $190,230 of deferred lease incentive against office rent expense.

E. NOTE PAYABLE

Included in other current and non-current liabilities is a note payable (the Note). The Note is payable in
fixed monthly installments of $7,228, bears fixed interest at a rate of 8.74%, and matures on February 1, 2003.
On December 31, 2000 current and long-term portions of the Note were $74,772 and $95,876, respectively.

The Note was issued subject to the terms of the sale of the Companys right to receive minimum payments under a
radiology system contract (the Contract). The Note plus any accrued interest becomes immediately due should
any of the following occur: 1) The Company fails to make a scheduled installment payment. 2) Any default in the
agreement governing the sale of the minimum payments occurs. 3) The customer defaults on the terms of the
Contract. The Note is secured by all the hardware and software included in the Contract plus any payments due to
the Company under the Contract other than the minimum payments sold.

As of December 31, 2000, future maturities pursuant to the Note are as follows:

Year Ended December 31,

170,648

F. LINE OF CREDIT

On March 15, 2001 the Company amended its existing Line of Credit with Silicon Valley Bank (the Bank) which
expires in March, 2002. The amended Line of Credit is intended to provide for up to $3,000,000 of borrowings
based on a maximum advance ratio equal to 75% of qualified receivables. However, the maximum credit limit is
currently $1,500,000 until such time the company is in compliance with the operating budget provided to the Bank,
at which time the maximum credit limit will increase in increments of $500,000 (up to a maximum of $3,000,000)
but will not exceed the Companys tangible net worth. Interest is to accrue at the Banks prime rate plus two
and one half percent, which as of March 15, 2001 was eleven percent (11%), and is due monthly in arrears. The
required tangible net worth covenant was reduced to $1,500,000. The Companys tangible net worth as of December
31, 2000 was $2,687,518. The agreement contains a lock-box requirement and a subjective acceleration clause,
and, therefore, the entire balance is classified as a current liability.

G. SERIES C REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

On July 29, 1998 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Series
C Preferred Stock) together with detachable Warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 100,000 Common Shares of the
Company in a private placement transaction, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $1,814,000. The
Series C Preferred Stock is convertible on a share for share basis to Common Stock, is non-voting, carries a $.16
per share cumulative annual dividend payable calendar quarterly in arrears, has a liquidation preference of $2.00
per share, may be automatically converted upon the Companys Common Stock sustaining sufficient trading at or
above $12.00, and is redeemable by the Company on or after July 29, 2000 at a price of $2.00 per share. The
Warrants are exercisable at $6.75 per Common Share at any time on or before July 29, 2003. On September 29, 1998
common stock underlying the Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants (Securities) was registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and

F-13



2000 all of the then
accrued Series C Preferred Stock dividends aggregating $67,555, $160,000, and $160,000 respectively, were
declared and paid.

H. CAPITAL STOCK, WARRANTS AND OPTIONS

The Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 40,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock and
10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock, in such series and variations in the relative rights and
preferences, including voting rights, if any, between series as the Board of Directors shall determine.

During 1993, the shareholders approved and the Company adopted a stock warrant and option plan for directors and
management employees (the D&M Plan), whereby 83,334 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. During
1997, the shareholders approved increasing shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the D&M Plan to 216,667.
Under the D&M Plan directors and management employee warrants are five year warrants which vest under varying
terms and are issued at an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant. During 1995, the shareholders approved an amendment to the D&M Plan to conform the terms of vesting to
40% upon grant plus 20% per year for each of three years thereafter, and to provide for early vesting upon death
or employment termination without cause for all future options granted under the D&M Plan. Outside directors
receive a five-year warrant for 8,500 shares of the Companys common stock issued the date of their first
election to the Board of Directors. Additionally, annual warrants are issued to certain outside directors at the
beginning of that directors fourth consecutive term in office. Other grants under the D&M Plan are made under
the direction of the Companys Compensation Committee. Each annual warrant is for 1,667 shares of the Companys
Common Stock, has a five year term, has an exercise price equal to the average of the closing bid and ask prices
of the Companys Common Stock on the date of issuance, and is fully vested upon issuance. At December 31, 2000
the Company had stock warrants and options outstanding to purchase shares of its common stock under the D&M Plan

The Company adopted an incentive stock option plan in 1983 for key employees
whereby 133,333 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the
Plan. Options granted vest 40%, 30% and 30% on the first, second and third
anniversaries of their issuance, respectively and expire ten years after the
date of grant. At December 31, 2000, the Company had granted options of
118,347 shares, of which options for 39,913 shares had been exercised, and
78,433 expired unexercised. The 1983 Plan terminated in 2000.

During 1993, the shareholders approved and the Company adopted a new ten year
incentive stock option plan for employees whereby 33,333 shares of common stock
were reserved for issuance under the Plan. The terms of this 1993 ISO Plan are
similar to the 1983 Plan. During 1995 and 1997, the shareholders approved
increasing shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the 1993 ISO Plan to
200,000 then 500,000, respectively. During 2000, the shareholders approved
amending the terms of the 1993 ISO Plan, merging it into and creating a new
2000 Incentive
Stock Option Plan, increasing the shares issuable pursuant to the new Plan to
833,333 shares. At December 31, 2000, the Company had granted options for
992,802 shares, of which 48,683 options had been exercised, 503,327 options
were terminated and options to purchase 161,754 shares were exercisable. Under
both the 1993 and 2000 Plans, the exercise price for stock options may not be
less than the market price of the Companys common stock at date of grant. As
of December 31, 2000 options under the 2000 plan are summarized as follows (see

The Companys Board of Directors, in connection with employment agreements, has
granted employment options. Employment options are exercisable for five years
from the date of grant in accordance with a vesting schedule of 40% upon grant
plus 20% per year for each of three years thereafter at an exercise price equal
to the fair market value on the date of the grant. On August 23, 1994, the
Companys Board of Directors, in connection with an employment agreement,
granted options to Mitchel J. Laskey, the Companys President and then COO,
(now Senior Advisor), for 83,333 shares of common stock under similar terms at
an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant of
$5.0625. On September 13, 1995, the Companys Board of Directors reduced the
exercise price on Mr. Laskeys employment options to $3.00 per share. On
December 17, 1996 the Companys Board of Directors, in connection with various
other employment agreements, granted options covering 32,000 shares of common
stock under similar terms at an exercise price equal to fair market value on
the date of the grant of $15.00. On January 1, 1997 the Companys Board of
Directors granted additional employment options to Mitchel J. Laskey for 16,667
shares of common stock under similar terms at an exercise price of $13.89 which
represents the fair market value on the date of grant. During 1998, 15,833 of
Mitchel J. Laskeys January 1, 1997 options expired. On January 1, 1998 the
Companys Board of Directors approved additional options to Mitchel J. Laskey
for 133,333 shares of common stock, 33,333 shares at an exercise price of
$18.00, $22.50, $27.00 and $31.50 each. All of these employment option
agreements provide for early vesting upon death or employment termination
without cause and were issued at exercise prices no less than the fair market
value of the shares on the date of grant. As such, in accordance with APB 25
no corresponding compensation expense was recognized.

On July 31, 1995 the Company completed a Private Placement Offering issuing
$775,000 of Subordinated Convertible Notes, bearing simple interest at 9% per
annum, together with detachable warrants to purchase 51,666 shares of the
Companys common stock, (debt warrants). The warrants were exercisable at
$3.00 per common share, and are exercisable for five years from the date of
issuance (23,333 in June 1995 and 28,333 in July 1995). During the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 2000, 10,000 and 16,667 of the debt warrants were
exercised, respectively, and 25,000 expired in 2000.

In connection with the Private Placement of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the issuance on
December 8, 1995 of warrants to purchase 70,000 shares of the Companys common
stock for $3.00 per share to a financial consultant (Series B warrants) for
$25,000. These warrants are exercisable for seven years from the date of
issuance. As of December 31, 2000, none of the Series B warrants were
exercised.

During 1998 the employer match contribution of $349,454 to the Companys 401(k)
defined contribution savings plan was made through the issuance of 69,608
shares of the Companys common stock at an average price of $5.01 per share.
During 1999 the employer match contribution of $304,998 to the Companys 401(k)
defined contribution savings plan was made through the issuance of 64,904
shares of the Companys common stock at an average price of $4.71 per share.
During 2000 the employer match contribution of $335,898 to the Companys 401(k)
defined contribution savings plan was made through the issuance of 89,705
shares of the Companys common stock at an average price of $3.75 per share.

On August 8, 2000 the Company issued 49,334 shares of common stock pursuant to
an employment agreement with Mr. Christopher Assif, the Companys CEO, for
$4.92 per share through the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of
$242,720, payable to the Company on or before August 8, 2003. Interest on the
recourse note is payable annually in arrears and accrues at the rate of nine
percent (9%) per annum. This note may be prepaid in whole or
part at any time without penalty. Accrued interest receivable of $8,617 is
included in other assets as of December 31, 2000.

I.     RESTRUCTURING COSTS

During the third quarter of 1999 the Company announced a realignment plan. This
realignment was designed to provide a single focus to the development,
marketing, sales and support of the Companys information systems. It also
established specific cost reductions, revenue improvement and customer
satisfaction objectives and anticipated future cost efficiencies. In
connection with the plan, a total of seventeen employees were terminated.
Termination benefits for the year ended December 31, 1999 are summarized as

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to stop
marketing specific products, and, as a result, recorded restructuring charges
of $5,725,007. In connection with the Companys strategic decision to focus
marketing efforts on the Companys clinical suite of products (CoPathPlus,
RadPlus and e-Premier) and its e-Business initiatives (CoMed Internet).
SurgiPlus and DynamicVision for Imaging will no longer be actively marketed by
the Company. Historical revenues from the discontinued products were
approximately $1,070,857, $2,525,682, and $1,913,858 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 respectively. The abandoned product charges
consist of the write-off of net capitalized software costs of $4,998,234 and a
write-off of prepaid licenses of $130,624. In addition, employee severance and
termination costs, associated with positions eliminated as a result of the
abandoned product offerings, in the amount of $399,735 and a reserve for
contract losses of $196,414 were accrued and expensed during the third quarter
of 2000. A total of 32 employees were terminated in connection with the
abandoned product offerings. Termination benefits paid for the year ended

assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. The tax effects of significant items comprising the
Companys net deferred tax as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, are as follows:

valuation allowance increased $2,700,000 from the allowance of $5,469,000 at
December 31, 1999.

The provisions for Federal income taxes differs from the amount computed by

At December 31, 2000, the Company had unused net operating loss carryforwards
for tax and alternative minimum tax purposes of approximately $20,617,000 and
$19,983,000, respectively, and unused tax credits of approximately $551,000.
These operating loss carryforwards and tax credits expire in varying amounts
during 2007 through 2020.

K.     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company expensed $63,000 and $46,500 during 1998 and 1999, respectively,
for consulting and advisory fees paid to MMRI, Inc. which is majority owned by
the Companys former Chairman of the Board, David Pomerance.

The private placement transaction closing on July 29, 1998, more fully
discussed in Note G, was solely subscribed to by executive officers and
directors of the Company on terms negotiated by non-participating directors and
executive officers with the Companys investment banker.

L.     LITIGATION

On February 27, 2001 the Company signed an Amended Strategic Value Added
Reseller Agreement with Sunquest Information Systems, Inc. Sunquest paid the
Company for maintenance services through December 31, 2003 and advance license
fees, and Sunquest will continue to distribute, implement and support the
Companys CoPath Plus product. This resolves all previous disputes between the
two companies.

As of the date hereof, in the opinion of management, there are no material
legal proceedings pending against the Company which will have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

M.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

(i)  Amendment of Articles of Incorporation:

During 2001, management was notified of a dispute involving the effect on the
conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock (see also Notes G and K) as a
result of the issuance of certain stock options by the Company. The dispute
involved whether or not the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock were
originally intended to exclude from adjustments to the conversion price of the
Series C Preferred Stock, issuances or grants of dilutive securities pursuant
to its employee benefit plans or employment contacts. The Company and its
Series C Preferred Stockholders agreed to resolve this dispute and stipulate
that the exclusion language should have been included in the Amended Articles
of Incorporation from inception and therefore that no adjustment in conversion
price was due to them in exchange for certain other revisions to the terms of
the Series C Preferred Stock. On March 30, 2001, the Company and the holders
of the Series C Preferred Stockholders agreed to amend the Companys Articles
of Incorporation relating to the adjustment of the conversion price of the
Series C Preferred Stock to specifically exempt dilutive securities issued in
connection with employee benefit plans or employment contracts after the
issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, in exchange for creating a Contingent
Dividend provision for the Series C Preferred Stock shareholders. The
Contingent Dividend will be payable only upon conversion or a change of
control, as defined, in an amount equal to the greater of $125,000 or an
accumulated amount calculated beginning January 1, 2001 at the rate of $0.08
per annum per share of Series C Preferred Stock.

(ii)  Reverse Stock Split:

On June 28, 2001, the Company completed a one for three (1:3) reverse stock
split with respect to its common stock. All common share and earnings per
share information, included in the accompanying financial statements, has been
retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split.

N.     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PRO FORMA INFORMATION

F-20



Options granted to the Companys directors and employees under the 1983, 1993
and 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plans, various employment agreements, and the
D&M Stock Option Plan (hereafter, the Plans), are accounted for under APB
Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. The exercise price of each option granted under these Plans
is at least equal to the market price of the Companys stock on the date of
grant. Accordingly, no compensation has been recognized for directors and
employees under these Plans. Had compensation cost for the Plans been
determined based on the fair value of the options at the grant dates consistent
with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), the Companys net earnings (loss) and
net earnings (loss) per share would have reflected the pro forma amounts
indicated below (see Note M for Reverse Stock Split Subsequent Event).

The fair value of each option grant under SFAS 123 is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming no future common
stock dividend declarations. Volatility was computed based on the daily common
stock high, low and close information provided by NASDAQ for the twenty days
prior to the close of trading on the date of each option grant, and range from
59%  234% for options granted during 1998, 116%  331% for options granted
during 1999, and 87%  262% for options granted during 2000. Risk free rates
of 5.0% for options granted with a ten year exercise period and for options
granted with a three to five year exercise period were used for all options
granted during 1998 and 1999. For all options granted during 2000, the risk
free rate used was 4%. The initial forfeiture rate under the 1993 and 2000 ISO
Plans for 1998 was 70%, for 1999 was 44%, and for 2000 was 70%. Under the D&M
Plan, the initial forfeiture rate for 1998 was 70%, and ranged between 0% and
70% for options granted in connection with continuing employment agreements.
The initial forfeiture rate under the D&M Plan for 1999 and 2000 was 35% and
for options granted in connection with employment agreements was 100%. The
weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 1998, 1999,
and 2000 were $1.23, $2.13, and $4.59, respectively.

DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THREE MONTH AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 2001

(UNAUDITED)

(A)  Unaudited Financial Statements:

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by management in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
statements and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all the disclosures required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments and accruals considered necessary for fair
presentation of financial information have been included and are of a normal
recurring nature. Quarterly results of operations are not necessarily
indicative of annual results. These statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Dynamic
Healthcare Technologies, Inc. 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000.

(B)  Note Receivable  Officer:

On August 8, 2000, Mr. Christopher Assif, the Companys then President of
Internet Solutions Products for Dynamic, exercised employment options to
acquire 49,334 common shares for $4.92 per share; on a reverse split adjusted
basis, through the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $242,720
payable to the Company on or before August 8, 2003. Interest on the recourse
note is payable annually in arrears and accrues at the rate of nine percent
(9.0%) per annum.

On June 15, 2001, the Company amended the employment agreement with Mr. Assif,
now the Companys CEO and a member of its board of directors. As part of his
revised employment agreement, Mr. Assif voluntarily reduced his base salary
and management incentive compensation bonus by $150,000 annually. As part of
the consideration for this reduction, the Company amended and restated the
promissory note. The promissory note was amended to convert it from a recourse
to non-recourse note and reduce the rate of interest to six percent (6.0%) per
annum. This note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty
or premium.

As a result of the changes to the terms of the note receivable from a recourse
to a non-recourse note, the underlying options are required to be treated as
variable beginning June 15, 2001, in accordance with Financial Interpretation
No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, any differences between the
exercise price of the options and market price of the Companys common stock is
recorded as compensation expense at each reporting period. There has been no
compensation expense recorded to date for these options as the exercise price
has been above the market price.

(C)  Line of Credit:

As of June 30, 2001, the Company had paid off borrowings against its Line of
Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, and borrowings available under the
Line of Credit were $1,500,000. Interest is to accrue at the Banks prime rate
plus 2.5% which as of June 30, 2001 was 9.25%. Future borrowing capacity is
contingent upon maintaining a monthly tangible net worth of $1,500,000. The
Companys tangible net worth as of June 30, 2001 was $1,959,753.

On July 25, 2001, the Company renegotiated a new Line of Credit Agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank, which expires on July 24, 2002. The new line of credit is
intended to provide for up to $2,500,000 of borrowings based on a maximum
advanced ratio equal to 80% of qualified accounts receivable with a requirement
to maintain a defined Quick Asset Ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. The tangible net worth
requirement was eliminated. Interest is to accrue at a minimum finance rate of
$7,000 a month or the Banks prime rate plus 3.0%, which as of July 31, 2001
was 9.75%, and is due monthly in arrears.

F-26



(D)  Loss Per Share:

Loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average shares
outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted
average shares outstanding plus potential common shares which would arise from
the exercise of stock options, warrants and conversion of the Series C
preferred stock. Diluted loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2001
and 2000 does not include potential common shares, as their effect would be
anti-dilutive. Potential common shares excluded from weighted average shares
due to their anti-dilutive effect include:

(E)  Realignment Costs:

During the second quarter 2001, the Company adopted a formal plan to reallocate
and eliminate selected mid-level management and duplicate staff positions in
the Company. In connection with the plan, a total of thirty-six employees were
terminated and the Company incurred a non-recurring charge in the amount of
$465,204 related to termination and severance benefits. At June 30, 2001,
$363,754 was paid and $101,450 of the remaining accrued severance and
termination benefits will be paid by December 31, 2001. Termination benefits
as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2001 are summarized as follows:

(F)  Reverse Stock Split:

On June 28, 2001, the Company completed a one for three reverse stock split
with respect to its common stock. All common share information, included in
the accompanying financial statements, has been retroactively adjusted to give
effect to the reverse stock split.

F-27



(G)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), and No 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 41 requires the use of the purchase
method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method
of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30,2001. SFAS 141
also requires that the Company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from
goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria. SFAS 141
applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and for
purchase business combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001. It also
requires, upon adoption of SFAS 142 that the Company reclassify the carrying
amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in SFAS 141.

SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that companies no longer amortize
goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In
addition, SFAS 142 requires that the Company identify reporting units for the
purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and reassess the
useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be
tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 is
required to be applied in fiscal years beginning when those assets were
initially recognized. SFAS 142 requires the Company to complete a transitional
goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption. The Company is
also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within
the first interim quarter after adoption of SFAS 142.

The Companys previous business combinations were accounted for using the
purchase method. As of June 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of goodwill is
$644,159. Amortization expense during the six-month period ended June 30, 2001
was $204,777. Currently, the Company is assessing but has not yet determined
how the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will impact its financial position
and results of operations.

Agreement), by and among Cerner Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(Cerner), Cerner Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cerner (Merger Sub), and Dynamic Healthcare Technologies, Inc.,

RECITALS:

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Cerner, DHT and Merger Sub
have determined that the merger of DHT with and into Merger Sub (the Merger),

Common Stock ) (other than (a) Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly,
by Cerner or any Subsidiary of Cerner and (b) Common Stock held in treasury by
DHT) will be converted into the right to receive shares of Cerner Common Stock
as provided herein and each issued and outstanding share of DHT Preferred Stock

. The Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the

the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to a name to be
determined by Cerner.

     (ii)

their respective stockholders:

     (i) 
Common Stock
. With respect to each holder of record of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and subject to Section 2.1(e)(v) relating to fractional shares
(excluding shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(iii)
of this Agreement), the shares of Common Stock held by such
holder shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into
the right to receive that number of shares of Cerner Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of such shares of Common
Stock times the Exchange Ratio (the Merger Consideration).

     (ii) 
Preferred Stock
. With respect to each holder of record
of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall be
redeemed at a price per share of Preferred Stock equal to $2.00 in

     (iii)

respect thereof. Each holder of shares of Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who otherwise would have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Cerner Common Stock (after taking
into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof a cash payment (without interest and
subject to the payment of any 



applicable withholding Taxes) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Cerner Common
Stock multiplied by the Average Cerner Stock Price.

     (f) Stock Options and Other Stock Compensation.

     (i) At the Effective Time, each award, option, warrant or
other right to purchase or acquire Common Stock pursuant to any
warrants, stock awards, stock options or stock appreciation rights
granted under any DHT Employee Plans (as defined in Section
4.13(a) herein) (other than DHTs 401(k) Plan, which will receive
the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(e)(i) of this
Agreement) or otherwise as listed on Section 2.1(f) of the DHT
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the Stock Rights) prior to
the Effective Time and which remains outstanding immediately
after the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease
to represent a right with respect to shares of Common Stock and
shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Cerner
Common Stock, and Cerner shall assume each Stock Right on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Stock Right
(but taking into account any changes thereto (except that there
shall be no acceleration in the vesting or exercisability of such
option, right or incentive compensation by reason of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement other than existing agreements which by their terms
provide for acceleration, which agreements are set forth in
Section 2.1(f) of the DHT Disclosure Schedule indicating the
optionees thereof), provided for in the DHT Employee Plans or in
the terms of such right by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby), with respect to that number of
shares of Cerner Common Stock determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock Right, times the
Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share
of Cerner Common Stock, at (in the case of a stock option or stock
appreciation right) a price per share (rounded to the nearest
one-hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing the per-share
exercise price specified in such stock option or stock
appreciation right, as applicable, by the Exchange Ratio. In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 2.1(f), each Stock Right which is an incentive
stock option under Section 422 of the Code shall be adjusted as
required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension, or renewal of the option, within the meaning of Section
424(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Cerner agrees to take all
necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.1(f)(i).

     (ii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Cerner
shall deliver to the holders of Stock Rights appropriate notices
setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and the grants
pursuant to the DHT Employee Plans shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by
Section 2.1(f)(i) of this Agreement) after giving effect to the
Merger, and Cerner shall comply with the terms of the Stock Rights
and the DHT Employee Plans to ensure, to the extent required by,
and subject to the provisions of, such DHT Employee Plan, that the
Stock Rights which qualified as 



incentive stock options prior to
the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options
after the Effective Time.

     (iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Cerner shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Cerner Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Stock Rights in accordance with this Section
2.1(f). Promptly after the Effective Time, Cerner shall file a
registration statement(s) on Form S-8 with respect to the shares
of Cerner Common Stock subject to such stock options or other
stock related rights or other forms of stock related incentive or
deferred compensation, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such stock options or other stock related rights or other
forms of stock related incentive or deferred compensation remain
outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to
the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Cerner shall
administer the DHT Employee Plans in a manner consistent with the
exemptions provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

     (iv) Prior to the Effective Time, DHT will make any
amendments to the terms of the DHT Employee Plans that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.1(f).

     (g) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Cerner Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock
dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared
with a record date (in the case of a stock dividend) or an effective date
(in the case of a stock split or combination or similar recapitalization
for which a record date is not set) within such period, or any similar
event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration and Exchange Ratio
shall each be proportionately adjusted to prevent any dilutive effect to
the stockholders of DHT which would otherwise result from any such
transaction on a percentage of ownership basis.

Section 2.2. 
Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Cerner and Merger Sub hereby appoint the Exchange Agent to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger. Except as otherwise
provided in this Article II, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each
holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (collectively, the Common
Certificates) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon
surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent, a certificate or certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Cerner Common Stock into which
such holders shares were converted in the Merger pursuant to Section
2.1(e)(i) of this Agreement, and (ii) each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective



Time represented outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock (collectively, the Preferred Certificates) shall be
entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the cash consideration to
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(ii)
of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Cerner will deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, certificates
representing Cerner Common Stock and cash in such amounts necessary to
provide all the Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration required to be exchanged by Cerner pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (such Merger Consideration, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, referred to herein as the
Exchange Fund).

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each record holder of Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Common Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Common Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Common Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Common Certificate evidencing Common Stock, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed, and any other required documents,
the holder of such Common Certificate (other than those shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(iii) of this Agreement) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, certificates representing
shares of Cerner Common Stock as set forth in this Article II, and such
Common Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No holder of a Common
Certificate or Common Certificates shall be entitled to receive any
dividend or other distribution from
Cerner until the surrender of such holders Common Certificate for a
certificate or certificates representing shares of Cerner Common Stock.
Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the holder the amount of any
dividends or other distributions (without interest) that theretofore
became payable with record dates after the Effective Time, but that were
not paid by reason of the foregoing, with respect to the number of whole
shares of Cerner Common Stock represented by the certificates issued upon
surrender, which amount shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Cerner from time to time as such dividends or other distributions are
declared. If delivery of certificates representing shares of Cerner
Common Stock is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Common Certificate surrendered is registered or if any
certificate for shares of Cerner Common Stock as the case may be, is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Common Certificate
surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such
delivery or issuance that the Common Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such delivery or issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of such delivery or issuance to a person
other than the registered holder of the Common Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of Cerner that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.3, each Common Certificate shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive shares of Cerner Common Stock (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares) and the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II without any interest
thereon.



     (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each record holder of Preferred Stock as of the Effective Time, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Preferred Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Preferred Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Preferred Certificates in exchange for Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Preferred
Certificate evidencing Preferred Stock, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed, and any other required documents, the holder
of such Preferred Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, the cash portion of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration,
and such Preferred Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.

     (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of DHT shall be
closed as to holders of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfers of the Common
Stock or the Preferred Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made
or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, (i) Common Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for shares of Cerner Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares) as provided in this Article II, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3, and (ii) Preferred
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in this Article
II, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.

     (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange
Agent which remains undistributed to the former shareholders of DHT for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any shareholders of DHT who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Cerner
Common Stock.

     (f) None of DHT, Cerner, or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or to
any holder of shares of Preferred Stock for the Preferred Merger
Consideration, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

Section 2.3. 
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
to the full extent permitted by law, no certificates representing shares of
Cerner Common Stock shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed an
affiliate of DHT in accordance with Section 7.7 hereof, until such Person has
executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement pursuant to Section 7.7.

with any taxing authority have been filed in substantial compliance with
all applicable laws.

     (b) DHT has timely paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on the
DHT Returns that have been so filed, and as of the time of filing, the
DHT Returns correctly reflected the facts regarding the income, business,
assets, operations, activities and the status of DHT and the DHT

Section 4.13. 
Employee Benefits.

     (a) Section 4.13(a) of the DHT Disclosure Schedule contains a
correct and complete list identifying each material employee benefit
plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), each employment, severance or similar contract,
plan, arrangement or policy and each other plan or arrangement (written
or oral) providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock
option or other stock related rights or other forms of incentive or
deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including
any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, disability
benefits, workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits,
severance benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) that
is maintained, administered or contributed to by DHT or any of its ERISA
Affiliates and covers any employee or former employee of DHT or any DHT
Subsidiary. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable, related trust
agreements) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been furnished, or will be made available upon request, to
Cerner together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including,
if applicable, Schedule B thereto), all summary plan descriptions and
material employee communications prepared in connection with any such
plan. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the DHT
Employee Plans. For purposes of this Section 4.13, ERISA Affiliate of
any Person means any other Person which, together with such Person, would
be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code.

     (b) No DHT Employee Plan is now or at any time has been subject to
Part 3, Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA. At no time
has DHT or any of its ERISA Affiliates contributed to, or been required
to contribute to, any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA (a Multiemployer Plan), or any other plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA (a Retirement Plan), and neither DHT nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has, or ever has had, any liability (contingent or otherwise)
relating to the withdrawal or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer
Plan. To the Knowledge of DHT, no condition exists and no event has
occurred that would be reasonably likely to constitute grounds for
termination of any DHT Employee Plan that is a Retirement Plan or, with
respect to any DHT Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, presents a
material risk of a complete or partial withdrawal under Title IV of ERISA
and neither DHT nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of, or complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered
or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA that would be reasonably
likely to have a DHT Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of DHT,
nothing has been done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding
of any asset under or in connection with any DHT Employee Plan has
occurred that will make DHT or any DHT Subsidiary, or any officer or
director of DHT or any DHT Subsidiary, subject to any liability under
Title I of ERISA or liable for any tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the
Code (assuming the taxable period of any such transaction
expired as of the date hereof) that would be reasonably likely to
have a DHT Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Each DHT Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code now meets, and at all times since its
inception have met, the



requirements for such qualification other than
such requirements for which a remedial amendment period has not expired,
and each trust forming a part thereof is now, and at all times since its
inception has been, exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the
Code. Each such plan has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such plan is qualified and
its related trust is exempt from federal income taxes. DHT has
furnished, or will make available upon request, to Cerner copies of the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect
to each such DHT Employee Plan. Each DHT Employee Plan has been
maintained and administered in substantial compliance with its terms
(except that in any case in which any DHT Employee Plan is currently
required to comply with a provision of ERISA or of the Code, but is not
yet to be amended to reflect such provision, such plan has been
maintained and administered in accordance with the provision) and with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are
applicable to such DHT Employee Plan. All material reports, returns and
similar documents with respect to each DHT Employee Plan required to be
filed with any governmental agency or distributed to any DHT Employee
Plan participant have been duly timely filed and distributed.

     (d) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that, as a
result of the Merger, would be reasonably likely to obligate DHT to make
any payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the
terms of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

     (e) Except as disclosed in writing to Cerner prior to the date
hereof, there has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any DHT Employee Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such DHT Employee Plan
above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000.

     (f) No DHT Employee Plan promises or provides post-retirement
medical, life insurance or other benefits due now or in the future to
current, former or retired employees of DHT or any Subsidiary.

Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and Registrations.

     (a) DHT is not in violation of, nor has DHT has been notified that
it has violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes,
ordinances, regulations, judgments, injunctions, orders or consent
decrees, except for any such

reasonably likely to have a DHT Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) DHT has all permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations of and
registrations with and under all federal, state, local and foreign laws,
and from all Governmental Entities required by DHT to carry on its
business as currently conducted, except where the failure to have any
such permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations or



registrations,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have
a DHT Material Adverse Effect.

     (a) DHT has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all its properties and assets reflected in the DHT

been disposed of in the ordinary course of business and except for
defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar Liens,
encumbrances or impediments that are not reasonably likely to have a DHT
Material Adverse Effect. All such assets and properties, other than
assets and properties in which DHT has leasehold interests, are free and
clear of all Liens, except for Liens are not reasonably likely to have a
DHT Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) DHT (i) is in substantial compliance with the terms of all

conducted by the Surviving Corporation, and (y) make, have made, use,
distribute and sell all products currently sold by DHT and all products

     (b) DHT has not received any notification or other communication of
the existence of any dispute or disagreement with respect to any

Patents, Copyrights, or Trade Secrets (collectively, DHT Intellectual
Property), and to DHTs Knowledge, there are no such threatened disputes
or disagreements.

     (c) All former and current employees of DHT have executed written
contracts with DHT that assign to DHT all rights to any inventions,
improvements, discoveries, or information relating to the business of
DHT. To DHTs Knowledge, no employee of DHT has entered into any contract
that restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in which
the employee
may be engaged or requires the employee to transfer, assign, or
disclose information concerning his work to anyone other than DHT.

     (d) All of the Patents are currently in compliance with formal legal
requirements (including payment of filing, examination, and maintenance
fees and proofs of working or use), are valid and enforceable, and are
not subject to any maintenance fees or taxes or actions except where the
failure to have such ownership or license is not reasonably likely to
have a DHT Material Adverse Effect.



     (e) DHT uses reasonable procedures to keep its Trade Secrets confidential, and DHTs Trade Secrets have been
disclosed only under written agreements that require the recipient to hold such Trade Secrets
confidential.

     (f) No Patent has been or is now involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination, or opposition

Adverse Effect.

Section 6.2. 
Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation.

     (a) DHT agrees that it shall not, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any officer, director,
employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of DHT,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal for DHT, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal for DHT, (iii)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of DHT
equity securities or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal for DHT;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to receipt of the DHT Shareholder Approval, DHTs Board of
Directors reasonably determines in good faith, after receipt of written advice from outside counsel and
independent financial advisor of DHT, that failing to take such action could reasonably be expected to
be a breach of its fiduciary duties to DHTs shareholders under applicable law, DHT may, in response to
an Acquisition Proposal for DHT made after the date of this Agreement which was not solicited by DHT or
its representatives or agents and which did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.2, and
which is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 6.2(c)
(x) furnish information with respect to DHT to any person pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement including customary standstill provisions (as determined by DHT after consultation with its
outside counsel) and (y) participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal for DHT.

     (b) Neither the Board of Directors of DHT nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, or propose publicly
to withdraw, in a manner adverse to Cerner, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or
such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) subject to Section 6.2(d), modify, or propose
publicly to modify, in a manner adverse to Cerner, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal for DHT or (iv) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement or propose publicly
or agree to do any of the foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal for DHT. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time prior to receipt of DHT Shareholder Approval the Board of Directors of



DHT
determines in good faith, after receipt of written opinions from outside counsel and independent
financial advisor of DHT, that it has received an Acquisition Proposal for DHT that constitutes a
Superior Proposal which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2 and that failure to do one of
the following could reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to DHTs shareholders
under applicable Florida Law, the Board of Directors of DHT may (subject to this and the following
sentences) (x) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement,
(y) approve or recommend the Superior Proposal (as defined below), or (z) terminate this Agreement and
concurrently with or after such termination, if it so chooses, cause DHT to enter into any Acquisition
Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, but in each of the cases set forth in clause (x), (y)
or (z), only at a time prior to receipt of the DHT Shareholder Approval and only at a time that is after
the tenth business day following Cerners receipt of written notice advising Cerner that the Board of
Directors of DHT has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal; provided, that in each of
the cases set forth in clause (x), (y) or (z), DHT shall pay to Cerner the fee provided for in Section
9.3(a) of this Agreement prior to the Board of Directors of DHT taking any of the actions described in
such clauses; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors of DHT determines in good faith that
DHTs financial inability to pay the fee provided for in Section 9.3(a) of this Agreement prior to the
Board of Directors of DHT taking any of the actions described in such clauses could reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to DHTs shareholders under applicable Florida
Law, then DHT shall not be required to pay Cerner the fee provided for in Section 9.3(a) prior to taking
the actions described in such clauses, but shall deliver to Cerner prior to taking such actions a
promissory note, in a form reasonably acceptable to Cerner, in the original principal amount of Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00), payable on the earlier of (1) six (6) months after the date of the
promissory note, or (2) the date upon which the transactions contemplated by a Superior Proposal are
consummated. Any such withdrawal or modification of the recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not change the approval of the Board of Directors of DHT
for purposes of causing Section 607.0902 of the Florida Law to be inapplicable to the Merger and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. For all purposes of this Agreement, a Superior
Proposal means any bona fide proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the DHT Securities then outstanding (whether
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other business
combination) or all or substantially all the assets of DHT and otherwise on terms which the Board of
Directors of DHT determines in its good faith judgment (based on a written opinion of DHTs financial
advisor) to be materially more favorable to DHT and its shareholders than the Merger (taking into
account any changes to the financial and other contractual terms of this Agreement proposed by Cerner in
response to such proposal, the Person making the proposal, any legal or regulatory considerations and
all other relevant financial and strategic consideration
s, including the timing of the consummation of
such transactions) and for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
good



faith judgment of the Board of Directors of DHT, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such
third party.

     (c) In addition to the obligations of DHT set forth in Section 6.2(a) of this Agreement, DHT shall
immediately advise Cerner orally and in writing of any request for information or of any Acquisition
Proposal for DHT, the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal for DHT and
the identity of the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal for DHT. DHT will keep Cerner
fully informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or Acquisition Proposal for DHT.

     (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2, and subject to the payment of a termination fee if and to the
extent required by Section 9.3(a), shall prohibit DHT from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to DHTs shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of DHT, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to DHTs shareholders under applicable Law; provided, however, neither DHT nor its Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by Section 6.2(b), withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the Merger or this Agreement or
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal for DHT.

Section 6.3. 
Employment Agreements. DHT agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the
employees of DHT identified in Exhibit F hereto to execute and deliver to Cerner employment agreements in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit G. DHT agrees that it will not terminate the employment of T. Christopher Assif,
John Fingado and Charles R. Johnson, or any of the employees of DHT identified on Exhibit F hereto, without the
prior written consent of Cerner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 6.4. 
401(k) Plans. DHT shall, prior to the Closing Date, adopt any and all resolutions that are
necessary or appropriate to (i) fund all the DHT 401(k) plans, as referenced in Schedule 4.13 (the 401(k)
Plans), with any profit sharing and/or matching contributions that have accrued as of the Closing Date or that
otherwise customarily would have been made by DHT prior to the 401(k) Plans year ends; (ii) require that all
401(k) Plans participant elective deferrals have ceased one pay period prior to Closing such and that all
elective deferrals to be remitted to the 401(k) Plans have been made prior to the Closing Date; (iii) except as
set forth immediately above in (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, cease all other contributions to the 401(k) Plans
as of the day before the Closing Date; (iv) terminate the 401(k) Plans; (v) fully vest all participant account
balances in the 401(k) Plans immediately before the Closing Date; (vi) use all reasonable efforts to complete the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 5310 Application for Determination with respect to the termination of the
401(k) Plans prior to Closing; and (vii) provide for distribution of the assets of the 401(k) Plans following
receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to the termination and distribution of the
assets of the 401(k) Plans.



Section 6.5. 
Incentive Stock Options. The parties agree to work together in good faith to determine the
appropriate treatment of the incentive stock options previously granted to certain DHT employees and DHT agrees
to take agreed upon reasonable actions related to such stock options prior to the Closing Date, including
informing the DHT employees of agreed upon employee communication related thereto.

ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF DHT AND CERNER

     The parties hereto agree that:

Section 7.1. 
Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party will
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the execution hereof.

Section 7.2. 
Certain Filings; Cooperation in Receipt of Consents; Listing.

     (a) Cerner agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC on or before September 27, 2001,
but in not event later than October 17, 2001 (unless consented to by the parties hereto, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld) the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included as Cerners prospectus and shall use its reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger
and the transactions contemplated thereby. DHT shall mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act and, if necessary, after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have
been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if
required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. On or before the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, DHT shall file the Proxy/Prospectus with the SEC. Cerner and DHT shall take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file
a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities or
blue sky laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Cerner Common Stock in the Merger.

     (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by DHT or Cerner without the
approval of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will advise
the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of (i) the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (ii) the issuance of any
stop order, (iii) the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Cerner Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv) any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Registration Statement or Proxy



Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, in each case, whether orally or in writing.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time, DHT or Cerner discovers any information relating to either
party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set forth in an
