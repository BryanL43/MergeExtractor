    stock estimated to be issuable in connection with (a) the offer by the
    registrant through Troy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
    wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, to exchange for each share of
    common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Arguss Communications, Inc.,
    0.3333 shares of Dycom common stock and (b) the merger of Troy Acquisition
    Corp. with and into Arguss Communications, Inc. for the same consideration
    per share of Arguss common stock as is paid in the offer. The maximum
    number, 5,981,639, equals the sum of (1) the product of (a) 14,519,944, the
    total number of shares of Arguss common stock outstanding as of January 22,
    2002, and (b) 0.3333, and (2) the product of (a) 3,426,767, the number of
    outstanding options to purchase shares of Arguss common stock, and (b)
    0.3333.

(2) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) and Rule 457(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended, based on the product of (i) $5.06, the average of the high and low
    sales prices of Arguss Communications, Inc. common stock on January 22,
    2002, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange and (ii) the maximum number
    of shares of Arguss common stock estimated to be received by Dycom or
    cancelled pursuant to the exchange offer and subsequent merger, assuming the
    exercise of all options to purchase Arguss common stock.

(3) Computed in accordance with Rule 457(f) under the Securities Act to be
    $8,355.00 which is equal to 0.000092 multiplied by the proposed maximum
    aggregate offering price of $90,810,358.00.

              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION

Q: WHO IS OFFERING TO EXCHANGE MY SECURITIES?

A: We are Dycom Industries, Inc. We are a leading provider of engineering,
   construction, and maintenance services to telecommunications providers
   throughout the United States. Troy Acquisition Corp., which we refer to as
   Purchaser, is a newly formed Delaware corporation and our wholly owned
   subsidiary. Purchaser has been organized in connection with this offer and
   has not carried on any activities other than in connection with this offer.

Q: WHAT ARE DYCOM AND ARGUSS PROPOSING?

A: We have entered into a merger agreement with Arguss pursuant to which we are
   offering, through Purchaser, to exchange a fractional share of Dycom common
   stock and the associated preferred share purchase right, which we refer to as
   Dycom shares, for each outstanding share of Arguss common stock and the
   associated preferred stock purchase right, which we refer to as Arguss
   shares. After successful completion of the offer and satisfaction of other
   conditions specified in the merger agreement, Purchaser will merge with and
   into Arguss and Arguss will become our wholly owned subsidiary.

Q: WHAT WOULD I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY ARGUSS SHARES?

A: We are offering to exchange 0.3333 Dycom shares for each outstanding Arguss
   share that is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn. After successful
   completion of the offer and satisfaction of other conditions specified in the
   merger agreement, each Arguss share not tendered into the offer will be
   exchanged for 0.3333 Dycom shares in a subsequent merger.

   You will not receive any fractional Dycom shares in the offer or the merger.
   Instead, you will receive cash in an amount equal to the market value of any
   fractional shares that you would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

Q: HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A: The offer is scheduled to expire on Wednesday, February 20, 2002, the initial
   scheduled expiration date. We may decide to extend the offer or, under
   certain circumstances, may be required to extend the offer, if the conditions
   of the offer have not been satisfied by the initial scheduled expiration
   date. We expect to complete the merger shortly after successful completion of
   the offer, or if Arguss stockholder approval is required, shortly after the
   special meeting of the Arguss stockholders to approve the merger.

Q: WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

A: If you are the record owner of your Arguss shares and you tender your shares
   directly to the exchange agent, you will not have to pay brokerage fees or
   incur similar expenses. If you own your shares through a broker or other
   nominee, and your broker tenders the shares on your behalf, your broker may
   charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to
   determine whether any charges will apply.

Q: WHAT DOES ARGUSS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

A: Arguss' board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the
   transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, are
   fair to and in the best interests of Arguss and Arguss stockholders, has
   approved, adopted and declared the advisability of the merger agreement and
   the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger,
   and recommends that Arguss stockholders accept the offer and tender their
   shares pursuant to the offer. Information about the recommendation of Arguss'
   board of directors is more fully set forth under "Reasons for the Arguss
   Board's Recommendation; Factors Considered" beginning on page 25 and in
   Arguss' Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is
   being mailed to Arguss stockholders together with this prospectus.

Q: HAVE ANY ARGUSS STOCKHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

A: Yes. The current directors and certain executive officers of Arguss have
   agreed to tender

   into the offer all of their Arguss shares, representing approximately 6.7% of
   the outstanding Arguss shares as of January 22, 2002 (or 5.4% on a
   fully-diluted basis).

Q: HAS ARGUSS RECEIVED A FAIRNESS OPINION IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER AND THE
   MERGER?

A: Yes. Arguss has received an opinion from its financial advisor, Allen &
   Company Incorporated, to the effect that, as of January 7, 2002, based upon
   and subject to various considerations set forth in its opinion, the
   consideration to be received by holders of Arguss shares pursuant to the
   merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
   You should read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. The opinion does
   not constitute a recommendation as to whether or not Arguss stockholders
   should tender shares pursuant to the offer.

Q: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF DYCOM'S SHARES WILL ARGUSS STOCKHOLDERS OWN AFTER THE
   OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A: After completion of the merger, former stockholders of Arguss would own
   approximately 10% of the outstanding Dycom shares, based on the number of
   outstanding Dycom shares and Arguss shares on January 22, 2002 and not taking
   into account unexercised stock options.

Q: WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

A: We are not obligated to exchange any Arguss shares unless, among other
   things:

   - a majority of the outstanding Arguss shares, on a fully-diluted basis, are
     validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, which we refer to as the
     minimum tender condition,

   - all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws have expired or have
     been terminated,

   - the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, has been
     declared effective by the SEC,

   - Arguss has not breached any obligation, covenant or agreement in a material
     manner,

   - Arguss' representations and warranties are true or, if any are not true,
     they are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, result
     in a material adverse effect on Arguss,

   - the Arguss forbearance agreement with certain banks is amended to extend
     the forbearance period until the effective time of the merger, and

   - the Dycom shares to be issued in the offer and the merger have been
     approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject only to
     official notice of issuance.

   These conditions and other conditions to the offer are discussed in this
   prospectus under "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page 39.

Q: HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

A: You will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
   Wednesday, February 20, 2002, to decide whether to tender your shares in the
   offer. If you cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a
   valid tender by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery
   procedure which is described under "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering"
   beginning on page 33.

Q: CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

A: We may, without the consent of Arguss, but subject to the terms of the merger
   agreement and applicable law, extend the period of time during which the
   offer remains open. We have agreed in the merger agreement that we will
   extend the offer for a period of not more than 15 business days if the
   minimum tender condition has not been satisfied at the initial scheduled
   expiration date. In addition, we may, although we do not currently intend to,
   extend the offer for a subsequent offering period of not less than three
   business days nor more than 20 business days. You will have withdrawal rights
   during any extension period but not during any subsequent offering period.
   See "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and Amendment" beginning on page 30.

Q: HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

A: If we decide or are required to extend the offer, or if we decide to provide
   for a subsequent offering period, we will inform the exchange agent of that
   fact and we will make a public announcement of the results of the exchange
   offer, and give the new expiration date no later than 9:00 a.m., New York
   City time, on the day after the day on which the offer was previously
   scheduled to expire. See "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and Amendment"
   beginning on page 30.

Q: HOW DO I ACCEPT THE OFFER?

A: To tender your shares, you should do the following:

   - if you hold Arguss shares in your own name, complete and sign the enclosed
     letter of transmittal and return it with your share certificates to First
     Union National Bank, the exchange agent for the offer, at the appropriate
     address specified on the back cover page of this prospectus before the
     expiration date of the offer,

   - if you hold your Arguss shares in "street name" through a broker, instruct
     your broker to tender your shares before the expiration date, or

   - if your Arguss share certificates are not immediately available or if you
     cannot deliver your Arguss share certificates and other documents to the
     exchange agent prior to the expiration of the offer, or you cannot complete
     the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, you
     may still tender your Arguss shares if you comply with the guaranteed
     delivery procedures described under "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering"
     beginning on page 33.

Q: UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

A: You may withdraw previously tendered Arguss shares any time prior to the
   expiration of the offer, and, unless we have accepted the shares pursuant to
   the offer, you may also withdraw any tendered shares at any time after March
   23, 2002. Any Arguss shares tendered during the subsequent offering period
   may not be withdrawn. Also, once we have accepted shares for exchange
   pursuant to the offer, all tenders become irrevocable. See "The Offer --
   Withdrawal Rights" on page 33.

Q: HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

A: To withdraw previously tendered Arguss shares, you must deliver a written or
   facsimile notice of withdrawal with the required information to the exchange
   agent while you still have the right to withdraw. If you tendered shares by
   giving instructions to a broker or bank, you must instruct the broker or bank
   to arrange for the withdrawal of your shares. See "The Offer -- Withdrawal
   Rights" on page 33.

Q: WILL I BE TAXED ON THE DYCOM SHARES THAT I RECEIVE?

A: Assuming that the merger is completed, an Arguss stockholder's receipt of
   Dycom shares in the offer or the merger will be tax free for United States
   federal income tax purposes (except for taxes resulting from the receipt of
   cash instead of any fraction of a Dycom share).

   You are urged to carefully read the discussion under "The Offer -- Material
   United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 36, and to
   consult your tax advisor on the consequences of participation in the offer or
   the merger.

Q: IS DYCOM'S FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER MY SHARES IN
   THE OFFER?

A: Yes. Arguss shares accepted in the offer will be exchanged for Dycom shares
   and you should therefore consider our financial condition before you decide
   to become one of our shareholders through the offer. In considering Dycom's
   financial condition, you should review the documents incorporated by
   reference in this prospectus because they contain detailed business,
   financial and other information about us. See "Where You Can Find More
   Information About Dycom and Arguss" beginning on page 5.

Q: IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

A: If you decide not to tender your Arguss shares in the offer and the merger
   occurs, you will receive in the merger the same number of Dycom shares for
   each Arguss share you own that you would have received had you tendered your
   Arguss shares in the offer. In connection with the merger, Arguss
   stockholders may have a right to dissent and demand appraisal of their Arguss
   shares.

Q: WILL ARGUSS CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

A: If the merger occurs, Arguss will no longer be publicly owned. Even if the
   merger does not occur, if we purchase all the Arguss shares tendered there
   may be so few remaining Arguss stockholders and publicly held Arguss shares
   that Arguss shares may no longer be eligible to be traded on the New York
   Stock Exchange or other securities markets, there may not be a public trading
   market for the Arguss shares or Arguss may cease making filings with the SEC
   or otherwise cease to be required to comply with SEC rules relating to
   publicly held companies.

Q: DO THE STATEMENTS ON THE COVER PAGE REGARDING THIS PROSPECTUS BEING SUBJECT
   TO CHANGE AND THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SEC NOT YET BEING
   EFFECTIVE MEAN THAT THE OFFER HAS NOT COMMENCED?

A: No. The offer has commenced and change of this prospectus and effectiveness
   of the registration statement are not necessary for you to tender your Arguss
   shares. The SEC rules permit exchange offers to begin before the related
   registration statement has become effective, and we are relying on these
   rules, with the goal of quickly combining Dycom and Arguss, subject to the
   SEC declaring the registration statement effective.

Q: WHERE CAN I FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DYCOM AND ARGUSS?

A: You can find out more information about Dycom and Arguss from various sources
   described under "Where You Can Find More Information About Dycom and Arguss"
   beginning on page 5.

"Where You Can Find More Information About Dycom and Arguss" beginning on page

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGES 30 AND 52)

     We are proposing to acquire Arguss. We are offering to exchange 0.3333
Dycom shares for each outstanding Arguss share that is validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn.

     We intend, promptly after completion of the offer, to seek to merge
Purchaser, our wholly owned subsidiary and the purchaser in the offer, with and
into Arguss. As a result, Arguss will become our wholly owned subsidiary. Each
Arguss share that has not been exchanged or accepted for exchange in the offer
would be converted in the merger into the same number of Dycom shares as is paid
per Arguss share in the offer. Dycom seeks to acquire ownership of 100% of
Arguss' shares through the offer and the merger.

     The board of directors of Arguss has determined that the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger,
are fair to and in the best interests of, Arguss and Arguss stockholders, has
approved, adopted and declared the advisability of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, and
recommends that Arguss stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares
pursuant to the offer.

THE OFFER (PAGE 30)

  Summary of the Offer

     We are offering, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this prospectus and in the related letter of transmittal, to exchange Dycom
shares for Arguss shares at an exchange ratio of 0.3333 Dycom shares for each
outstanding Arguss share that is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on
or prior to the expiration date of the offer or during any subsequent offering
period.

     The term "expiration date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Wednesday, February 20, 2002 unless we extend the period of time during which
this offer is open, in which case the term "expiration date" means the latest
time and date on which the offer, as so extended, expires.

     We are making this offer in order to acquire control of, and ultimately all
outstanding equity securities of, Arguss. We intend, as soon as possible after
consummation of the offer, to seek to have Arguss and Purchaser consummate the
merger. At the effective time of the merger, each Arguss share, except for
treasury shares and shares held by Dycom, Purchaser or any of Dycom's or
Purchaser's subsidiaries and shares in respect of which appraisal rights, if
available, have been properly perfected, will be converted into the right to
receive the same number of Dycom shares as is paid per Arguss share in the
offer.

  Conditions to the Offer

     Our obligation to exchange Dycom shares for Arguss shares is subject to
several conditions referred to under "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer"
beginning on page 39, including conditions that require the tender of at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding Arguss shares on a fully diluted
basis, which we refer to as the minimum tender condition, and receipt of all
required regulatory approvals.

  Timing of the Offer

     Our offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City
time, on Wednesday, February 20, 2002. However, we may extend our offer from
time to time as necessary until all the conditions to the offer have been
satisfied. See "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and Amendment" beginning on
page 30.

  Extension, Termination and Amendment

     We expressly reserve the right, in our sole discretion (subject to the
provisions of the merger agreement), at any time or from time to time, to extend
the period of time during which our offer remains open (a) beyond the initial
scheduled expiration date or extension of the offer if, at the scheduled or
extended expiration date of the offer, any of the conditions to the offer have
not been satisfied or waived, until the conditions to the offer are satisfied or
waived, (b) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC applicable to the offer or (c) for an aggregate period of
not more than ten business days beyond the latest applicable date that would
otherwise be permitted under clause (a) or (b) above, if, as of the expiration
date, all of the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived but the
number of Arguss shares validly tendered and not withdrawn equals more than 50%,
but less than 90%, of the outstanding Arguss shares on a fully diluted basis. We
have agreed, pursuant to the merger agreement, to extend the offer if the
minimum tender condition is not met for up to 15 business days after the initial
scheduled expiration date.

     We can extend our offer by giving oral or written notice of extension to
the exchange agent. If we decide to extend our offer, we will make an
announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. During any
such extension, all Arguss shares previously tendered and not properly withdrawn
will remain tendered, subject

to your right to withdraw your Arguss shares. An extension of the offer is
different than a subsequent offering period. The consequences of a subsequent
offering period are described below.

     Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations and the terms of the
merger agreement, we also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, at any time
or from time to time, to (1) delay our acceptance for exchange or the exchange
of any Arguss shares pursuant to our offer, regardless of whether we previously
accepted Arguss shares for exchange, or to terminate our offer and not accept
for exchange or exchange any Arguss shares not previously accepted for exchange
or exchanged, upon the failure of any of the conditions of the offer to be
satisfied and (2) waive any of the conditions to the offer and to make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the offer provided that we will not (a)
make any change in the form of consideration to be paid in the offer, (b)
decrease the consideration payable in the offer, (c) reduce the maximum number
of Arguss shares to be purchased in the offer, (d) impose conditions to the
offer in addition to those set forth in the merger agreement, or (e) make any
other change that is adverse to the stockholders of Arguss. We will give oral or
written notice of any such delay, termination or amendment to the exchange agent
and by making a public announcement.

     We will follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay, as promptly
as practicable, with a public announcement. In the case of an extension, any
such announcement will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to
applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require that any material change in the
information published, sent or given to Arguss stockholders in connection with
the offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to
inform stockholders of such change) and without limiting the manner in which we
may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish,
advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by
making a release to the Dow Jones News Service or the PR Newswire Association,
Inc.

  Exchange of Shares

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or
amendment), we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, Arguss shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as promptly as practicable after the
expiration date and promptly after they are tendered during any subsequent
offering period.

  Withdrawal Rights

     Arguss shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time
prior to the expiration date, and, unless we previously accepted them pursuant
to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after Saturday, March 23, 2002.
Once we have accepted shares for exchange pursuant to the offer, all tenders not
previously withdrawn become irrevocable.

     You will not have the right to withdraw Arguss shares tendered in any
subsequent offering period.

  Subsequent Offering Period

     We may, although we do not currently intend to, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period of three to 20 business days after the acceptance of
Arguss shares pursuant to the offer if the requirements under Rule 14d-11 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have been met. You will not have the right to
withdraw Arguss shares that you tender during a subsequent offering period. If
we elect to provide a subsequent offering period, we will make a public
announcement of the results of the exchange offer, including the approximate
number and percentage of Arguss shares deposited, no later than 9:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the next business day after the expiration date of the
initial offering period and immediately begin the subsequent offering period.

  Procedure for Tendering Arguss Shares

     For you to validly tender Arguss shares pursuant to our offer, you must
either:

     - properly complete a duly executed letter of transmittal (or manually
       executed facsimile of that document), along with any required signature
       guarantees, or an agent's message, which is explained below, in
       connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents,
       and the transmittal letter must be transmitted to and received by First
       Union National Bank, the exchange agent for the offer, at one of its
       addresses set forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and
       certificates for tendered Arguss shares must be received by the exchange
       agent at such address, or those Arguss shares must be tendered pursuant
       to the procedures for book-entry tender set forth in "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering" beginning on page 33 (and a
       confirmation of receipt of such tender received), in each case before the
       expiration date, or

     - comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering" beginning on page 33.

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER (PAGE 38)

     If at the end of the offer we have received 90% or more of the outstanding
Arguss shares, we will effect a short-form merger as permitted under Delaware
law, which does not require notice to or approval by Arguss stockholders. If,
however, at the end of the offer we have received more than the majority, but
less than 90%, of the outstanding Arguss shares, we will effect a long-form
merger as permitted under Delaware law. A long-form merger would require notice
to and approval by Arguss stockholders and would take considerably longer to
complete.

     Dycom's shareholders do not have to, and will not, vote on the approval of
the merger.

THE STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT (PAGE 61)

     Concurrently with entering into the merger agreement, the current directors
and certain executive officers of Arguss entered into a stockholders' agreement
pursuant to which such persons have agreed, among other things, to validly
tender (and not withdraw) their Arguss shares into the offer, and to vote their
Arguss shares in favor of the merger, if applicable. On January 22, 2002, these
persons owned (either beneficially or of record) 972,839 Arguss shares,
constituting approximately 6.7% of the outstanding Arguss shares (or
approximately 5.4% on a fully diluted basis). For a more detailed description of
the terms and conditions of the stockholders' agreement, see "The Stockholders'
Agreement" beginning on page 61.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 38)

     The offer does not entitle you to appraisal rights. However, the merger may
entitle you to appraisal rights with respect to your Arguss shares. See "The
Offer -- Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 38.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 36)

     The offer and merger have been structured so as to qualify as a "tax-free
reorganization" for United States federal income tax purposes. Accordingly,
assuming that the merger is completed, holders of Arguss shares generally will
not recognize any gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes on
the exchange of their Arguss shares for Dycom shares in the offer and merger,
except for any gain or loss recognized in connection with any cash received
instead of a fractional Dycom share. The companies themselves, as well as
current holders of Dycom shares, will not recognize gain or loss as a result of
the offer and the merger.

     THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT
APPLY TO ALL HOLDERS OF ARGUSS SHARES, INCLUDING CERTAIN HOLDERS SPECIFICALLY
REFERRED TO ON PAGE 36. YOUR UNITED STATES FEDERAL

INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES WILL DEPEND ON YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD
CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
OFFER AND THE MERGER TO YOU.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO ARGUSS (PAGE 44)

     Allen & Company has delivered to the Arguss board its written opinion,
dated January 7, 2002, to the effect that, as of that date, based upon and
subject to various considerations and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the
consideration to be received by the Arguss stockholders pursuant to each of the
offer and the merger is fair to the stockholders from a financial point of view.
The full text of the opinion of Allen & Company, which outlines the assumptions
made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken with respect
to its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this prospectus and is incorporated by
reference herein. ARGUSS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD, READ THE OPINION
IN ITS ENTIRETY. See "The Offer -- Opinion of Financial Advisor to Arguss"
beginning on page 44.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE TRANSACTIONS (PAGE 63)

     Some directors and executive officers of Arguss may have interests in the
offer and the merger that are different from or in addition to your interests.
As a result of the offer, options that certain of these directors and executive
officers hold will accelerate and become exercisable on the acceptance date of
the offer. Also, the Arguss executive officers have employment agreements which
may entitle them to various payments upon a change of control of Arguss. The
consummation of the offer would constitute such a change of control under these
agreements. As a result, certain Arguss directors and executive officers may
have interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to,
your interests. See "Interests of Certain Persons" beginning on page 63.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS (PAGE 76)

     Your right to receive Dycom shares in exchange for your Arguss shares may
result in differences between your rights as an Arguss stockholder, governed by
Delaware law and Arguss' organizational documents, and your rights as a Dycom
shareholder, governed by Florida law and Dycom's organizational documents.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (PAGE 50)

     Dycom will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting
purposes.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In deciding whether to tender your Arguss shares pursuant to the offer, you
should carefully read this prospectus, the accompanying Schedule 14D-9 of Arguss
and the other documents to which we refer you. You should also carefully
consider the following risk factors relating to the offer and the merger and
with respect to ownership of Dycom shares.

RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     DYCOM SHARES TO BE RECEIVED BY ARGUSS STOCKHOLDERS IN THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE IN VALUE

     The market price of the shares of our common stock to be issued in the
offer and the merger may change as a result of changes in our or Arguss'
business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the impact of the offer
and the merger or general market conditions. Although our business is similar to
that of Arguss, our results of operations, as well as the market price of our
common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting Arguss'
results of operations and the market price of Arguss shares. As the market price
of our common stock fluctuates, the value of the Dycom shares to be received by
Arguss stockholders in the offer or the merger will depend upon the market price
of Dycom shares at the time they are received pursuant to the offer or the
merger. There can be no assurance as to this value. In addition, because the
fraction of a Dycom share being offered for each Arguss share is fixed, the
amount by which the value of the consideration that you actually receive in the
offer or the merger could decline is not limited.

     BENEFITS OF THE COMBINATION MAY NOT BE REALIZED

     If we complete the merger, we will integrate two companies that have
previously operated independently. Integrating our operations and personnel with
those of Arguss will be a complex process. We may not be able to integrate the
operations of Arguss with our operations rapidly or without encountering
difficulties. The successful integration of Dycom with Arguss will require,
among other things, integration of Arguss' and Dycom's network service
offerings, sales and marketing operations, information and software systems,
coordination of employee retention, hiring and training operations, and
coordination of future research and development efforts. The diversion of
management's attention to the integration effort and any difficulties
encountered in combining operations could adversely affect the combined
company's businesses. Further, the process of combining Dycom and Arguss could
negatively affect employee morale and the ability of Dycom to retain some of
Arguss' key personnel after the merger. Also, we could face additional risks
inherent in Arguss' business that we were not previously subject to. For
example, the additional requirements that we may have in the future to fund our
operations could be significantly increased due to the capital requirements of
Arguss' business.

     OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF ARGUSS HAVE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     Arguss stockholders should be aware of potential conflicts of interest and
the benefits available to Arguss officers and directors when considering Arguss'
board of directors' adoption and approval of the merger agreement and its
recommendation to Arguss stockholders to tender their Arguss shares in the
offer. For example, Arguss' Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
and its two other executive officers have unvested and otherwise unexercisable
stock options that will vest upon the completion of the offer and become options
to acquire Dycom shares. The executive officers of Arguss have employment
agreements that provide for significant cash payments and a continuation of
health and related benefits upon a change of control of Arguss, which will occur
as a result of the offer. The merger agreement also provides for continuing
indemnification of officers and directors of Arguss after the effective date of
the merger. In addition, the current directors and certain executive officers of
Arguss have entered into a stockholders' agreement with Dycom that, among other
things, requires these directors and executive officers to tender their Arguss
shares in the offer and support the offer and the merger. Arguss' officers and
directors are also indemnified by Arguss with respect to some of their actions.
As a result, Arguss officers and directors may have interests in the transaction
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Arguss
stockholders. See "Interests of Certain Persons" beginning on page 63.

     THE RECEIPT OF DYCOM SHARES COULD BE TAXABLE TO YOU, DEPENDING ON FACTS
SURROUNDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     We and Arguss have structured the offer and the merger so as to qualify as
a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. We
believe that the offer and the merger will be treated for United States federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if the minimum
tender condition for the offer is satisfied, and the merger is completed
promptly after the offer, in accordance with the current terms of the merger
agreement and applicable state law. However, the ability to satisfy these
factual conditions, and therefore the United States federal income tax
consequences of the offer and the merger, depends in part on facts that will not
be known before the completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the
merger will be completed, or that these factual conditions will be satisfied.

     If these factual conditions are not satisfied, your exchange of Arguss
shares for Dycom shares in the offer or the merger could be a taxable
transaction, depending on surrounding facts. You are urged to carefully read the
discussion under "The Offer -- Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences" beginning on page 36, and to consult your tax advisor on the
consequences of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

     THE ACCEPTANCE OF ARGUSS SHARES IN THE OFFER MAY REDUCE THEIR LIQUIDITY AND
MARKET VALUE, MAY RESULT IN THEIR DELISTING FROM THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AND
MAY CAUSE THE SHARES TO LOSE THEIR STATUS AS "MARGIN SECURITIES"

     The acceptance of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the
number of holders of Arguss shares that might otherwise trade publicly, and may
therefore reduce the liquidity and market value of the remaining Arguss shares
held by the public. Depending on the number of Arguss shares acquired pursuant
to the offer, Arguss shares may no longer meet the requirements of the New York
Stock Exchange for continued listing. Should that occur, it is possible that
Arguss shares would be traded on other securities exchanges or in the
over-the-counter market, and that price quotations would be reported by those
other exchanges, or through the NASDAQ National Market or by other sources. The
Arguss shares may also no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes
of the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the Arguss
shares would be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

RISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF DYCOM SHARES

     The following risks are risks that you may be exposed to as a Dycom
shareholder.

     OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY

     We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, quarterly
variations in revenues and net income as a result of many factors, including:

     - the timing and volume of customers' construction and maintenance
       projects,

     - budgetary spending patterns of customers,

     - the commencement or termination of master service agreements and
       long-term agreements,

     - costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions,

     - fluctuations in operating results caused by acquisitions,

     - changes in our mix of customers, contracts and business activities, and

     - fluctuations in insurance expense accruals due to changes in claims
       experience and actuarial assumptions.

     In addition, revenues and net income in our second quarter and,
occasionally, in our third quarter have in the past been, and may in the future
be, adversely affected by weather conditions and year-end budgetary spending
patterns of our customers.

     WE DEPEND ON A SMALL GROUP OF KEY CUSTOMERS

     Our customer base is highly concentrated. Our top five customers in fiscal
1999, 2000 and 2001 and for the quarter ended October 27, 2001 accounted in the
aggregate for approximately 60%, 53%, 52% and 50%, respectively, of our total
contract revenues. During fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 and for the quarter ended
October 27, 2001 approximately 23%, 17%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our total
contract revenues were derived from BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.; 15%, 9%,
16% and 18%, respectively, from Comcast Cable Communications, Inc.; and 10%,
13%, 4% and 4%, respectively, from AT&T Broadband, Inc. Qwest Communications
International, Inc., also a top customer in fiscal 2001 and for the quarter
ended October 27, 2001, accounted for approximately 7% of our total contract
revenues for each of those time periods. We believe that a substantial portion
of our contract revenues and operating income will continue to be derived from a
concentrated group of key customers. The loss of any one key customer, if not
replaced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

     OUR MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED OR MAY NOT BE RENEWED

     We derive a substantial portion of our revenues pursuant to multi-year
master service agreements. We are currently a party to 75 master service
agreements, which include agreements with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.,
Verizon, Sprint Corporation and Qwest. Under the terms of these agreements, our
customers can typically terminate the agreement on 90 days' prior written
notice. The termination of any such agreements or our failure to renew master
service agreements with our customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     OUR CUSTOMERS' FUTURE REQUIREMENTS MAY BE LESS THAN OUR BACKLOG ESTIMATE

     Our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be
performed under job-specific agreements and the estimated value of future
services that we expect to provide our customers under master service
agreements. Our master service agreements are generally exclusive requirements
contracts with certain exceptions, including the customer's option to perform
the services with its own regularly employed personnel. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance as to our customers' requirements during a particular period or
that our estimates of such requirements, including those used to formulate
backlog, are accurate at any point in time.

     WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY

     As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand,
complement or diversify our business. We regularly review various strategic
acquisition opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding such
possible acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify
attractive acquisition candidates, enter into acceptable acquisition agreements
or close any such transactions. Other than with respect to the acquisition of
Arguss, we are not party to any agreements, understandings or arrangements
regarding any material acquisitions. Failure to achieve our acquisition strategy
could materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain growth and maintain
our competitive position. In addition, increased competition for acquisition
candidates could increase the cost of making acquisitions and reduce the number
of attractive companies to be acquired. Although we maintain a decentralized
operations structure, we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired
companies or their management teams. We may also encounter difficulties in
retaining key personnel or customers. These difficulties could increase the cost
of any acquisition or reduce or eliminate any expected benefit. In addition,
acquisitions may have adverse effects on our results of operations caused by the
amortization of acquired intangible assets or unanticipated liabilities or
contingencies.

     We may be required to incur debt or issue equity to pay for any future
acquisitions, and these sources of financing may not be available to us on
favorable terms or at all. In addition, if we use common stock to pay for future
acquisitions, the value of any Dycom shares you own may become diluted. If we
cannot

use common stock or borrow sufficient funds to pay for future acquisitions, our
growth strategy could be limited.

     WE ARE SELF-INSURED AGAINST POTENTIAL LIABILITIES

     We are primarily self-insured, up to a limited amount, for automobile,
general liability, workers' compensation and employee group health claims. A
liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not
reported losses, is actuarially determined and reflected in our consolidated
balance sheet as an accrued liability. The determination of such claims and
expenses and the extent of the accrued liability are continually reviewed and
updated. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates
and were unable to offset such increases with earnings, our business could be
materially and adversely affected.

     WE ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY PERSONNEL

     We are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our
senior management team, including Steven E. Nielsen, our President and Chief
Executive Officer, and one or more managers of key operating subsidiaries. Any
loss of the services of these individuals or other members of our senior
management could have a material adverse effect on our business.

     FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE

     Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public
market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect
the market price of our common stock. As of January 22, 2002, we had outstanding
42,926,666 shares of common stock, plus 2,293,088 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options, including 694,167
options that are currently exercisable. Of the outstanding shares, approximately
41,618,442 are freely tradable in the public market. The remaining 1,308,224
shares are "restricted securities" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933. These shares were issued in connection with various
acquisitions in fiscal 2000 and 2001. Restricted shares may be sold in the
public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from
registration under Rules 144, 144(k) or 701 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933. Of the 1,308,224 restricted shares, 871,208 shares are currently
eligible for resale pursuant to a transaction complying with Rule 144 and the
remaining shares will become eligible for resale during April 2002 pursuant to a
transaction complying with Rule 144.

     OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE

     The market price for our common stock has been, and may continue to be,
highly volatile. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price
of our common stock. Such factors include:

     - announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating
       results of one of our competitors,

     - announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our
       competitors,

     - market conditions for telecommunications or telecommunications services
       company stocks in general,

     - changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts,
       and

     - announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.

     In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations in recent years that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely
affect the market price of our common stock.

     ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY INHIBIT CHANGES OF CONTROL

     Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions which may
deter, discourage or make more difficult a takeover or change of control of
Dycom by another corporation. These anti-takeover provisions include:

     - the authority of our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares
       of preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms and with
       such rights as our board of directors may determine, and

     - the requirement of a classified board of directors serving staggered
       three-year terms.

     We have also adopted a shareholder rights plan and have executed change of
control agreements with key officers, which may make it more difficult to effect
a change in control of Dycom and replace incumbent management. Lastly, we are
subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation
Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change of
control even if such change of control would be beneficial to shareholders and
could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

                             DYCOM INDUSTRIES, INC.

                SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     The following table sets forth certain selected financial data of Dycom as
of and for the years ended July 28, 2001, July 29, 2000, and July 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997, which have been derived from Dycom's audited consolidated financial
statements which have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. The financial data
as of and for the three-month periods ended October 27, 2001 and October 28,
2000 have been derived from Dycom's unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
accruals, that Dycom considers necessary to present fairly the results of
operations and financial position of Dycom for the periods and dates presented.
Results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for
the entire year. This data should be read in conjunction with the respective
audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Dycom, including
notes to the financial statements, incorporated in this prospectus by reference
and the "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning
on page 68.

     Dycom acquired Communications Construction Group, Inc. in July 1997, Cable
Com Inc. and Installation Technicians, Inc. in April 1998, and Niels Fugal Sons
Company in March 2000. These acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of
interests and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the
periods presented include the accounts of Communications Construction, Cable
Com, Installation Technicians and Niels Fugal. The table has been adjusted to
reflect the 3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend and
paid on January 4, 1999 and the 3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a
stock dividend and paid on February 16, 2000.

         SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
data present the effect of the pending acquisition of Arguss by Dycom, which is
to be accounted for as a purchase. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet presents the combined financial position of Dycom and Arguss as of
October 27, 2001 assuming that the acquisition had occurred as of that date. The
unaudited combined statements of operations for the year ended July 28, 2001 and
three-month period ended October 27, 2001 give effect to the acquisition of
Arguss by Dycom as if it had occurred on July 30, 2000 (the first day of Dycom's
fiscal year ended July 28, 2001). Such pro forma information is based upon the
historical consolidated financial information of Dycom and Arguss. Pro forma
operations for the year-end and three-month periods for Dycom consist of its
results of operations for the year ended July 28, 2001 and three months ended
October 27, 2001, respectively. Pro forma operations for the year end and three-
month periods for Arguss consist of its results of operations for the four
quarters ended June 30, 2001 and three months ended September 30, 2001,
respectively. The use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has
a different fiscal year end.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based
on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements,
which are preliminary and have been made solely for the purposes of developing
such pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements are not necessarily an indication of the results that would have been
achieved had the transaction been consummated as of the dates indicated or that
may be achieved in the future.

     These selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements included herein and the historical consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto of Dycom and Arguss and other financial information pertaining

Recent Developments

     On September 10, 2001, as amended on November 9, 2001, Williams
Communications, LLC filed suit against one of our subsidiaries, Niels Fugal Sons
Company, in United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma
for claims which include breach of contract with respect to a fiber-optic fiber
installation project that Niels Fugal was constructing for Williams
Communications. Williams Communications seeks an unspecified amount of damages,
including compensatory, liquidated and punitive damages. We have answered and
asserted affirmative defenses to their complaint and have filed a counterclaim
for unpaid amounts in excess of $6 million due under the contract. No trial date
has been set and discovery has not yet commenced. We believe we have meritorious
defenses against these claims and intend to defend against them vigorously. We
believe that this litigation will not materially affect our financial position
or future operating results, although no assurance can be given with respect to
the ultimate outcome of any litigation.

     On November 20, 2001, the Compensation Committee of Dycom's board of
directors approved a grant of a total of 700,000 stock options to executive
officers and employees under the 1998 Incentive Stock Option Plan, including
grants in the following amounts to executive officers: 75,000 to Steven E.
Nielsen, President and Chief Executive Officer; 20,000 to Timothy R. Estes,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; 10,000 to Richard L. Dunn,
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; 6,500 to Marc R. Tiller,
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; and 5,000 to Dennis P. O'Brien, Vice
President and Director of Corporate Development. The options were granted at an
exercise price of $14.34, the fair market value at the date of grant. The
options vest over a four-year period.

     The backlog of Dycom as of October 27, 2001 was $915 million. Dycom expects
to complete approximately 50% of this backlog during the twelve months following
such date.

       REASONS FOR THE ARGUSS BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION; FACTORS CONSIDERED

     In making its recommendations to the stockholders with respect to the offer
and the merger, the Arguss board of directors considered a number of factors,
the most material of which were the following:

          Transaction Financial Terms/Premium to Market Price.  The relationship
     between the historical and current market prices of, and recent trading
     activity in, the Arguss shares and the Dycom shares, in particular the fact
     that the consideration to be paid by Dycom of 0.3333 Dycom shares per
     Arguss share in the offer and the merger represents a premium of
     approximately 30.5% over the closing price per share of the Arguss shares
     on January 4, 2002, the last trading day prior to the public announcement
     of the merger agreement.

          Allen & Company Analysis.  The financial presentations to the Arguss
     board in connection with the Arguss board's consideration of the merger
     transactions, including the oral opinion of Allen & Company delivered to
     the Arguss board at its January 4, 2002 meeting, and subsequently confirmed
     in writing, that the consideration to be received by the holders of Arguss
     shares was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The
     analyses performed by Allen & Company are described under "The
     Offer -- Opinion of Financial Advisor to Arguss" on page 44. The entire
     text of the written opinion dated January 7, 2002, regarding the offer and
     the merger, setting forth the assumptions made, matters considered and
     limitations in connection with such opinion, is included herewith as Annex
     C to this prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. STOCKHOLDERS
     ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD, READ SUCH OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY. In considering
     Allen & Company's fairness opinion, the Arguss board took into account the
     fact that Arguss had agreed to pay Allen & Company certain fees for its
     services as described below.

          Dycom Operating and Financial Condition.  The business reputation and
     current and historical financial condition and results of operations of
     Dycom in light of industry conditions over time, which the Arguss board
     believed supported its conclusion that the transaction would be beneficial
     to the long-term interests of the holders of Arguss shares, as well as the
     results of financial due diligence on Dycom performed by senior management
     of Arguss and Arguss' financial advisors.

          Arguss Operating and Financial Condition.  The Arguss board's
     knowledge of Arguss' business, current and historical financial condition
     and results of operations, current business strategy, the nature of the
     markets in which Arguss operates and its position in such markets, the
     consolidation occurring in the industry and Arguss' future growth prospects
     on a stand-alone basis, as well as the risks and uncertainties associated
     with such opportunities and Arguss' ability to take advantage of such
     opportunities given its size and capitalization.

          Benefits of Combination.  The fact that the merger of the businesses
     of Dycom and Arguss is expected to lead to potential cost savings and other
     synergies.

          Form of Consideration.  The liquidity of the Dycom shares, which will
     give the holders of Arguss shares the flexibility to either sell Dycom
     shares or continue to hold such stock and receive the benefits of retaining
     such stock without having to pay taxes upon the acquisition of such stock
     as a result of the tax-free nature of the share exchange with Dycom.

          Strategic Alternatives.  Other possible alternatives to the offer and
     the merger, the value to Arguss stockholders of such alternatives and the
     timing and likelihood of achieving superior value from these alternatives,
     as well as the possibility that equally suitable partners for an
     acquisition or a business combination transaction would be available. In
     this regard, the Arguss board considered the fact that, despite Arguss' and
     Allen & Company's efforts to identify other alternative acquisition
     candidates, no other parties had approached Arguss with an offer for an
     acquisition or a business combination. The Arguss board also considered the
     possibility of remaining an independent company. The Arguss board concluded
     that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
     offer and the merger, were superior to any other alternatives.

          Alternative Transactions.  The fact that under the terms of the merger
     agreement, while Arguss is prohibited from soliciting acquisition proposals
     from third parties, Arguss may, after providing proper notice to Dycom,
     furnish information to and participate in negotiations with third parties
     in response to an unsolicited written acquisition proposal if the Arguss
     board (a) determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
     its financial advisors, that such proposal is reasonably likely to
     constitute a superior proposal, and (b) determines in its good faith
     judgment, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that it is
     necessary to furnish information to, and participate in negotiations with,
     such third party in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
     applicable law. Further, the Arguss board noted that it would be permitted,
     subject to the payment to Dycom of a $2.5 million termination fee and
     reimbursement of Dycom's expenses up to $1.5 million, to terminate the
     merger agreement if, prior to consummation of the offer, a superior
     proposal is received by Arguss and the Arguss board reasonably determines
     in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that it
     is necessary to terminate the merger agreement and enter into a new
     agreement to effect the superior proposal in order to comply with its
     fiduciary duties under applicable law.

          Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The terms and conditions of the offer,
     the merger and the merger agreement, including the structure of the
     transaction as an exchange offer for all of the Arguss shares followed by a
     merger where all stockholders of Arguss would receive the same
     consideration per Arguss share as was received by the stockholders of
     Arguss who validly tendered into the offer. The Arguss board also
     considered the fact that the merger agreement provides for the first-step
     offer, thereby enabling holders of Arguss shares who tender their shares to
     receive the merger consideration promptly following the offer's acceptance
     by Dycom.

     The Arguss board also considered certain countervailing factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger agreement, the offer and the merger,
including the requirement under the merger agreement that Arguss pay a
termination fee of $2.5 million in cash and Dycom's transaction expenses up to
$1.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances
specified in the merger agreement, including, among others, if the Arguss board
exercised its right to terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior
proposal, as discussed in "-- Alternative Transactions" above. Although the
Arguss board recognized that this requirement could result in significant fees
being borne by Arguss, it accepted this provision as a means to obtain other
terms favorable to Arguss, in particular, the right to negotiate or exchange
information with potential bidders and to terminate the merger agreement under
the limited circumstances discussed in "-- Alternative Transactions" above, as
well as reimbursement of Arguss' expenses up to $1 million if the merger
agreement is terminated under certain other limited circumstances set forth in
the merger agreement.

     The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Arguss board is not
meant to be all inclusive, but includes the material factors considered by the
Arguss board in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby and in recommending that stockholders of Arguss tender their Arguss
shares pursuant to the offer. The Arguss board did not find it practicable to,
and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered. In addition, individual members of the Arguss board may have
given different weights to different factors. After weighing all these
considerations, the Arguss board has determined that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, are
fair to and in the best interests of Arguss and Arguss stockholders, has
approved, adopted and declared the advisability of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, and
recommends that Arguss stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares
pursuant to the offer.

                            BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     Prior to entering into discussions with Arguss, Dycom had carefully
followed the developments in the telecommunications infrastructure industry. In
response, Dycom has, from time to time, consulted with its financial advisors,
and reviewed various strategic alternatives, including the possibility of
acquiring or merging with other companies involved in its industry and has, over
the past several years, consummated several acquisitions.

     Similarly, from time to time, Arguss has reviewed its strategic
alternatives, including remaining as an independent public company, the
possibility of acquiring or merging with other companies and other transactions.
Arguss' consideration of strategic alternatives intensified during 2001 in light
of developments in the telecommunications and telecommunications infrastructure
industries. On December 3, 2001, following the commencement by certain
stockholders of a consent solicitation for control of the Arguss board of
directors, Arguss retained Allen & Company as its financial advisor to assist in
its review of strategic alternatives.

     On November 30, 2001, following the announcement of the commencement of the
consent solicitation, a representative of Banc of America Securities LLC, one of
Dycom's financial advisors, contacted Steven E. Nielsen, Dycom's Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, by telephone to ask if Mr. Nielsen was
interested in meeting Rainer H. Bosselmann, Arguss' Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, to discuss possible strategic opportunities.

     On December 4, 2001, Mr. Nielsen discussed with his management team the
possibility of a strategic transaction with Arguss. On the same day, a
representative of Banc of America Securities contacted Mr. Nielsen again to ask
if he would be available to meet with Mr. Bosselmann. Mr. Nielsen suggested a
meeting date of December 11, 2001.

     On December 5, 2001, a representative of Banc of America Securities
contacted Mr. Bosselmann to suggest a meeting between Mr. Nielsen and Mr.
Bosselmann. Mr. Bosselmann discussed the merits of such a meeting with James W.
Quinn, a representative of Allen & Company and a member of the board of
directors of Arguss, and asked Mr. Quinn to contact Mr. Nielsen to arrange the
details of the December 11, 2001 meeting.

     On December 11, 2001, Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Bosselmann, along with members of
Arguss' senior management, representatives of Allen & Company and a
representative from Banc of America Securities, met in Rockville, Maryland and
discussed the industry in general and Mr. Bosselmann provided Mr. Nielsen with
information about Arguss. The parties also discussed, on a preliminary basis,
the merits of a possible transaction between Dycom and Arguss, including the
potential value and strategic benefits that would be realized by the
stockholders of Dycom and Arguss. Mr. Bosselmann suggested an acquisition of
Arguss by Dycom could be an attractive opportunity for both companies and that
Arguss would consider a transaction of this nature if structured as a
share-for-share exchange. At this meeting, they also discussed the ongoing
consent solicitation for control of Arguss' board. In addition, they negotiated
and executed a confidentiality agreement to facilitate the exchange of
information between the parties. Mr. Nielsen informed Mr. Bosselmann that he
would consider the merits of a possible transaction and would wait for a
representative of Allen & Company to contact him with further information.
Following this meeting, Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Bosselmann briefed the members of
their respective senior management teams and each management team began a more
detailed review of a possible combination based on publicly available
information.

     On December 12, 2001, Mr. Quinn contacted Mr. Nielsen by telephone to
discuss, generally, the terms of a possible transaction, including the form of
consideration, structure of the transaction and the transaction process. Mr.
Nielsen informed him that Dycom would respond the following day.

     During December 2001, Dycom retained Merrill Lynch & Co. and Banc of
America Securities as financial advisors and outside legal counsel to advise on
the possible transaction with Arguss. Arguss, having already retained Allen &
Company as their financial advisor, retained legal counsel for this purpose.

During this period, Allen & Company solicited indications of interest from other
companies in connection with possible transactions with Arguss.

     On December 13, 2001, Mr. Nielsen, along with a representative of Merrill
Lynch, contacted Mr. Quinn and other representatives of Allen & Company and
indicated that Dycom was interested in continuing discussions with Arguss in
connection with a transaction between the companies and that Dycom was
interested in beginning a more detailed due diligence review of Arguss. At that
time, Mr. Nielsen indicated a broad range of value that Dycom might consider.
Representatives of Allen & Company reviewed this broad range of value with
members of Arguss' management and discussed the other strategic alternatives
available to Arguss. As a result of these discussions, Arguss' senior management
decided to continue discussions with Dycom and, after further analysis by Allen
& Company, respond to Dycom's proposal.

     On December 14, 2001, Mr. Bosselmann contacted Allen & Company by telephone
to further discuss the proposed transaction with Dycom and possible exchange
ratios. Following that discussion, Mr. Bosselmann contacted Mr. Nielsen by
telephone to discuss the terms and structure of the proposed transaction. At
that time, Mr. Bosselmann proposed an exchange ratio of one Dycom share for
three Arguss shares. Later that same day, after discussions with members of
senior management of Dycom and representatives of Merrill Lynch, Mr. Nielsen
contacted Mr. Bosselmann by telephone and indicated that an exchange ratio of
0.3333 Dycom shares for each Arguss share would be considered by Dycom, subject
to satisfactory completion of due diligence by Dycom and its advisors and by
Arguss and its advisors.

     On December 17, 2001, Arguss and Allen & Company, along with
representatives of Merrill Lynch and Dycom's outside legal counsel, participated
in a conference call to discuss the types of information that would be required
by senior management and financial and legal advisors in order to prepare
operational, financial and legal analyses necessary for, and the process and
conduct with respect to, due diligence review.

     On December 18, 2001, representatives of Dycom and Arguss met in Rockville,
Maryland to, on a preliminary basis, discuss financial, business and operational
information about both companies. Representatives of Dycom and representatives
of Arguss each made presentations about their respective businesses. These
meetings continued on December 19, 2001 with representatives of Merrill Lynch
and Banc of America Securities and representatives of Allen & Company also
present.

     During the period from December 20, 2001 through January 4, 2002,
representatives of Dycom and Arguss continued to meet in both Rockville,
Maryland and Epsom, New Hampshire to discuss financial and operational
information about both companies and to continue their respective due diligence
examinations. Representatives of Merrill Lynch and Banc of America Securities
and Dycom's outside legal counsel and representatives of Allen & Company and
Arguss' outside legal counsel were frequently present at these meetings. At
these meetings, Mr. Bosselmann, other senior members of Arguss management and
Arguss' outside legal counsel provided current information about the consent
solicitation.

     During the period from December 21, 2001 to January 4, 2002,
representatives from Dycom, Arguss, and their respective legal counsel
negotiated specific terms of the merger agreement and the stockholders
agreement, including the conditions to the offer, the circumstances under which
termination fees would be payable, the non-solicitation provisions, the
circumstances under which the parties could terminate the merger agreement and
fees and expenses payable in connection with termination of the merger
agreement.

     On December 21, 2001, Mr. Nielsen informed by telephone individual members
of the Dycom board as to his discussions with Arguss and Allen & Company, the
status of Dycom's due diligence examination of Arguss and the status of
negotiations.

     During the period between December 5, 2001 and January 4, 2002, Mr.
Bosselmann informed by telephone individual members of the Arguss board as to
the discussions with Dycom, the status of Arguss' due diligence examination of
Dycom, the status of negotiations and the status of the consent solicitation.

     On January 4, 2002, Mr. Nielsen and Mr. Bosselmann discussed terms of the
transaction and, based upon discussions with their respective senior management,
agreed to the exchange ratio of 0.3333 Dycom shares for each Arguss share,
subject to satisfactory resolution of all other outstanding issues.

     On January 4, 2002, Arguss held a special meeting of the Arguss board to
consider the proposed transaction with Dycom. At that meeting, Arguss management
and representatives of Allen & Company and Arguss' outside legal counsel updated
the Arguss board regarding the financial and legal aspects of the proposed
transaction. Allen & Company made a presentation to the Arguss board and
delivered its oral opinion to the effect that as of that date the consideration
to be received by holders of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer and the merger
was fair from a financial point of view.

     On January 5, 2002, Dycom held a special telephonic meeting of its board of
directors. After discussion, which included updates regarding the financial and
legal aspects of the proposed transaction from Dycom management and
representatives of Dycom's outside legal and financial advisors, the Dycom board
of directors unanimously approved the offer and the merger and unanimously
approved and adopted the merger agreement and the stockholders' agreement.

     On January 7, 2002, Arguss held a special telephonic meeting of the Arguss
board to further consider the proposed transaction with Dycom. After discussion,
which included further updates regarding the financial and legal aspects of the
proposed transaction from Allen & Company and Arguss' outside legal counsel,
Allen & Company delivered its written opinion to the effect that as of that date
the consideration to be received by holders of Arguss shares pursuant to the
offer and the merger was fair from a financial point of view to those holders,
and the Arguss board of directors approved the transaction and approved and
adopted the merger agreement and the stockholders' agreement.

     Later on January 7, 2002, Dycom and Arguss executed the merger agreement
and the stockholders' agreement and prior to the opening of the New York Stock
Exchange on that day, Dycom and Arguss issued joint press releases announcing
the transaction.

                                   THE OFFER

BASIC TERMS

     Exchange of Shares and Exchange Ratio.  We are offering to exchange 0.3333
Dycom shares, including the associated preferred share purchase right, subject
to the limitation described below, for each outstanding Arguss share, including
the associated preferred stock purchase right, validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn in accordance with the procedures described in this prospectus and the
related letter of transmittal.

     You will not receive any fractional Dycom shares. Instead, you will receive
cash in an amount equal to the market value of any fractional shares you would
otherwise have been entitled to receive.

     The expiration date is 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday,
February 20, 2002, unless we (subject to the terms and conditions of the offer
and the merger agreement, as described below) extend the period during which the
offer is open, in which case the expiration date will be the latest time and
date at which the offer, as so extended, will expire.

     Preferred Stock Purchase Rights.  Our offer to acquire Arguss shares is
also an offer to acquire the Arguss preferred stock purchase right and, when we
refer to the Arguss shares, we are also referring to the associated Arguss
preferred stock purchase right. In addition, all references to the Arguss rights
include the benefits to holders of those rights pursuant to the Arguss rights
agreement, as amended. The number of Dycom shares receivable by holders of
Arguss shares in the offer and the merger includes payment for the associated
Arguss rights, and under no circumstances will additional consideration be paid
for the Arguss rights. Also, the Dycom shares to be issued in the offer and the
merger include the associated Dycom preferred share purchase right. When we
refer to Dycom shares, we are also referring to the associated right, unless we
indicate otherwise.

     Transfer Charges.  If you are the record holder of your shares and you
tender your shares directly to the exchange agent, you will not be obligated to
pay any charges or expenses of the exchange agent or any brokerage commissions.
If you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker
tenders the shares on your behalf, your broker may charge you a fee for doing
so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges
will apply. Except as set forth in the instructions to the letter of
transmittal, transfer taxes on the exchange of Arguss common stock pursuant to
our offer will be paid by Arguss.

     Conditions to the Offer.  Our obligation to exchange Dycom shares for
Arguss shares pursuant to the offer is subject to several conditions referred to
below under "-- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page 39, including the
minimum tender condition and regulatory approvals.

     We are making this offer in order to acquire at least a majority of the
total number of outstanding Arguss shares. We intend, as soon as possible after
completion of the offer, to have Purchaser merge with and into Arguss. The
purpose of the merger is to acquire all Arguss shares not tendered and exchanged
pursuant to the offer. In the merger, each then outstanding Arguss share, except
for, if applicable, Arguss shares held in Arguss' treasury or by us or by
stockholders exercising appraisal rights, would be converted into the same
number of Dycom shares per Arguss share as is paid in the offer.

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     We expressly reserve the right, in our sole discretion (subject to the
provisions of the merger agreement), at any time or from time to time, to extend
the period of time during which our offer remains open (a) beyond the initial
scheduled expiration date or extension of the offer if, at the scheduled or
extended expiration date of the offer, any of the conditions to the offer have
not been satisfied or waived, until the conditions to the offer are satisfied or
waived, (b) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC applicable to the offer or (c) for an aggregate period of
not more than ten business days beyond the latest applicable date that would
otherwise be permitted under clause (a) or (b) above, if, as of the expiration
date, all of the conditions to the offer have been satisfied

or waived but the number of Arguss shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
equals more than 50%, but less than 90%, of the outstanding Arguss shares on a
fully diluted basis. We can extend our offer by giving oral or written notice of
such extension to the exchange agent. If we decide to extend our offer, we will
make an announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. We are
not making any assurances that we will exercise our right to extend our offer.
However, we have agreed, pursuant to the merger agreement, to extend the offer
if the minimum tender condition is not met, until the minimum tender condition
has been satisfied, for up to 15 business days after the initial scheduled
expiration date.

     During any such extension, all Arguss shares previously tendered and not
properly withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to your right to
withdraw your Arguss shares. You should read the discussion below under the
caption "-- Withdrawal Rights" for more details.

     Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations and the terms of the
merger agreement, we also reserve the right in our sole discretion, at any time
or from time to time, (a) to delay acceptance for exchange of, or, regardless of
whether we previously accepted Arguss shares, exchange any Arguss shares
pursuant to our offer or to terminate our offer and not accept for exchange, or
exchange, any Arguss shares not previously accepted for exchange, or exchanged,
upon the failure of any of the conditions of the offer to be satisfied on or
before February 20, 2002 and (b) to waive any of the conditions to the offer and
to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the offer, provided that we
will not make any change in the form of consideration to be paid, decrease the
consideration payable in the offer, reduce the maximum number of Arguss shares
to be purchased in the offer, impose conditions to the offer in addition to
those set forth in the merger agreement, or make any other change that is
adverse to the holders of Arguss shares. We will give oral or written notice of
any such delay, termination or amendment to the exchange agent and by making a
public announcement.

     We will make a public announcement of any extension, termination, amendment
or delay as promptly as practicable. In the case of an extension, any
announcement will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to
applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, which require that any material change in the information published, sent
or given to Arguss stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly sent to
stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the
change) and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make any
public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise
communicate any such public announcement other than by making a release to the
Dow Jones News Service or the PR Newswire Association, Inc.

     If we make a material change in the terms of our offer or the information
concerning the offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will
extend the offer to the extent required by the Exchange Act. If, prior to the
expiration date, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we change the
percentage of Arguss shares being sought or the consideration we are offering,
that change will apply to all holders whose Arguss shares are accepted for
exchange pursuant to our offer. If at the time notice of that change is first
published, sent or given to you, the offer is scheduled to expire at any time
earlier than the tenth business day from and including the date that the notice
is first so published, sent or given, we will extend the offer until the
expiration of that ten business day period.

     For purposes of our offer, a "business day" means any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01
a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

     We may, although we do not currently intend to, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period of three to 20 business days after the acceptance of
Arguss shares in the offer if, among other things, on the expiration date of the
offer all of the conditions to our obligations to accept for exchange, and to
exchange, the Arguss shares are satisfied or waived and we immediately accept
for exchange, and promptly exchange, all Arguss shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration date. If we elect to provide a subsequent
offering period, we may do so by giving oral or written notice of the subsequent
offering period

to the exchange agent and we will make a public announcement of the results of
the exchange offer, including the approximate number and percentage of Arguss
shares deposited, no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next
business day after the expiration date of the initial offering period and
immediately begin the subsequent offering period. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO
WITHDRAW ARGUSS SHARES THAT YOU TENDER IN THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD, IF
ANY.

EXCHANGE OF ARGUSS SHARES; DELIVERY OF DYCOM SHARES

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer, including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of the extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, Arguss shares validly
tendered, and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration date, as promptly
as practicable after the expiration date. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, subject to applicable rules of the SEC and the terms of the
merger agreement, we expressly reserve the right to delay acceptance for
exchange, or the exchange of, Arguss shares in order to comply with any
applicable law or obtain any governmental or regulatory approvals.

     If we decide to include a subsequent offering period, we will accept for
exchange, and promptly exchange, all validly tendered Arguss shares as they are
received during the subsequent offering period. See "-- Extension, Termination
and Amendment."

     In all cases (including during any subsequent offering period), exchange of
Arguss shares tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the offer will be
made only after timely receipt by the exchange agent of (a) certificates for
those Arguss shares, or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer of those Arguss
shares in the exchange agent's account at The Depository Trust Company, or DTC,
pursuant to the procedures outlined in the section below entitled "-- Procedure
for Tendering," (b) a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal
(or a manually signed facsimile of that document), with any required signature
guarantees or an agent's message, in the case of a book-entry transfer, as
described below under "-- Procedure for Tendering" and (c) any other required
documents.

     For purposes of the offer, including during any subsequent offering period,
we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange, and thereby exchanged, Arguss
shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as of, if and when we notify
the exchange agent of our acceptance of the tenders of those Arguss shares
pursuant to the offer. The exchange agent will deliver Dycom shares in exchange
for Arguss shares pursuant to the offer and cash instead of fractional Dycom
shares as soon as practicable after receipt of our notice. The exchange agent
will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving Dycom
shares and any cash to be paid instead of fractional Dycom shares and
transmitting the stock and cash, if any, to you. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY
INTEREST ON ANY CASH THAT WE PAY YOU, EVEN IF THERE IS A DELAY IN MAKING THE
EXCHANGE.

     If we do not accept any tendered Arguss shares for exchange pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are
submitted for more Arguss shares than are tendered, we will return certificates
for the unexchanged Arguss shares, without expense, to the tendering stockholder
or, in the case of Arguss shares tendered by book-entry transfer of unexchanged
Arguss shares into the exchange agent's account at DTC pursuant to the
procedures outlined under the section below entitled "-- Procedure for
Tendering," those Arguss shares will be credited to an account maintained within
DTC, as soon as practicable following expiration or termination of the offer.

     We reserve the right to transfer or assign, from time to time, in whole or
in part, to one or more of our affiliates, the right to purchase all or any of
the Arguss shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve us of our obligations under the offer and will not
prejudice your rights to receive Dycom shares and cash instead of fractional
Dycom shares for Arguss shares validly tendered and accepted for exchange
pursuant to the offer.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL DYCOM SHARES

     We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares pursuant to
the offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled
to a fractional Dycom share will receive cash in an amount equal to that
fraction multiplied by the average of the per share closing prices of our shares
on the New York Stock Exchange on the first date on which we accept shares for
exchange in the offer. A stockholder who receives cash instead of fractional
Dycom shares will recognize gain or loss on the receipt of the cash to the
extent that the cash received exceeds the tax basis that would have been
allocated to that stockholder's fractional shares. You are urged to carefully
read the discussion under "The Offer -- Material United States Federal Income
Tax Consequences" beginning on page 36, and to consult your tax advisor on the
consequences to you of the offer and/or merger.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Arguss shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time
prior to the acceptance date, and, unless we have previously accepted them
pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after March 23, 2002.
Once we accept Arguss shares for exchange pursuant to the offer, your tender is
irrevocable. IF WE ELECT TO PROVIDE A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD UNDER EXCHANGE
ACT RULE 14D-11, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW ARGUSS SHARES THAT YOU
TENDER IN THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD.

     For your withdrawal to be effective, the exchange agent must receive from
you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one of
its addresses set forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice
must include your name, address, social security number, the certificate number
or numbers and the number of Arguss shares to be withdrawn as well as the name
of the registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who
tendered those Arguss shares.

     A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal, unless those Arguss shares have been tendered for the account of an
eligible institution. If physical certificates have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the exchange agent, the name of the registered holder and the
serial numbers of the particular certificates evidencing the Arguss shares
withdrawn must also be furnished to the exchange agent, as stated above, prior
to the physical release of the certificates. If Arguss shares have been tendered
pursuant to the procedures for book-entry tender discussed under the section
entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the
name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn Arguss
shares and must otherwise comply with DTC's procedures.

     WE WILL DECIDE ALL QUESTIONS AS TO THE FORM AND VALIDITY (INCLUDING TIME OF
RECEIPT) OF ANY NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, AND OUR DECISION
WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NEITHER WE, THE EXCHANGE AGENT, THE INFORMATION
AGENT, THE DEALER MANAGER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WILL BE UNDER ANY DUTY TO GIVE
NOTIFICATION OF ANY DEFECTS OR IRREGULARITIES IN ANY NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OR
WILL INCUR ANY LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO GIVE ANY NOTIFICATION.

     Any Arguss shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been
validly tendered for purposes of our offer. However, you may retender withdrawn
Arguss shares by following one of the procedures discussed under the caption
below entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering" at any time prior to the expiration
date.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING

     Arguss has provided us with its stockholder list and security positions
listing, including the most recent list of names, addresses and security
positions of non-objecting beneficial owners in the possession of Arguss shares,
for the purpose of disseminating the offer to Arguss' stockholders. We will mail
this offer and the related letter of transmittal to record holders of Arguss'
shares whose names appear on this stockholder list and we will furnish this
offer and the related letter of transmittal for subsequent transmittal to
beneficial owners of Arguss shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and similar

persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder
list or, if applicable, who are listed on or are participants in a clearing
agency's security position listing.

     For you to validly tender Arguss shares pursuant to the offer you must
either (a) properly complete and duly execute a letter of transmittal (or a
manually executed facsimile of that document), along with any required signature
guarantees or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other required documents, all of which must be transmitted to and received
by the exchange agent at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of
this prospectus, and certificates for tendered Arguss shares must be received by
the exchange agent at such address or those Arguss shares must be tendered
pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth below (a tender by
book-entry transfer will be completed upon receipt by the exchange agent of a
confirmation, which we refer to as a book-entry confirmation) or (b) if your
certificates are not immediately available or you cannot complete the procedure
for book-entry transfer on a timely basis, comply with the guaranteed delivery
procedures outlined below in the section entitled "-- Guaranteed Delivery."

     The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in DTC tendering the Arguss shares which are the subject of the
book-entry confirmation, that the participant has received and agrees to be
bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce that
agreement against the participant.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The exchange agent will establish accounts with
respect to the Arguss shares at DTC for purposes of the offer within two
business days after the date of this prospectus, and any financial institution
that is a participant in DTC may make book-entry delivery of the Arguss shares
by causing DTC to transfer such Arguss shares into the exchange agent's account
at DTC in accordance with DTC's procedure for the transfer. However, although
delivery of Arguss shares may be effected through book-entry at DTC, you must
transmit to the exchange agent at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover page of this prospectus, the letter of transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's
message, and any other required documents, or you must follow the guaranteed
delivery procedures described below. A tender by book-entry transfer will be
completed upon receipt by the exchange agent prior to the expiration date or the
expiration of the subsequent offering period, if any, of all such documents and
of a book-entry confirmation from DTC. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO DTC DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

     Signature Guarantees.  Signatures on all letters of transmittal must be
guaranteed by an eligible institution, except in cases in which Arguss shares
are tendered either by a registered holder of Arguss shares who has not
completed the box entitled "Special Issuance Instructions" on the letter of
transmittal, or for the account of an eligible institution.

     If the certificates for Arguss shares are registered in the name of a
person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or if
certificates for unexchanged Arguss shares are to be issued to a person other
than the registered holder or holders, the certificates must be endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the
name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates, with
the signature or signatures on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed by an
eligible institution.

     The method of delivery of Arguss share certificates and all other required
documents, including delivery through DTC, is at your option and risk, and the
delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the exchange agent.
If delivery is by mail, we recommend registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured. In all cases, you should allow sufficient time to
ensure timely delivery.

     IN ORDER TO PREVENT UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX BACKUP WITHHOLDING
WITH RESPECT TO CASH RECEIVED PURSUANT TO OUR OFFER IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL
SHARES, YOU MUST PROVIDE THE EXCHANGE AGENT WITH YOUR CORRECT TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND CERTIFY THAT YOU ARE NOT SUBJECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING
OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX BY COMPLETING THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9
INCLUDED IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. SOME ARGUSS STOCKHOLDERS (INCLUDING,
AMONG OTHERS, ALL CORPORATIONS AND SOME FOREIGN

INDIVIDUALS) ARE EXEMPT FROM THESE BACKUP WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS. IN ORDER FOR
A FOREIGN INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDER TO QUALIFY AS AN EXEMPT RECIPIENT, THE
STOCKHOLDER MUST SUBMIT AN APPLICABLE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FORM W-8, SIGNED
UNDER PENALTIES OF PERJURY, ATTESTING TO THAT INDIVIDUAL'S EXEMPT STATUS.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If you wish to tender your Arguss shares pursuant to
our offer and your certificates are not immediately available or you cannot
deliver the certificates and all other required documents to the exchange agent
prior to the expiration date, or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry
transfer on a timely basis, you may still tender your Arguss shares so long as
all of the following conditions are satisfied:

     - you make your tender by or through an eligible institution,

     - a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery,
       substantially in the form made available by us, is received by the
       exchange agent as provided below on or prior to the expiration date or
       the expiration of the subsequent offering period, and

     - the certificates for all tendered Arguss shares (or a confirmation of a
       book-entry transfer of such shares into the exchange agent's account at
       DTC as described above), in proper form for transfer, together with a
       properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a manually
       signed facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees (or, in
       the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and all other
       documents required by the letter of transmittal are received by the
       exchange agent within three New York Stock Exchange trading days after
       the date of execution of such notice of guaranteed delivery.

     You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail to the exchange agent and you must include a
signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form outlined in that
notice.

     In all cases (including during any subsequent offering period), we will
exchange Arguss shares tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to our offer
only after timely receipt by the exchange agent of (a) certificates for Arguss
shares (or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such securities into
the exchange agent's account at DTC as described above), (b) properly completed
and duly executed letter or letters of transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile thereof), along with any required signature guarantees or an agent's
message in connection with a book-entry transfer and (c) any other required
documents.

     A tender of Arguss shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above
will constitute your acceptance of the terms and conditions of our offer as well
as your representation and warranty to us that:

     - you have the full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and
       transfer the tendered shares (and any and all other Arguss shares or
       other securities issued or issuable in respect of such shares) and

     - when the same are accepted for exchange, we will acquire good and
       unencumbered title to such shares, free and clear of all liens,
       restrictions, charges and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse
       claims.

     Appointment of Attorneys-In-Fact and Proxies.  By executing a letter of
transmittal, you irrevocably appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and
proxies, each with full power of substitution, to the full extent of your rights
with respect to your Arguss shares tendered and accepted for exchange by us and
with respect to any and all other Arguss shares and other securities issued or
issuable in respect of those Arguss shares on or after January 7, 2002. That
appointment is effective, and voting rights will be affected, when and only to
the extent that we deposit the Dycom shares payable as consideration for the
Arguss shares that you have tendered with the exchange agent. All such proxies
will be considered coupled with an interest in the tendered Arguss shares and
therefore will not be revocable. Upon the effectiveness of such appointment, all
prior proxies that you have given will be revoked, and you may not give any
subsequent proxies (and, if given, they will not be deemed effective). Our
designees will, with respect to the Arguss shares for which the appointment is
effective, be empowered, among other things, to exercise

all of your voting and other rights as they, in their sole discretion, deem
proper at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of Arguss' stockholders or
otherwise. We reserve the right to require that, in order for Arguss shares to
be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon our exchange of those Arguss
shares, we be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such Arguss
shares.

     We will determine questions as to the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of Arguss
shares, in our sole discretion, and our determination will be final and binding.
We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of Arguss shares
that we determine are not in proper form or the acceptance of or exchange for
which may, in the opinion of our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the
absolute right to waive any of the conditions of our offer and to make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the offer, provided that we will not
make any change in the form of consideration to be paid, decrease the
consideration payable in the offer, reduce the maximum number of Arguss shares
to be purchased in the offer, impose conditions to the offer in addition to
those set forth in the merger agreement, or make any other change that is
adverse to the holders of Arguss shares. We will give oral or written notice of
any such delay, termination or amendment to the exchange agent and by making a
public announcement. No tender of Arguss shares will be deemed to have been
validly made until all defects and irregularities in tenders of Arguss shares
have been cured or waived. Neither we, the exchange agent, the information
agent, the dealer manager nor any other person will be under any duty to give
notification of any defects or irregularities in the tender of any Arguss shares
or will incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. Our
interpretation of the terms and conditions of our offer (including the letter of
transmittal and instructions thereto) will be final and binding.

     The tender of Arguss shares pursuant to any of the procedures described
above will constitute a binding agreement between us and you upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the offer.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF ARGUSS SHARE CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH DTC, IS AT YOUR OPTION AND RISK, AND THE
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE EXCHANGE AGENT.
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, WE RECOMMEND REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     Any applicable stock transfer taxes, if any, in connection with the offer,
the merger and the merger agreement will be paid by Arguss and will not be a
liability of any holder of Arguss shares.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following is a general summary of the material United States federal
income tax consequences to Arguss stockholders that exchange Arguss shares for
Dycom shares pursuant to the offer and the merger. This discussion is based on
provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and
administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect as of the
date of this prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may be applicable to Arguss stockholders in
light of their particular circumstances or to Arguss stockholders subject to
special treatment under United States federal income tax law (including, without
limitation, individuals who are neither United States citizens nor residents,
certain financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities,
dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to apply a
mark-to-market method of accounting, certain United States expatriates, persons
that hold Arguss shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or
other integrated investment, Arguss stockholders whose functional currency is
not the United States dollar and Arguss stockholders who acquired Arguss shares
through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation).
This discussion is limited to Arguss stockholders that hold their Arguss shares,
and will hold their Dycom shares, as capital assets (generally, property held
for investment), and it does not consider the United States federal income tax
treatment of Arguss stockholders that hold Arguss shares through a partnership
or other pass-through entity. Furthermore, this summary does not discuss any
aspect of United States federal tax law other than income taxation, and does not
discuss any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the offer and the
merger.

     Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by Dycom of the
opinion of Shearman & Sterling, counsel to Dycom, and the receipt by Arguss of
the opinion of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, special counsel to Arguss,
substantially to the effect that, under current United States federal income tax
law, (a) the offer and the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) each of Dycom, Purchaser and
Arguss will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code. The tax opinions will be based on and subject to certain
assumptions and limitations as well as factual representations made by Dycom,
Purchaser and Arguss. No ruling will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service
as to the United States federal income tax consequences of the offer and the
merger, and the opinions of counsel will not be binding upon the Internal
Revenue Service or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the
Internal Revenue Service will not contest the conclusions expressed in the
opinions or that a court will not sustain any contest.

     Assuming that the offer and the merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the United States federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the merger can be summarized as
follows:

     - A holder of Arguss shares will not recognize any gain or loss upon
       exchange of its Arguss shares solely for Dycom shares in the offer or the
       merger.

     - If a holder of Arguss shares receives cash instead of a fractional Dycom
       share, the holder will be required to recognize gain or loss, measured by
       the difference between the amount of cash received instead of that
       fractional Dycom share and the portion of the tax basis of that holder's
       Arguss shares allocable to that fractional share. Such gain or loss will
       be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
       the Arguss shares that would otherwise have been exchanged for that
       fractional Dycom share were held for more than one year.

     - A holder of Arguss shares will have a tax basis in the Dycom shares
       received in the offer and the merger equal to (a) the tax basis of the
       Arguss shares surrendered by that holder pursuant to the offer or in the
       merger, less (b) any tax basis of the Arguss shares surrendered that is
       allocable to any fractional Dycom share for which cash is received.

     - The holding period for Dycom shares received in exchange for Arguss
       shares in the offer and the merger will include the holding period for
       Arguss shares surrendered in the offer and the merger.

     - If an Arguss stockholder, pursuant to the exercise of its right to seek
       an appraisal, exchanges all of its Arguss shares solely for cash, such
       holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
       difference between the amount of cash received and its adjusted tax basis
       in the Arguss shares surrendered. Such gain or loss generally will be
       long-term capital gain or loss if the holder held the Arguss shares
       surrendered for more than one year as of the date of the exchange.

     As noted earlier, one of the conditions to the consummation of the merger
is the receipt by Dycom and Arguss of tax opinions from their respective counsel
with respect to the offer and the merger qualifying as a tax-free reorganization
under the Code. Such tax opinions are subject to the truth and accuracy of
certain representations made by Dycom, Purchaser, and Arguss, as well as certain
assumptions relating to, among other things, the minimum tender condition for
the offer being satisfied, and the consummation of the merger promptly after the
offer, in accordance with the current terms of the merger agreement and
applicable state law. There can be no assurance that the merger will be
completed or that other factual assumptions will be satisfied. If such
assumptions are not satisfied, an Arguss stockholder's exchange of Arguss shares
for Dycom shares in the offer or the merger could be a taxable transaction,
depending on the surrounding facts. Arguss stockholders are urged to consult
their tax advisors concerning the United States federal income and other tax
consequences of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

     The foregoing discussion is intended only as a summary and does not purport
to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential United States federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the

merger. Arguss stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning
the United States federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of
participation in the offer and/or the merger to them.

PURPOSE OF THE OFFER

     We are making the offer in order to acquire at least a majority of the
total outstanding Arguss shares. We intend, as soon as practicable after
completion of the offer, to have Purchaser merge with Arguss. The purpose of the
merger is to acquire all Arguss shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to
the offer. In the merger, each then outstanding Arguss share (except for Arguss
shares tendered, held by Arguss as treasury shares or Arguss shares owned by
Dycom, Purchaser or any of Dycom's or Purchaser's subsidiaries or by
stockholders of Arguss who perfect their appraisal rights, if any) would be
converted into the right to receive the same number of Dycom shares as is paid
per Arguss share in the offer subject to appraisal rights, if any, as may be
exercised under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL.

THE MERGER

     Approval of the Merger.  Under Section 251 of the DGCL, the approval of the
board of directors of a company and the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of its outstanding shares are required to approve and adopt a merger
agreement. The Arguss board of directors has previously approved the merger. If
we complete the offer and the minimum tender condition has been satisfied, we
would have a sufficient number of Arguss shares to approve the merger without
the affirmative vote of any other holder of Arguss shares. Therefore, unless the
merger is consummated in accordance with the short-form merger provisions under
the DGCL (described below), the only remaining required corporate action of
Arguss will be the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Arguss shares, which will
require a longer period of time to effect than would be the case with a short-
form merger. This is referred to as a long-form merger.

     Possible Short-Form Merger.  Section 253 of the DGCL would permit the
merger to occur without a vote of Arguss' stockholders in a short-form merger if
Dycom were to acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Arguss shares in the offer
or otherwise (including as a result of purchases by Dycom during any subsequent
offering period). No action by the stockholders of Arguss, other than by Dycom
acting as the 90% stockholder, will be required to consummate the merger.

     Arguss has advised Purchaser that as of January 22, 2002, 14,519,944 Arguss
shares were issued and outstanding, and 3,426,767 shares were reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock options and no shares were held
in Arguss' treasury. As a result, as of that date, the minimum tender condition
would be satisfied if Purchaser acquired 8,973,356 Arguss shares. Also, as of
such date, Purchaser could cause the merger to become effective in accordance
with Delaware Law, without a meeting of Arguss' stockholders, if Purchaser
acquired 13,067,950 Arguss shares.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Arguss stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the
offer. If we complete the offer but less than 90% of the outstanding Arguss
shares are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we intend
to effect a long-form merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 251
of the DGCL. Arguss stockholders who have not exchanged their Arguss shares in
the offer will not have appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger.

     However, if at least 90% of the outstanding Arguss shares are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we intend to effect a
short-form merger, and Arguss stockholders at the time of a short-form merger
will have the right under Section 262 of the DGCL to dissent and demand
appraisal of their Arguss shares. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, dissenting
stockholders who comply with the applicable statutory procedures will be
entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of their Arguss
shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of this fair value in cash,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any. We

cannot assure you as to the methodology a court would use to determine fair
value or how a court would select which of the elements of value are to be
included in such a determination.

     The foregoing discussion is not a complete statement of the law relating to
appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by the summary of procedures
for seeking appraisal rights, which is set out in Annex D to this prospectus and
incorporated herein by reference, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL,
which is reprinted in its entirety after the summary in Annex D to this
prospectus and incorporated herein by reference.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

     The offer is subject to a number of conditions, which are described below:

          Minimum Tender Condition.  There must be validly tendered and not
     properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer the number of
     Arguss shares that, together with the Arguss shares then owned by Dycom and
     Purchaser, will constitute at least a majority of the total number of
     outstanding Arguss shares on a fully diluted basis (as though all options
     exercisable for Arguss shares had been converted, exercised or exchanged)
     as of the date that we accept the Arguss shares pursuant to our offer.
     Based on information supplied by Arguss, the number of Arguss shares needed
     to satisfy the minimum tender condition would have been 8,973,356 as of
     January 22, 2002.

          Antitrust Approvals.  All applicable waiting periods under the
     Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or HSR
     Act, must have expired or been terminated and any required consents and
     clearances must have been obtained.

          Registration Statement Effectiveness.  The registration statement on
     Form S-4, of which this prospectus is a part, must have been declared
     effective under the Securities Act of 1933 and must not be the subject of
     any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order.

          New York Stock Exchange Listing.  The Dycom shares issuable to Arguss
     stockholders in the offer and the merger must have been approved for
     listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of
     issuance.

          Other Conditions of the Offer.  The offer is also subject to the
     condition that, at the time of acceptance for exchange of Arguss shares
     pursuant to the offer, there will not be existing and continuing any of the
     following events or circumstances:

             (1) there will have been instituted or pending any litigation,
        suit, claim, action or proceeding before any federal or state court of
        the United States (other than (a) any such action in which a motion for
        a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent
        injunction will have been denied or will have expired, or a judicial
        order granting any such temporary restraining order, preliminary
        injunction or permanent injunction will have been reversed on appeal and
        not reinstated, (b) any such action or proceeding in which the United
        States Department of Justice, or the Federal Trade Commission or any
        applicable state authority does not file within 10 business days after
        commencement of such action a motion seeking injunctive relief of the
        type referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of this paragraph (1), or
        (c) an action filed with consent of Purchaser) by any United States
        federal government or governmental authority or agency or any of the
        several states of the United States or any attorney general thereof (i)
        challenging or seeking to make illegal, materially delay, or otherwise,
        directly or indirectly, restrain or prohibit or make materially more
        costly, the making of the offer, the acceptance for exchange of any
        Arguss shares by Dycom, Purchaser or any other affiliate of Dycom, or
        the consummation of any other transaction contemplated by the merger
        agreement; (ii) seeking an order of divestiture that, if complied with,
        would, in Dycom's reasonable judgment, be expected to have a material
        adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial
        condition of Dycom, Arguss and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
        after giving effect to the offer and the merger; or (iii) seeking to
        impose or confirm any limitation on the ability of Dycom, Purchaser or
        any other subsidiary of Dycom to exercise effectively full rights of

        ownership of any Arguss shares on all matters properly presented to the
        Arguss' stockholders, including, without limitation, the approval and
        adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
        the merger agreement;

             (2) there will have been (a) any law enacted, promulgated, amended,
        issued or deemed applicable to (i) Dycom, Arguss or any of their
        respective subsidiaries or (ii) any transaction contemplated by the
        merger agreement or (b) entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or
        governmental authority, any order of any kind which prohibits,
        restrains, restricts or enjoins the consummation of the offer or has the
        effect of making the offer illegal, in each case, by any legislative
        body or governmental authority that would result, directly or
        indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i)
        through (iii) of paragraph (1) above;

             (3) there will have occurred and be continuing (a) any general
        suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on the
        New York Stock Exchange (other than a shortening of trading hours or any
        coordinated trading halt triggered solely as a result of a specified
        increase or decrease in a market index), (b) a decline, measured from
        the date hereof, in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in excess of 25%,
        (c) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments
        in respect of banks in the United States, (d) any new and material
        limitation (whether or not mandatory) by any United States government or
        governmental authority (as defined in the merger agreement), on the
        extension of credit by United States banks or other lending
        institutions, (e) a commencement of a war or armed hostilities or other
        national or international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
        United States not existing on the date of the merger agreement (the
        announced "War on Terrorism" resulting from the September 11, 2001
        terrorist attacks will be deemed existing on the date of the merger
        agreement) or (f) in the case of any of the foregoing existing on the
        date of the merger agreement, including, without limitation, the
        announced War on Terrorism, a material acceleration or worsening
        thereof, it being understood that any air strike against, or special
        operations involving a limited number of ground troops in, the countries
        of Somalia or Yemen will not be considered a material acceleration or
        worsening of the War on Terrorism;

             (4) other than with respect to any order that is the subject of
        paragraph (1) or (2) above, there will have been enacted, entered,
        promulgated or enforced by any court or governmental authority any order
        which prohibits, restrains, restricts or enjoins the consummation of the
        offer or has the effect of making the offer illegal;

             (5) (a) Arguss will have breached or failed to perform in any
        material respect its obligations, covenants or agreements under the
        merger agreement, (b) the representations and warranties of Arguss
        contained in the merger agreement that are qualified by reference to
        materiality or an Arguss material adverse effect (as defined in the
        merger agreement) will not have been true and correct in all respects
        when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the offer as if
        made at and as of such time (other than representations and warranties
        which by their terms address matters only as of another specified date,
        which will be true and correct in all respects only as of such date), or
        (c) the representations and warranties of Arguss contained in the merger
        agreement that are not so qualified will not have been true and correct
        when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the offer as if
        made at and as of such time (other than representations and warranties
        which by their terms address matters only as of another specified date,
        which will be true and correct only as of such date), except, in the
        case of clause (c) only, for such failures to be true and correct as are
        not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
        material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on Arguss;

             (6)(a) it will have been publicly disclosed, or Dycom will have
        otherwise learned, that beneficial ownership (determined for the
        purposes of this paragraph as set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange
        Act) of 20% or more of the then-outstanding Arguss shares have been
        acquired by any person, other than Dycom or any of its affiliates, or
        (b) (i) the Arguss board of directors, or

        any committee thereof, will have withdrawn or modified, in a manner
        adverse to Dycom or Purchaser including by amending the Schedule 14D-9,
        the approval or recommendation of the offer, the merger, the merger
        agreement, or approved or recommended any superior proposal or any other
        acquisition of Arguss common stock other than the offer and the merger
        or (ii) the Arguss board, or any committee thereof, will have resolved
        to do any of the foregoing;

             (7) the merger agreement will have been terminated in accordance
        with its terms; and

             (8) the Amendment to Forbearance and Modification Agreement and
        Waiver, dated as of December 26, 2001, among Arguss and certain of its
        lenders will not have been amended to extend the forbearance period
        until the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination
        of the merger agreement;

     which, in the reasonable judgment of Dycom in any such case, and regardless
     of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Dycom or any of
     its affiliates) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to
     proceed with such acceptance for payment.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Dycom
and may be asserted by Purchaser or Dycom regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Dycom in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion. The failure by
Dycom or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not
be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect
to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right will be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Based upon our examination of publicly available information with respect
to Arguss and review of certain information furnished by Arguss, and discussions
between our representatives and representatives of Arguss during our
investigation of Arguss, see "Background of the Offer" beginning on page 27,
except as included in this prospectus, we are not aware of any licenses or
regulatory permits that appear to be material to the business of Arguss and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that might be adversely affected by our
acquisition of Arguss shares in the offer. In addition, except as outlined in
this prospectus, we are not aware of any filings, approvals or other actions by
or with any governmental authority or administrative or regulatory agency that
would be required for our acquisition or ownership of Arguss shares. Should any
such approval or other action be required, we expect to seek such approval or
action, except as described under "-- State Takeover Laws." Should any such
approval or other action be required, we cannot be certain that we would be able
to obtain any such approval or action without substantial conditions or that
adverse consequences might not result to Arguss' or its subsidiaries'
businesses, or that certain parts of Arguss', Dycom's or any of their respective
subsidiaries' businesses might not have to be disposed of or held separate in
order to obtain such approval or action. In that event, we may not be required
to purchase any Arguss shares in the offer.

     State Takeover Laws.  Arguss is incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an "interested
stockholder", generally a person, or an affiliate or associate of the person,
who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding
voting stock, from engaging in a business combination, which includes mergers
and certain other transactions, with a Delaware corporation for a period of
three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder
unless, among other things, prior to such date the board of directors of the
corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction in which
the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. On January 7, 2002,
prior to the execution of the merger agreement and the stockholders' agreement,
the Arguss board approved the merger agreement and the stockholders' agreement
and determined that each of the offer and the merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders of Arguss. Accordingly, Section 203 is
inapplicable to the offer and the merger.

     A number of states have adopted takeover laws and regulations that purport
to apply to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated
in those states or that have substantial assets, shareholders, principal
executive offices or principal places of business in those states. To the extent
that these state takeover statutes purport to apply to the offer or the merger,
we believe that those laws conflict with U.S. federal law and are an
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. In 1982, the Supreme Court of
the United States, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., invalidated on constitutional grounds
the Illinois Business Takeovers Statute, which, as a matter of state securities
law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult.
The reasoning in that decision is likely to apply to certain other state
takeover statutes. In 1987, however, in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America,
the Supreme Court of the United States held that the State of Indiana could as a
matter of corporate law and, in particular, those aspects of corporate law
concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential
acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without the prior
approval of the remaining shareholders, as long as those laws were applicable
only under certain conditions. Subsequently, in TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex
Corp., a federal district court in Oklahoma ruled that the Oklahoma statutes
were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to corporations incorporated outside
Oklahoma, because they would subject those corporations to inconsistent
regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds, a federal district
court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee takeover statutes were
unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee. This
decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. In December 1988, a federal district court in Florida held, in Grand
Metropolitan Plc v. Butterworth, that the provisions of the Florida Affiliated
Transactions Act and Florida Control Share Acquisition Act were unconstitutional
as applied to corporations incorporated outside of Florida.

     Arguss, directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts business in a number
of states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted takeover
laws. Dycom and Purchaser do not know whether any of these laws will, by their
terms, apply to the offer or the merger and have not complied with any such
laws. Should any person seek to apply any state takeover law, Purchaser will
take such action as then appears desirable, which may include challenging the
validity or applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings.
In the event it is asserted that one or more state takeover laws is applicable
to the offer or the merger, and an appropriate court does not determine that it
is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the offer, Purchaser might be required
to file certain information with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state
authorities. In addition, if enjoined, Purchaser might be unable to accept for
exchange any Arguss shares tendered pursuant to the offer, or be delayed in
continuing or consummating the offer and the merger. In such case, Purchaser may
not be obligated to accept for payment any Arguss shares tendered. See
"-- Conditions to the Offer."

     Antitrust.  Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated
thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, certain acquisition
transactions may not be consummated unless certain information has been
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, referred to
herein as the Antitrust Division and the FTC and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The exchange of Arguss shares for Dycom shares
pursuant to the offer is subject to such requirements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, Dycom filed a Premerger
Notification and Report Form with respect to the offer with the Antitrust
Division and the FTC on January 16, 2002. The HSR filing on behalf of Arguss was
made on January 17, 2002.

     Under the provisions of the HSR Act applicable to our offer, we may not
accept for exchange Arguss shares until the expiration of a 30 calendar day
waiting period following the filing by Dycom.

     Accordingly, the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
exchange of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New
York City time, on February 15, 2002, unless the waiting period is earlier
terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division or extended by a request from
the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information and documentary
material prior to the expiration of the waiting period. Pursuant to the HSR Act,
we have requested early termination of the waiting period applicable to the
offer. There can be no assurance, however, that the 30th calendar day

HSR Act waiting period will be terminated early. If either the FTC or the
Antitrust Division were to request additional information and documentary
material from Dycom with respect to the offer, the waiting period with respect
to the offer would expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 30th
calendar day after the date of substantial compliance with such requests. If the
acquisition of Arguss shares is delayed pursuant to a request by the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information and documentary material pursuant
to the HSR Act, we may, but need not, extend the offer and, in any event, the
purchase of and payment for Arguss shares will be deferred until at least 30
days after the request is substantially complied with, unless the waiting period
is sooner terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division. Only one extension
of such waiting period pursuant to a request for additional information is
authorized by the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Thereafter, the
consummation of the offer and the merger could be enjoined preliminarily or
permanently by a court order on antitrust or competition grounds, or temporarily
by the consent of Dycom and Arguss. Any such extension of the waiting period,
entry of a court injunction, or decision by Dycom and Arguss to postpone
temporarily consummation of the exchange of Arguss shares will not give rise to
any withdrawal rights not otherwise provided for by applicable law and outlined
in this prospectus. See "-- Withdrawal Rights." It is a condition to the offer
that all waiting periods applicable under the HSR Act to the offer expire or be
terminated. See "-- Conditions to the Offer."

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions such as our proposed acquisition of Arguss
shares pursuant to the offer. At any time before or after the exchange of Arguss
shares pursuant to the offer, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Arguss shares pursuant to
the offer or seeking the divestiture of Arguss shares purchased by Dycom or the
divestiture of substantial assets of Dycom, Arguss or their respective
subsidiaries. Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring legal
action under federal or state antitrust laws under certain circumstances. Based
upon an examination of information available to us relating to the businesses in
which Dycom, Arguss and their respective subsidiaries are engaged, we believe
that the offer will not violate the antitrust laws. Nevertheless, there can be
no assurance that a challenge to the offer on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if such a challenge is made, what the result would be. See "-- Conditions to
the Offer" for certain conditions to the offer, including conditions with
respect to litigation.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity; New York Stock Exchange Listing; Possible
Delisting.  The tender of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the
number of holders of Arguss shares, and the number of Arguss shares that might
otherwise trade publicly, and could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Arguss shares held by the public. Shares of Arguss common
stock are listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Depending upon the number of Arguss shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the
Arguss shares may no longer meet the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
for continued listing and may be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
According to the New York Stock Exchange's published guidelines, the New York
Stock Exchange would consider delisting the Arguss shares if, among other
things, the number of record holders of at least 100 Arguss shares should fall
below 1,200, the number of publicly held Arguss shares (exclusive of holdings of
officers, directors and their families and other concentrated holdings of 10% or
more) should fall below 600,000 or the aggregate market value of publicly held
Arguss shares should fall below $5 million.

     If the New York Stock Exchange were to delist the Arguss shares, including
after the exchange of shares in the offer but prior to the merger, the market
for them could be adversely affected. It is possible that the Arguss shares
would continue to trade on another securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be reported by
such exchange or through the Nasdaq National Market or other sources. The extent
of the public market and the availability of such quotations would depend,
however, upon such factors as the number of stockholders and/or the aggregate
market value of the stock remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a
market in the Arguss common

stock on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration
under the Exchange Act as described below, and other factors. We cannot predict
whether the reduction in the number of Arguss shares that might otherwise trade
publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or
marketability of, the Arguss common stock.

     Dycom intends to cause the delisting of Arguss common stock from the New
York Stock Exchange following consummation of the offer and the merger.

     Arguss has advised us that, as of January 22, 2002, there were 14,519,944
Arguss shares outstanding, held by approximately 111 holders of record.

     Status as "Margin Securities."  The Arguss shares are presently "margin
securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve System, which, among
other things, allows brokers to extend credit on the collateral of Arguss
shares. Depending on the factors similar to those described above with respect
to listing and market quotations, following consummation of the offer, the
Arguss shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of
the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the Arguss shares
would be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

     Going Private Transactions.  The SEC has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and
which may under certain circumstances apply to the merger or another business
combination following the purchase of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer, in
which we seek to acquire the remaining Arguss shares not held by us. We believe
that Rule 13e-3 will not apply to the merger. Rule 13e-3 would require, among
other things, that certain financial information concerning Arguss and certain
information relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the
consideration offered to minority shareholders in such transaction be filed with
the SEC and disclosed to shareholders prior to consummation of the merger or
other business combination.

     Registration Under the Exchange Act.  Arguss shares are currently
registered under the Exchange Act. Arguss can terminate that registration upon
application to the SEC if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national
securities exchange and if there are fewer than 300 holders of record of Arguss
shares. Termination of registration of the Arguss shares under the Exchange Act
would reduce the information that Arguss must furnish to its stockholders and to
the SEC and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the
short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b), the requirement of
furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholder meetings pursuant to
Section 14(a), and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to
stockholders, no longer applicable with respect to all Arguss shares. In
addition, if Arguss shares are no longer registered under the Exchange Act, the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to
"going-private" transactions would no longer be applicable to Arguss.
Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of Arguss and persons holding
"restricted securities" of Arguss to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act of 1933 may be impaired or eliminated. If
registration of the Arguss shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, they
would no longer be eligible for New York Stock Exchange listing or for continued
inclusion on the Federal Reserve Board's list of "margin securities."

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO ARGUSS

     Arguss engaged Allen & Company to act as its exclusive financial advisor in
connection with the offer and the merger. In connection with this engagement,
Arguss requested that Allen & Company evaluate the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Arguss shares of the consideration to be
received in the offer and the merger. On January 4, 2002, at a meeting of the
Arguss board held to consider the offer and the merger, in accordance with the
Arguss board's instructions, Allen & Company rendered an oral opinion, which
opinion was confirmed by delivery to the Arguss board of a written opinion dated
January 7, 2002, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
the matters described in its opinion, the consideration to be received was fair,
from a financial point of view, to holders of Arguss shares. James W. Quinn, a
member of the Arguss board, is also a Vice President and a director of Allen &
Company.

     The full text of Allen & Company's written opinion dated January 7, 2002,
which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is attached to this prospectus as Annex C. Allen & Company's
opinion is addressed to the Arguss board and relates only to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received as provided for
in the offer and the merger. The opinion does not address any other aspect of
the offer or the merger or any related transaction and does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Arguss shares as to whether such stockholder
should exchange Arguss shares in the offer or how such stockholder should vote
or act with respect to any matters relating to the offer or the merger. THE
SUMMARY OF ALLEN & COMPANY'S OPINION DESCRIBED BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION. YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO
READ THE OPINION, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX C, CAREFULLY IN
ITS ENTIRETY. In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company:

     - reviewed and analyzed a draft of the merger agreement and drafts of the
       agreements ancillary thereto;

     - reviewed and analyzed historical publicly available business information
       and financial results of Arguss and Dycom, including SEC filings of each
       of Arguss and Dycom;

     - reviewed and analyzed non-public operating and financial information of
       Arguss and Dycom provided by the managements of Arguss and Dycom;

     - reviewed and analyzed information regarding the past and current
       operations and financial conditions and the business prospects of Arguss
       and Dycom;

     - held discussions with senior executives of Arguss and Dycom relating to
       strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
       merger;

     - reviewed and analyzed historical market prices and trading volumes for
       the Arguss shares and the Dycom shares;

     - reviewed and analyzed projections as to the future operating and
       financial performance of Arguss as provided by the management of Arguss;

     - reviewed and analyzed financial and operating data for selected publicly
       traded companies Allen & Company deemed comparable to Arguss and Dycom;

     - reviewed and analyzed publicly available financial information relating
       to selected comparable merger and acquisition transactions;

     - reviewed and analyzed publicly available transaction information for
       selected comparable exchange offers and tender offers;

     - reviewed and analyzed research reports relating to each of Arguss and
       Dycom and companies that Allen & Company deemed comparable to Arguss and
       Dycom;

     - performed discounted cash flow analyses of Arguss, Dycom and a combined
       entity consisting of Arguss and Dycom;

     - reviewed and analyzed certain other information concerning the
       infrastructure services industry and the telecommunications industry;

     - considered possible strategic alternatives for Arguss; and

     - performed such other analyses and reviewed such other information as
       Allen & Company deemed appropriate, including trends prevailing in
       relevant industries and financial markets.

     In rendering its opinion, Allen & Company relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial and other information that Arguss, Dycom and their respective
employees, representatives and affiliates provided to, or discussed with, Allen
& Company. With respect to the financial projections provided to it, Allen &
Company assumed, at the direction of the management of Arguss, without
independent verification or investigation, that the

forecasts were reasonably prepared in good faith reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Arguss as to the future operating and
financial performance of Arguss. Allen & Company assumed, with Arguss' consent,
that the offer and the merger would be treated as an integrated transaction and
as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Allen & Company
also assumed, with Arguss' consent, that the offer and the merger would be
consummated in all material respects in accordance with their terms, without
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party
consents and approvals for the offer and the merger, no limitations,
restrictions or conditions would be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on Arguss, Dycom or the contemplated benefits of the offer and the
merger. Allen & Company relied, at the direction of the senior management of
Arguss and Dycom, without independent verification or investigation, upon the
assessments of the management of Dycom as to the anticipated financial and
operational benefits of the offer and the merger and the risks associated
therewith.

     Allen & Company did not (i) make or obtain any independent evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Arguss or
Dycom, (ii) perform due diligence on Arguss' or Dycom's physical properties and
facilities, sales, marketing or service organizations, or (iii) express any
opinion as to the underlying valuation, future performance or long-term
viability of Arguss or Dycom, the price at which Arguss shares would trade after
announcement or upon consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or the price at
which Dycom shares would trade at any time in the future. Allen & Company
expressed no view as to, and Allen & Company's opinion does not address, the
underlying business decision of Arguss to effect the offer or the merger, and
the opinion does not constitute a recommendation of the offer and the merger
over any alternative business strategy that may be available to Arguss. Allen &
Company's opinion was necessarily based on the information available to Allen &
Company and general economic, financial and stock market conditions and
circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by Allen & Company as of
the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, Allen & Company does not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. Arguss imposed no other instructions or limitations on
Allen & Company with respect to the investigations made or the procedures
followed by Allen & Company in rendering its opinion.

     This summary is not a complete description of Allen & Company's opinion to
the Arguss board or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by
Allen & Company in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Allen &
Company believes that its analyses and this summary must be considered as a
whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on
information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and
factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying Allen & Company's analyses and
opinion.

     In performing its analyses, Allen & Company considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond
the control of Arguss and Dycom. No company or business used in the analyses as
a comparison is identical to Arguss or Dycom, and an evaluation of the results
of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public
trading or other values of the companies or business segments analyzed.

     The estimates contained in Allen & Company's analysis and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating
to the value of businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, Allen & Company's analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the offer and the merger
was determined through negotiation between Arguss and Dycom and the decision to
enter into the offer and the merger was solely that of the Arguss board. Allen &
Company's opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the Arguss board in its evaluation of the offer and the merger and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Arguss board or
Arguss' management with respect to the offer and the merger or the consideration
to be received by the holders of Arguss shares as provided for in the offer and
the merger.

     Each of the analyses conducted by Allen & Company was carried out to
provide a different perspective on the offer and the merger and to enhance the
total mix of information. Allen & Company did not form a conclusion as to
whether any individual analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to
support an opinion as to the fairness to holders of Arguss shares, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration to be received. Allen & Company
did not place any specific reliance or weight on any individual analysis, but
instead concluded that its analyses, taken as a whole, supported its
determination.

     Selected Companies Analysis.  Allen & Company reviewed and compared certain
financial, operating and stock market information related to Arguss with
publicly held companies in the telecommunications infrastructure services
industry (the "Comparable Companies"), including Dycom, International Fibercom,
Inc., Mastec, Inc., Quanta Services, Inc. and Lexent, Inc.

     Allen & Company analyzed enterprise values, calculated as equity value,
plus debt, less cash, as a multiple of latest 12 months, or LTM, and of
estimated calendar year 2002 sales and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices on January 4, 2002. Estimated financial data for the Comparable
Companies was based on publicly available research analysts' estimates.
Estimated financial data for Arguss were based on (i) information received from
the senior management of Arguss ("Case A"), and (ii) publicly available research
analysts' estimates ("Case B"). This analysis indicated the following multiples:

                                                                       MULTIPLES     MULTIPLES

 * Case A
** Case B

     Based on the median multiples for the above ratios in Case A, this analysis
indicated an equity value range for Arguss shares between $3.01 and $10.11 per
share. Based on the median multiples for the above ratios in Case B, this
analysis indicated an equity value range for Arguss shares between $3.01 and
$5.48 per share. The equity value of Arguss shares at the agreed upon exchange
ratio of 0.3333 Dycom shares for each Arguss share (based on the Dycom share
price of $17.30 per share on January 4, 2002) is $5.77 per share, which is above
the equity value range according to the Comparable Companies in Case B and
within the equity value range according to the Comparable Companies in Case A.

     Mergers and Acquisitions by Comparable Companies Analysis. Using publicly
available information, Allen & Company reviewed and compared the purchase prices
(including net debt) and implied transaction value multiples paid in the
following ten selected transactions in the telecommunications

infrastructure industry, as well as other engineering service and infrastructure
transactions deemed appropriate by Allen & Company. The transactions were:

TARGET                                                      ACQUIROR
- ------                                                      --------

Niels Fugal Sons Company.........................  Dycom Industries, Inc.
U.S. Communications..............................  Arguss Communications, Inc.
UTILX Corporation................................  Infrastrux Group, Inc.
Able Telecom Holding.............................  Bracknell Corporation

     Allen & Company compared the transaction values implied by the purchase
prices in these selected transactions as multiples of LTM sales and EBITDA, and
operating earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT, as well as the equity
value of the purchase price (excluding net debt) multiple of net income. All
multiples were based on financial information available at the closing date of
the relevant transaction. The analysis indicated the following multiples:

                                                     LOW    HIGH   MEDIAN   MULTIPLES OF OFFER
                                                     ----   ----   ------   ------------------

Transaction Value as a Multiple of:
  LTM Revenues.....................................  0.44   1.92    0.78           0.70
  LTM EBITDA.......................................   4.6   11.1     8.2            6.8
  LTM EBIT.........................................   5.1   21.9    10.8             NM
Equity Value as a Multiple of:
  LTM Net Income...................................   6.8   28.5    15.2             NM

     Based on the range of multiples for LTM revenues and LTM EBITDA, this
analysis indicated an equity value range for Arguss shares between $1.76 and
$23.82 per share, with a median range for Arguss shares between $6.81 and $7.56
per share. The equity value of Arguss shares at the agreed upon exchange ratio
(based on the Dycom share price of $17.30 per share on January 4, 2002) is $5.77
per share, which is within the equity value range and below the medians
according to comparable mergers and acquisition transactions.

     Since LTM EBIT was only marginally positive and LTM Net Income was negative
for Arguss, a comparison based on these multiples was not meaningful.

     Transaction Premiums Analysis.  Allen & Company analyzed over 100 tender
offers and exchange offers involving target companies in industry sectors
including construction firms, electric, gas and water distribution firms, and
telecommunication service firms, from January 1999 to date. Allen & Company did
this analysis to determine premiums paid in these transactions over the
applicable stock price of the target company one day, one week and four weeks
prior to announcement of the acquisition offer. The premiums one day prior to
announcement averaged 25.5%; the premiums one week prior to announcement
averaged 30.2%; and the premiums four weeks prior to announcement averaged
38.3%. Based on closing stock prices on January 4, 2002, the premium one day
before the announcement of the offer and merger was 30.5%; the premium one week
before announcement was 47.7%; and the premium four weeks prior to announcement
was 64.8%.

     Based on the range of premiums, this analysis produced equity values of
Arguss shares ranging from $4.84 to $5.55 per share. The equity value of Arguss
shares at the agreed upon exchange ratio (based on the Dycom share price of
$17.30 per share on January 4, 2002) is $5.77 per share, which is above the
range of values according to the transaction premiums analysis.

     Historical Stock Price and Exchange Ratios.  Allen & Company compared the
ratio of the Arguss shares closing prices to the Dycom shares closing prices,
and the exchange ratio of 3:1 for the offer and the merger, for time periods
ranging from January 4, 2002, to two years prior to that date. The following
table summarizes the results of this analysis:

                                                         AVERAGE MARKET    MERGER EXCHANGE

     Based on the range of market exchange ratios, this analysis produced values
of Arguss shares ranging from $3.50 to $5.43 per share. The equity value of
Arguss shares at the agreed upon exchange ratio of 0.3333 Dycom shares for each
Arguss share (based on the Dycom share price of $17.30 per share on January 4,
2002) is $5.77 per share, which is above the range of values according to the
historical stock price and exchange ratios analysis.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Allen & Company performed a discounted cash
flow analysis on the projected financial information of Arguss and a combined
entity consisting of Arguss and Dycom on a pro forma basis (the "Combined
Entity") for the calendar years 2002 through 2006. This analysis was based upon
(i) operating and financial assumptions that were determined to be reasonable by
the managements of Arguss and Dycom, (ii) other information, including potential
synergies and financial benefits of the merger, provided to Allen & Company by
the managements of Dycom and Arguss, and (iii) research analyst estimates for
future financial performance of Dycom, as well as two cases for Arguss: (a)
using Arguss management's projections through 2003 in conjunction with research
analysts' projections for future periods ("Case A"); and (b) using research
analysts' projections ("Case B"). Using this information, Allen & Company
discounted to present value the projected stream of after-tax free cash flows
(net income plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures and
working capital changes). To estimate the residual value of Arguss and the
Combined Entity at the end of the forecast period (the "Terminal Value"), Allen
& Company applied a multiple of 5.2x to projected fiscal 2006 EBITDA. Allen &
Company used discount rates ranging from 15% to 25% for Arguss and 10% to 20%
for the Combined Entity.

     Based on these discount rates, Allen & Company calculated that the implied
equity value per share of Arguss shares ranges from $4.31 to $8.08 per share in
Case A and from $3.18 to $6.34 per share in Case B. Based on the agreed upon
exchange ratio and Case A, Allen & Company calculated that the implied equity
value per share of Arguss shares in the Combined Entity ranges from $6.05 per
share to $8.58 per share, resulting in a range of premiums above Arguss
stand-alone from 6.3% to 40.3%. Based on the agreed upon exchange ratio and Case
B, Allen & Company calculated that the implied equity value per share of Arguss
shares in the Combined Entity ranges from $5.91 per share to $8.35 per share,
resulting in a range of premiums above Arguss stand-alone from 31.8% to 85.5%.

     Pro Forma Accretion/(Dilution) Analysis.  Allen & Company reviewed and
analyzed the potential pro forma effect of the merger on the future earnings per
share, or EPS, of Dycom. For purposes of this analysis, Allen & Company analyzed
information from 2002 through 2006 based upon research analyst estimates for
future financial performance of Dycom, as well as two cases for Arguss: (a)
using Arguss management's projections through 2003 in conjunction with research
analysts' projections for later periods ("Case A"); and (b) using research
analysts' projections ("Case B"). Further, based on information received from
the senior management of Arguss and Dycom, Allen & Company assumed certain
synergies,

including cost savings and additional revenue growth potential from the Combined
Entity ranging from 0% to 2% in 2002 and 2% to 4% from 2003 to 2006. The
transaction was assumed to have closed on December 31, 2001 and the pro forma
analysis excluded any one-time charges. This analysis resulted in the following
impact on the future EPS of Dycom:

2004...................................................    38% to 57%           20% to 49%

2006...................................................    34% to 50%           20% to 45%

     The financial forecasts that underlie this analysis are subject to
substantial uncertainty, and accordingly, actual results may be substantially
different.

     Miscellaneous.  Arguss selected Allen & Company as its exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the offer and the merger based on Allen & Company's
reputation, expertise and familiarity with Arguss and its business. Allen &
Company is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of
its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
private placements and related financings, bankruptcy reorganizations and
similar recapitalizations, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated December 3, 2001, as supplemented
and amended on January 3, 2002, Allen & Company provided financial advisory
services and an opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to be received
by the stockholders of Arguss in connection with the offer and the merger. The
terms of this engagement include payment to Allen & Company of (i) a retainer
fee of $100,000, (ii) a fee upon successful completion of a transaction equal to
1% of the aggregate transaction value of the offer and the merger up to $100
million and 1.5% of any excess over $100 million of the aggregate transaction
value of the offer and the merger, and (iii) a fee for the fairness opinion of
$250,000. The retainer fee and $150,000 of the opinion fee are creditable
against the success fee. Arguss has also agreed to reimburse Allen & Company for
its expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, Arguss has agreed
to indemnify Allen & Company and its affiliates, controlling persons, officers,
agents and employees against certain liabilities and expenses, related to or
arising out of Allen & Company's engagements and any related transactions.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     Dycom will account for the merger as a "purchase," as this term is used
under generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred to as GAAP,
for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Therefore, the total merger
consideration paid by Dycom in connection with the merger, together with the
direct costs of the merger, will be allocated to Arguss' assets and liabilities
based on their fair market values, with any excess being treated as goodwill, or
an intangible asset. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, Dycom adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, which eliminates
amortization of goodwill and instead sets forth methods to periodically evaluate
goodwill for impairment.

     Dycom has prepared the unaudited pro forma financial information contained
in this prospectus using the purchase accounting method to account for the offer
and the merger. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements" beginning on page 68.

FEES AND EXPENSES

     Dycom has retained Merrill Lynch to act as dealer manager in connection
with the offer and to provide financial advisory services to Dycom in connection
with the offer and the merger. Merrill Lynch

will receive customary compensation for these services, a significant portion of
which is contingent upon the consummation of the offer and the merger, and will
be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable expenses of
counsel and other advisors. We have agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and
related persons against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with
their services, including certain liabilities and expenses under the federal
securities laws. Merrill Lynch is currently engaged by Dycom and has in the past
provided, and may in the future provide, financial advisory or financing
services to Dycom and has received, and may receive, fees for rendering these
services. In the ordinary course of Merrill Lynch's business, Merrill Lynch and
its affiliates may actively trade securities of Dycom and Arguss for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any
time hold a long or short position in these securities.

     We have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. as information
agent in connection with the offer. The information agent may contact holders of
Arguss shares by mail, telephone, telex, telegraph and personal interview and
may request brokers, dealers and other nominee stockholders to forward material
relating to the offer to beneficial owners of Arguss shares. We will pay the
information agent reasonable and customary compensation for these services in
addition to reimbursing the information agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. We have agreed to indemnify the information agent against certain
liabilities and expenses in connection with the offer, including certain
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

     In addition, we have retained First Union National Bank as the exchange
agent. We will pay the exchange agent reasonable and customary compensation for
its services in connection with the offer, will reimburse the exchange agent for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify the exchange agent
against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under
the U.S. federal securities laws.

     Except as set forth above, we will not pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of Arguss shares pursuant
to the offer. We will reimburse brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust
companies and other nominees, upon request, for customary clerical and mailing
expenses incurred by them in forwarding offering materials to their customers.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
"DY." We will make an application to list on the New York Stock Exchange the
Dycom shares that we will issue pursuant to the offer and the merger.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary description of the material provisions of the
merger agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this
prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. All Arguss stockholders are
urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it is the legal
document that governs the offer and the merger.

THE OFFER

     Terms of the Offer.  The merger agreement provides for the commencement by
Purchaser of this offer as soon as practicable after the initial public
announcement of the execution of the merger agreement. The obligation of
Purchaser and Dycom to exchange 0.3333 Dycom shares, subject to the limitations
described below, for each outstanding share of Arguss common stock that is
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn is subject to the satisfaction of
the minimum tender condition and certain other conditions that are described in
"The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page 39. The merger
agreement prohibits Purchaser from amending the offer to change the form of
consideration to be paid, decreasing the consideration payable per Arguss share
or the number of Arguss shares sought in the offer, imposing additional
conditions to the offer or making any other change which is adverse to the
holders of the Arguss shares.

     Mandatory Extensions to the Offer.  If a majority of the outstanding Arguss
shares on a fully diluted basis has not been tendered by the initial expiration
date, Purchaser must extend the offer on one or more occasions until a majority
of the Arguss shares has been tendered, except that Purchaser will not be
required to extend the offer for more than 15 business days after the initial
expiration date.

     Optional Extensions to the Offer.  Purchaser will have the right to extend
the offer (a) beyond the initial scheduled expiration date or any extension of
the expiration date if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the
offer, any of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived,
until the conditions to the offer are satisfied or waived, (b) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff applicable to the offer or any period required by applicable law or (c)
for an aggregate period of not more than ten business days beyond the latest
applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (a) or (b) above,
if, as of the expiration date, all of the conditions to the offer have been
satisfied or waived but the number of Arguss shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn equals more than 50%, but less than 90%, of the outstanding Arguss
shares on a fully diluted basis.

     Prompt Exchange of Arguss Shares After the Closing of the Offer.  Subject
to the conditions of the offer, Purchaser will accept for exchange and exchange,
as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the offer, all Arguss shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the offer.

THE MERGER

     Terms of the Merger.  The merger agreement provides that Purchaser will be
merged with and into Arguss as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement. Under
the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each
Arguss share not tendered in the offer will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive from Purchaser the same per share consideration received by
holders of Arguss shares who exchanged their Arguss shares in the offer and each
share of Purchaser common stock will be converted into and exchanged for one
share of common stock of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the merger consideration will not be payable in respect of Arguss
shares held by Arguss as treasury shares or by Dycom, Purchaser or any of
Dycom's or Purchaser's subsidiaries or by stockholders of Arguss who perfect
their appraisal rights, if any.

     Effective Time of the Merger.  The merger will become effective upon the
filing of a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such

later time as is agreed by Arguss and Dycom and specified in the certificate of
merger or certificate of ownership and merger. The filing of the certificate of
merger or certificate of ownership and merger will take place as soon as
practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described below under
"-- Conditions to the Merger."

     Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and Officers.  The
certificate of incorporation of Purchaser in effect at the effective time will
be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and as provided under Delaware law, except that the certificate of
incorporation will be amended to provide that the name of the surviving
corporation will be the name of Arguss. The by-laws of Purchaser in effect at
the effective time will be the by-laws of the surviving corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions of the by-laws, the
certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation and applicable
Delaware law.

     From and after the effective time and until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the surviving corporation's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the directors of Purchaser at the
effective time will be the directors of the surviving corporation and the
officers of Arguss at the effective time will be the officers of the surviving
corporation.

ARGUSS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Upon the acceptance for exchange of Arguss shares pursuant to the offer,
Dycom will be entitled to designate a number of directors (rounded up to the
next whole number) on Arguss' board of directors that equals the product of (a)
the total number of directors on Arguss' board of directors (giving effect to
the election of any additional directors pursuant to this provision) and (b) the
percentage that the number of shares beneficially owned by Dycom and Purchaser
(including Arguss shares accepted for exchange) bears to the total number of
outstanding Arguss shares. Arguss will take all action necessary to cause
Dycom's designees to be elected or appointed to the Arguss board of directors,
including increasing the number of directors and seeking and accepting
resignations of incumbent directors. At the same time, Arguss will use its best
efforts to cause individuals designated by Dycom to constitute the number of
members (rounded up to the next whole number) on each committee of Arguss' board
of directors as well as on each board of directors (and each committee thereof)
of each subsidiary of Arguss identified by Dycom that represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Arguss board, in each case, only
to the extent permitted by applicable law. Until the merger has become
effective, Arguss and Dycom will use their best efforts to cause Arguss' board
of directors to consist of at least two members who were directors of Arguss on
January 7, 2002. The merger agreement provides that, prior to the effective time
of the merger, the affirmative vote of a majority of those directors not
designated by Dycom will be required to:

     - terminate the merger agreement on behalf of Arguss,

     - amend the merger agreement when the amendment requires approval of
       Arguss' board of directors,

     - extend the time for performance of Dycom's or Purchaser's obligations
       under the merger agreement,

     - waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained in the merger
       agreement for the benefit of Arguss, or

     - approve any other action of Arguss which adversely affects the holders
       (other than Dycom or Purchaser) of Arguss shares.

TREATMENT OF ARGUSS STOCK OPTIONS

     The merger agreement provides that each outstanding option to purchase
Arguss shares, whether or not vested or exercisable, that is not exercised prior
to the effective time of the merger, will be converted into an option to
purchase that whole number of Dycom shares (rounded to the nearest whole share)

equal to the number of shares subject to the Arguss stock option immediately
prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.3333, the exchange ratio in the
offer, at a price per Dycom share (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the option price per share subject to such Arguss stock option in effect
immediately prior to the effective time divided by the exchange ratio. Each
Arguss stock option converted into a Dycom stock option will be exercisable upon
the same terms and conditions as those under the applicable Arguss stock option
plan.

     Dycom will, at or prior to the effective time, reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Dycom shares for delivery upon exercise of the options to
purchase Dycom shares and agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8
relating to such options and shares with the SEC.

COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Access to Information.  Until the effective time of the merger, each of
Arguss and Dycom and each of their respective subsidiaries will, upon prior
notice, afford the other and its representatives access at reasonable times to
its and its subsidiaries' employees, properties, books and records in order that
Arguss or Dycom may have an opportunity to make reasonable investigations.

     Conduct of Business of Arguss Pending Merger.  The merger agreement
obligates Arguss and its subsidiaries, among other things, until the effective
time of the merger, unless Dycom otherwise consents, to conduct their business
in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past
practice. The merger agreement also expressly restricts the ability of Arguss to
engage in certain material transactions, such as certain purchases and sales of
assets or the sale or redemption of outstanding securities of Arguss, without
the prior written consent of Dycom.

     Conduct of Business of Dycom Pending Merger.  The merger agreement
obligates Dycom, until the effective time of the merger, not to take any action,
without the consent of Arguss, which would cause its representations and
warranties to be untrue in any material respect. The merger agreement also
expressly restricts the ability of Dycom to take any action that would
reasonably be likely to materially delay the consummation of the offer or the
merger.

     No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions.  The merger agreement provides
that, except in the circumstances described below, Arguss will not and will
instruct its representatives not to directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any competing transaction (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or
continue discussions or negotiate with any person or entity in furtherance of
such inquiries or to obtain a competing transaction, or agree to or endorse any
competing transaction, or authorize or permit any of its representatives to take
such action.

     However, the merger agreement provides that the Arguss board of directors
may furnish information to, enter into discussion or negotiations with, and
maintain or continue such discussions or negotiations with, a person who has
made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding a competing
transaction if the Arguss board has (a) determined, in its good faith judgment
(after advice from its financial advisor), that such proposal or offer is
reasonably likely to constitute a superior proposal (as defined below), (b)
determined, in its good faith judgment after consultation with independent legal
counsel, that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (c) provided written notice to Dycom
of its intent to furnish information or to hold discussions or negotiations with
such person at least two business days prior to taking any such action.

     Obligation to Recommend the Offer and the Merger.  The merger agreement
provides that, unless the Arguss board of directors otherwise determines (based
upon a majority vote thereof in its good faith judgment) that such other action
is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duty to stockholders under applicable
law after receiving advice from outside legal counsel, prior to approval by the
stockholders of Arguss, (a) the Arguss board of directors will recommend
approval of the merger agreement by Arguss' stockholders, (b) neither the Arguss
board of directors nor any of its committees will amend, modify or withdraw such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Dycom or take any action or make any
statement

inconsistent with such recommendation and (c) Arguss will take all lawful action
reasonably necessary to secure any required Arguss stockholder approval of the
merger agreement. In the event that the Arguss board has recommended that Arguss
stockholders approve the merger agreement but, before approval by the Arguss
stockholders, subsequently determines (based on a majority vote of the Arguss
board) in good faith that some other action is necessary to comply with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law after receiving advice
from outside counsel, Dycom and Purchaser will cooperate with Arguss in making
modifications to the disclosure regarding the Arguss board's recommendation in
the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the stockholder vote to accurately
reflect that determination. The merger agreement also provides that prior to the
closing of the offer Arguss may take any of such actions in connection with the
termination of the merger agreement as described below under "-- Termination of
the Merger Agreement -- Termination by Arguss" if a third party makes a superior
proposal.

     "Competing transaction" means any of the following transactions (except to
the extent the transaction involves Conceptronic, Arguss' wholly owned
subsidiary): (a) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving Arguss or any material subsidiaries, (b) any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of Arguss or any material subsidiaries, (c) any sale, exchange, transfer
or other disposition of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Arguss
or any material subsidiaries, (d) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of Arguss or any material subsidiaries, (e) any
solicitation in opposition to approval and adoption of the merger agreement by
the Arguss stockholders, or (f) any other transaction the consummation of which
would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the
stockholders' agreement.

     "Superior proposal" means an unsolicited written bona fide offer made by a
third party to consummate any of the following transactions: (a) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction
involving Arguss pursuant to which the stockholders of Arguss immediately
preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interest in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (b) any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or a substantial part of the
assets of Arguss, (c) the acquisition by any person or group, directly or
indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock of
Arguss or (d) any substantially equivalent transaction, on terms that the Arguss
board determines, in its good faith judgment (after having received the advice
of a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation), to be more
favorable to Arguss stockholders than the merger, is reasonably capable of being
consummated and for which financing, to the extent required, is likely to be
obtained on a timely basis.

     Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.  Dycom and Arguss will promptly
after the execution of the merger agreement (a) make their respective filings,
and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions and (b) use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions, including, without limitation,
using their reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of governmental authorities and
parties to contracts with Arguss and its subsidiaries as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the merger.
However, neither Purchaser nor Dycom will be required to take any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other
arrangements, that (1) requires the divestiture of any assets of any of
Purchaser, Dycom, Arguss or any of their respective subsidiaries or (2) limits
Dycom's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, Arguss and
its subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Dycom's or its affiliates'
other assets or businesses. In case, at any time after the effective time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of the merger
agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to the merger
agreement will use their reasonable best efforts to take all such action.

     Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.  See "Interests of
Certain Persons" beginning on page 63.

     Employee Benefits.  The merger agreement provides that, from and after the
effective time, Dycom will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries
to honor, in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements,
arrangements, policies, plans and commitments as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of Arguss or any of its subsidiaries. Employees of Arguss and its
subsidiaries will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement established or maintained by the surviving corporation or any of
its subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the effective
time with Arguss or its subsidiaries. However, the crediting of service may not
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any benefit. In addition, Dycom will
waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any
pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable plan of Dycom or its subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of Arguss and its
subsidiaries in the calendar year in which the effective time occurs.

     Representations and Warranties.  The merger agreement contains a number of
customary representations and warranties relating to each of the parties and
their ability to consummate the offer and the merger. Among others, Arguss makes
representations and warranties to Dycom and Purchaser regarding:

     - organization and qualification to do business;

     - subsidiaries;

securities of Arguss or of the consolidated assets of Arguss and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any such transaction that, taken as a whole,
if it had been proposed prior to the termination of the merger agreement, would

transaction.

"-- Termination by Dycom" and a proposal or offer for a competing transaction
has been made and publicly announced or communicated to Arguss' stockholders

termination, and concurrently with or within twelve months of the date of such
termination a third party acquisition event occurs, then Arguss is required to

                          THE STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary description of the material provisions of the
stockholders' agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the complete text of the stockholders' agreement, which is attached as Annex
B to this prospectus and incorporated by reference into this prospectus. All
Arguss stockholders are urged to read the stockholders' agreement in its
entirety.

     Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, in order to induce
Dycom to enter into the merger agreement, the current directors and certain
executive officers of Arguss entered into a stockholders' agreement with Dycom,
Purchaser and Arguss.

     Covenants.  The stockholders' agreement provides, among other things, that
all of the persons that are subject to the terms of the stockholders' agreement
will:

     - tender all of their outstanding Arguss shares into the offer promptly
       after commencement of the offer and will not withdraw such shares from
       the offer;

     - vote all of their outstanding Arguss shares at any meeting of Arguss
       stockholders and in any action by written consent in favor of the merger
       agreement and any other matter that could reasonably be expected to
       facilitate the consummation of the merger and any other transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement;

     - vote all of their outstanding Arguss shares at any meeting of Arguss
       stockholders and in any action by written consent against any competing
       transaction or any merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
       recapitalization or other business combination or any other action or
       agreement that could reasonably be expected to cause Arguss not to be
       able to meet the conditions to the merger or fulfill its obligations
       under the merger agreement;

     - grant an irrevocable proxy to Dycom to vote all of their Arguss shares at
       any meeting of Arguss stockholders and in any action by written consent,
       allowing Dycom to vote to approve the merger agreement and any other
       matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the consummation
       of the merger and any other transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement and against any competing transaction;

     - covenant that all written information relating to such stockholder, and
       such stockholder's affiliates, provided by or on behalf of such
       stockholder for inclusion in this prospectus or any other document that
       is filed with the SEC in connection with the offer and the merger will
       not contain any untrue statements of material fact or omit to state a
       material fact;

     - agree to not, directly or indirectly, sell, assign, transfer (including
       by operation of law), pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any Arguss
       shares, grant a proxy or enter into a voting agreement inconsistent with
       the stockholders' agreement with respect to Arguss shares, enter into any
       contract with respect to the disposition of any Arguss shares or take any
       action that would make any representation or warranty of such stockholder
       materially untrue or incorrect or that would prevent the stockholder from
       performing his obligations under the stockholders' agreement unless the
       merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms;

     - not instruct his representatives, which include officers, directors,
       employees, subsidiaries, agents, investment bankers, attorneys,
       accountants or any other representatives, to solicit, initiate or
       encourage (which includes furnishing nonpublic information) or take any
       other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
       offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
       competing transaction unless required by such stockholder's fiduciary
       duties as directors or executive officers of Arguss;

     - not enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any
       person or entity that makes inquiries regarding a competing transaction
       or to obtain a competing transaction, unless required by such
       stockholders' fiduciary duties as a director or executive officer of
       Arguss;

     - not endorse any competing transaction unless required by such
       stockholder's fiduciary duties as a director or executive officer of
       Arguss; and

     - promptly notify Dycom if any person makes a proposal or inquiry or
       contacts the stockholder relating to a competing transaction.

     Dycom agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to have declared effective
a "shelf" registration statement that registers the resale by all of the Arguss
directors and/or officers subject to the stockholders' agreement (and any other
Arguss stockholder agreed to by Dycom), on a continuous basis for a six-month
period, of all the Dycom shares received by such persons pursuant to the offer
and the merger, including any securities issued as a dividend or distribution on
such shares. As promptly as reasonably practicable, Dycom and each director
and/or officer subject to the stockholders' agreement will enter into a
registration rights agreement providing for the foregoing and containing other
customary provisions.

     Representations and Warranties.  The stockholders' agreement contains a
number of customary representations of the stockholders relating to each
stockholder's ability to enter into the stockholders' agreement and the
ownership of each stockholder's Arguss shares, including:

     - authorization,

     - no conflict and required filings and consents,

     - litigation, and

     - ownership of shares.

     Termination.  The obligations of the stockholders under the stockholders'
agreement terminate upon the earlier of the effective date of the merger or 12
months following the termination of the merger agreement.

     On January 7, 2002, the stockholders subject to the stockholders' agreement
owned (either beneficially or of record) 972,839 Arguss shares, constituting
approximately 6.7% of the outstanding shares of Arguss as of January 22, 2002
(or approximately 5.4% of the outstanding shares of Arguss on a fully diluted
basis).

                          INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS

     Some directors and executive officers of Arguss may have interests in the
offer and the merger that are different from or in addition to your interests.
Information about these interests is more fully set forth in Arguss'
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, including the
Information Statement attached as Annex A to the Schedule 14D-9, dated January
23, 2002, which is being mailed to Arguss stockholders with this preliminary
prospectus and which is incorporated into this prospectus by reference. Each
material agreement, arrangement or understanding and any actual or potential
conflict of interest between Arguss or its affiliates and Arguss, its executive
officers, directors or affiliates, or between Arguss or its affiliates and Dycom
or Purchaser or their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates, is
incorporated into this prospectus by reference as a result of the previous
sentence.

     Furthermore, except as outlined in this prospectus, neither we nor, to the
best of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other
affiliates has any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any
other person with respect to any securities of Arguss, including, but not
limited to, any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning
the transfer or the voting of any such securities, joint ventures, loan or
option arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss
or the giving or withholding of proxies. Except as described in this prospectus,
there have been no contacts, negotiations or transactions since January 1, 1999,
between us or, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive
officers or other affiliates on the one hand, and Arguss or its affiliates, on
the other hand, concerning a merger, consolidation or acquisition, a tender
offer or other acquisition of securities, an election of directors, or a sale or
other transfer of a material amount of assets. Neither we, nor, to the best of
our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has
since January 1, 1999 had any transaction with Arguss or any of its executive
officers, directors or affiliates that would require disclosure under the rules
and regulations of the SEC applicable to the offer.

     Except as described in this prospectus, neither we nor, to the best of our
knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates
beneficially owns or has any right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any
Arguss shares and neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our
directors, executive officers or other affiliates, has effected any transaction
in the Arguss shares during the past 60 days.

     During each of our current fiscal year and our last fiscal year, Joseph M.
Schell, one of our directors, was employed as the Chairman of Global Technology,
Investment Banking, of Merrill Lynch & Co., one of our financial advisors in
connection with the merger. Mr. Schell resigned his position with Merrill Lynch,
effective as of November 30, 2001. However, pursuant to the terms of his
employment agreement with Merrill Lynch, Mr. Schell may continue to be
considered an employee of Merrill Lynch until February 22, 2002. During our last
fiscal year, Merrill Lynch was engaged as one of our financial advisors in
connection with other matters, including the adoption of our shareholders'
rights plan. During the current fiscal year, we may engage Merrill Lynch as one
of our financial advisors to perform services in addition to those performed in
connection with the offer and the merger.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS

     On November 7, 2001, Arguss entered into written employment agreements with
each of: Rainer H. Bosselmann, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Arguss; H. Haywood Miller III, Executive Vice President and Secretary
of Arguss; and Arthur F. Trudel, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer of Arguss. Messrs. Bosselmann, Trudel and Miller did not have
employment agreements with Arguss prior to November 7, 2001. The employment
agreements provide for an initial term of one year, beginning on November 1,
2001 and ending on November 1, 2002, and will be renewed automatically for
additional one-year terms upon expiration of the initial term, unless either
party to an employment agreement provides written notice to the other party of
that party's intention not to renew the employment agreement at least 90 days
prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Under these agreements, Mr.
Bosselmann will be paid an annual salary of $180,000 and each of Messrs. Miller
and Trudel will receive annual salaries of $150,000, which are the same salaries
they were being paid

immediately prior to the execution of these agreements. Bonuses are payable in
the reasonable discretion of the Arguss board of directors subject to the
satisfaction of reasonable performance criteria.

     The employment agreements also provide for payments to each of Messrs.
Bosselmann, Miller and Trudel in the event of a change in control of Arguss.
Under the terms of the employment agreements, a change in control will occur
upon consummation of the offer. If Messrs. Bosselmann, Miller and Trudel do not
agree to separate employment agreements with Arguss within 90 days following a
change in control, each is entitled to receive a lump-sum payment, in an amount
equal to two times his annual salary at the time the change in control occurs,
to be paid within the greater of 30 days after the change in control or ten days
after notification to Arguss of the intention to decline further employment with
Arguss. Each of Messrs. Bosselmann, Miller and Trudel is also entitled to the
continuation of all benefits, including executive fringe benefits, medical and
health coverage, and life insurance and long term disability coverage, for a
period of 12 months from the date of the change in control.

ARGUSS STOCK OPTIONS

     Arguss established a stock option plan in July 1991 pursuant to which the
board of directors of Arguss may grant stock options to officers and key
employees. The plan, as amended, authorizes the grant of options to purchase up
to 5,000,000 shares of Arguss common stock. Stock options granted under the plan
may be "incentive stock options", or ISOs, or "non-qualified stock options", or
NSOs. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Arguss, while NSOs may be issued
to non-employee directors, consultants and others, as well as to employees of
Arguss.

     At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each option to
purchase Arguss shares whether or not vested or exercisable, that has not been
exercised prior to the effective time will, by virtue of the merger and without
any further action on the part of the holder, be assumed by Dycom and deemed to
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions applicable to
Arguss' options, the same number of Dycom shares as the holder of Arguss'
options would have been entitled to receive under the merger agreement had such
options to purchase Arguss shares been exercised in full immediately prior to
the effective time (rounded to the nearest whole number), at a price per share
(rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the aggregate exercise
price for the Arguss shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to any options
granted by Arguss divided by (2) the number of whole Dycom shares purchasable
pursuant to each option to purchase Dycom shares in accordance with the
foregoing. The other terms of Arguss' stock options, and the plan, will continue
to apply in accordance with their terms. As of January 22, 2002, there were
options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 3,426,767 Arguss shares.

     In the event of a sale or acquisition of substantially all of Arguss' stock
or assets, Arguss must give 30 days notice of the proposed transaction to all
holders of NSOs so that such holders may exercise up to 100% of their options
before the transaction takes place. In addition, in connection with the offer
and the merger, the Arguss board has accelerated, effective upon the date Dycom
accepts the Arguss shares tendered for exchange, NSOs to purchase 50,000 Arguss
shares granted in the year ended December 31, 2001 to each of Messrs.
Bosselmann, Miller and Trudel, executive officers of Arguss. Therefore, upon
Dycom accepting for exchange the Arguss shares tendered pursuant to the offer,
otherwise unvested and unexercisable NSOs granted to Messrs. Bosselmann, Miller
and Trudel will become exercisable and, upon the effectiveness of the merger,
will become options to purchase Dycom shares. Except as specifically approved by
the Arguss board of directors with respect to ISOs to purchase an aggregate of
15,000 Arguss shares held by two employees who are not executive officers, the
vesting of ISOs granted by Arguss under the plan will not accelerate as a result
of the merger.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation of the merger will contain provisions with respect to
indemnification that are no less favorable than those set forth in Arguss'
certificate of incorporation and bylaws on January 7, 2002. These provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the effective time in any manner

that would adversely affect the rights of individuals who were directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of Arguss at or prior to the
effective time, unless the modification is required by law. From and after the
effective time, Dycom will, and will cause the surviving corporation to, fulfill
and honor Arguss' obligations under any indemnification agreements that Arguss
has with its directors and officers as of the effective time and any
indemnification provisions under Arguss' certificate of incorporation and bylaws
as in effect on January 7, 2002.

     The surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
in effect for six years from the effective time, the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by Arguss with respect to
matters occurring prior to the effective time, unless Dycom, in its sole
discretion, includes the current directors and officers of Arguss under its
existing directors and officers liability insurance policies for not less than
six years from the effective time or causes the surviving corporation to
substitute liability insurance policies of at least the same coverage and
containing terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable than the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
Arguss. However, in no event will the surviving corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for this coverage in excess of 225% of the current
annual premiums paid by Arguss for its insurance. We have been advised by Arguss
that its current annual premiums are approximately $113,166.

               COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICES AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION

     On January 4, 2002, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
execution of the merger agreement and of our intention to commence the offer,
the closing price of Arguss common stock was $4.42 per share and the closing
price of Dycom common stock was $17.30 per share. On January 22, 2002, the last
full trading day prior to the printing of this prospectus, the closing price of
Arguss shares was $4.93 per share and the closing price of Dycom shares was
$15.02 per share.

     The market prices of Arguss shares and Dycom shares are subject to
fluctuation. As a result, Arguss and Dycom shareholders are urged to obtain
current market quotations.

     According to Arguss, on January 22, 2002, there were approximately
14,519,944 Arguss shares outstanding, held by 111 holders of record.

     As of January 22, 2002, approximately 42,926,666 Dycom shares were
outstanding (not including 81,700 Dycom treasury shares held by Deutsche Bank),
held by 670 holders of record.

DYCOM DIVIDEND POLICY

     The holders of Dycom shares have not received cash dividends since 1982.
Our dividend policy after completion of the merger will depend upon our board's
consideration of business conditions, operating results, capital and reserve
requirements and other relevant factors; however we expect to continue not to
pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

ARGUSS DIVIDEND POLICY

     Arguss has never paid dividends to its stockholders.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
present the effect of the pending acquisition of Arguss by Dycom, which is to be
accounted for as a purchase. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance
sheet presents the combined financial position of Dycom and Arguss as of October
27, 2001 assuming that the acquisition had occurred as of that date. Such pro
forma information is based upon the historical consolidated balance sheet data
of Dycom as of October 27, 2001 and Arguss as of September 30, 2001. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year
ended July 28, 2001 and three month period ended October 27, 2001 give effect to
the acquisition of Arguss by Dycom as if such acquisition had occurred on July
30, 2000, the first day of Dycom's fiscal year 2001. Pro forma operations for
the year-end and three-month periods for Dycom consist of its results of
operations for the year ended July 28, 2001 and three months ended October 27,
2001, respectively. Pro forma operations for the twelve-month and three-month
periods for Arguss consist of its results of operations for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2001 and three months ended September 30, 2001, respectively. The
use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has different fiscal
year ends.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based
on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements. The
pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of
developing such pro forma statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements are not necessarily an indication of the results that would
have been achieved had the transaction been consummated as of the dates
indicated or that may be achieved in the future.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     On January 7, 2002, Dycom entered into the merger agreement to acquire all
the outstanding Arguss shares. The acquisition of Arguss is to be accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price will be
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date. As
of January 18, 2002, there were 14,519,944 Arguss shares outstanding and
3,426,767 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants.
Based on this and the exchange ratio of 0.3333 Dycom shares for each Arguss
share, Arguss' stockholders will receive a total of 4,839,497 Dycom shares and
holders of Arguss options will have the right to receive 1,142,141 Dycom shares.
The purchase price of the Arguss acquisition is approximately $89.5 million,
including the value of the Dycom shares to be issued for Arguss shares, the
estimated value of the Arguss options (reduced by the intrinsic value component
of the unvested options, which is recorded as deferred compensation) and
estimated transaction costs. These estimates are preliminary and the actual
number of Dycom shares issued will depend on the actual number of Arguss shares
outstanding as of the date of consummation of the merger. The fair value of the
Dycom shares used in determining the purchase price was $17.26 per share, based
on the average closing market price of Dycom's shares for the five trading days
ended on January 9, 2002. The fair value of Arguss common stock options to be
assumed was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted assumptions: risk free return from 1.72% to 5.09%, expected
life equal to the lesser of the remaining term of the option grant or six years,
expected dividend rate of 0% and volatility of 42.5% for months one through six,
37% for month seven through year five and 32% for over five years. Estimated
direct transaction costs of Dycom consist primarily of fees for investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, SEC filing fees, and printing.

     The purchase consideration is estimated as follows (in thousands):

Dycom common stock to be issued.............................  $83,530
Assumption of Arguss' options...............................    2,488
Estimated transaction costs of Dycom........................    3,436

                                                              =======

     The allocation of the purchase price as of October 27, 2001 is summarized
below (in thousands):

ASSETS
Cash and marketable securities..............................  $  4,340
Accounts receivable.........................................    45,174

     Total liabilities.............................................................     103,571
                                                                                     ----------
Net assets acquired................................................................  $   89,454

     The above purchase price allocation is preliminary. The final determination
of the allocation of purchase price will be determined based on the fair value
of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed as of the date that
the acquisition is consummated. At this time no intangible assets have been
identified which would be valued apart from goodwill. The purchase price
allocation will remain preliminary until Dycom is able to (a) complete a third
party valuation of property, plant and equipment acquired, (b) conduct a
detailed review of the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities of Arguss,
and (c) evaluate the fair value of other assets, including intangibles and
liabilities acquired. The final determination of the purchase price is expected
to be completed shortly after the consummation of the merger. The actual amounts
allocated to assets and liabilities could differ significantly from the amounts
presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

NOTE 2 -- PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS:

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following adjustments are reflected in the pro forma condensed combined
statements of operations to reflect the estimated impact of the merger on the
historical combined results of Dycom and Arguss. No adjustment has been made to
Arguss' historical interest expense as no decision has been reached regarding
the future refinancing of Arguss' debt.

     (a) To eliminate revenue and cost of sales for transactions between Dycom
         and Arguss.

     (b) To remove amortization of historical goodwill previously reported by
         Arguss.

     (c) To adjust historical income tax expense for the impact of certain
         pro-forma adjustments. This adjustment was calculated based on an
         estimated statutory tax rate of 40%.

     (d) Pro forma basic and diluted earnings per common share are computed by
         dividing the pro forma net income attributable to common shareholders
         by the pro forma weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
         Potentially dilutive securities are not taken into account when their
         effects would be anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of shares used to
         compute historical basic and diluted earnings per common share to
         shares used to compute pro forma basic and diluted earnings per common
         share is as follows:

              UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET

     The following adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet reflect the estimated impact of events that are directly
attributable to the merger of Dycom and Arguss.

     (a)  To adjust the value of assets held for sale.

     (b)  To eliminate accounts receivable and accounts payable balances between
          Dycom and Arguss.

     (c)  To record current and deferred taxes attributable to the tax effect of
          pro forma adjustments.

     (d)  To adjust certain tangible assets to their estimated fair market
          value.

     (e)  To eliminate Arguss' historical goodwill, as the unaudited pro forma
          condensed combined balance sheet, which assumes the merger of Dycom
          and Arguss had taken place October 27, 2001, should reflect the
          re-valued goodwill and identifiable intangible assets resulting from
          the acquisition of Arguss by Dycom.

     (f)  To record goodwill arising from the transaction.

     (g)  To record the liability for Arguss' estimated transaction costs of
          $3.7 million consisting primarily of fees for investment bankers,
          attorneys, and accountants.

     (h)  To record severance payments of $1.1 million to be paid immediately
          prior to or on the effective date of the merger pursuant to certain
          Arguss employment agreements.

     (i)  To eliminate Arguss' historical common stock, additional
          paid-in-capital and retained earnings.

     (j)  To record the issuance of Dycom common stock, and the assumption of
          options as part of the purchase price.

     (k)  To record Dycom's estimated transaction costs of $3.4 million,
          consisting primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys,
          accountants, SEC filing fees, and printing.

     (l)  To record the deferred compensation associated with the purchase of
          Arguss. Deferred compensation represents a portion of the estimated
          intrinsic value of unvested Argus stock options assumed by Dycom in
          the merger to the extent that service is required after the closing
          date of the merger. No adjustment has been made to the pro forma
          results of operations as the calculated amount of $117,000 is deemed
          to be immaterial.

     (m) To eliminate Arguss' historical common stock subscribed.

     (n)  To eliminate Arguss' historical accumulated comprehensive loss.

                                   THE OFFER

     SECTION 2.01  The Offer.  (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article IX and provided that none of the
events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have occurred or be continuing, unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company, as soon as practicable after the
public announcement of the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to commence the Offer to exchange all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock for the right to receive from Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer 0.3333 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock for each
share of Company Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). The Offer shall be subject
only to (1) the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration of the Offer, and not
withdrawn, at least a number of shares of Company Common Stock that represents a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a Fully Diluted
Basis (the "Minimum Condition") and (2) the other conditions set forth in Annex
I hereto. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions
to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
provided that no change may be made that changes the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, decreases the consideration payable in the Offer, reduces
the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased in the
Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I
or makes any other change which is adverse to the

                                       A-9

holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to
Section 10.01(d), without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall have the
right to extend the Offer (i) beyond the scheduled expiration date, which shall
initially be 20 business days following the commencement of the Offer (the
"Initial Expiration Date"), if, at the Initial Expiration Date or any extension
thereof, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or
waived, until such conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable law
or (iii) for an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days beyond the
latest applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or
(ii) of this sentence, if, as of such date, all of the conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied or waived, but the number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer equals more than 50%,
but less than 90%, of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a Fully
Diluted Basis. In the event that Merger Sub is unable to consummate the Offer on
the Initial Expiration Date due to the failure of the Minimum Condition to be
satisfied, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article X, extend the Offer on one or more occasions and set
subsequent scheduled expiration dates until the Minimum Condition has been
satisfied; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require Parent
to cause Merger Sub to extend the Offer for more than, in the aggregate, 15
business days after the Initial Expiration Date. Subject to the foregoing and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable after
the expiration of the Offer, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the SEC (i)
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") relating to the Offer and (ii) a
registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Offer Registration Statement"). The
Offer Registration Statement will include a prospectus containing the
information required under Rule 14d-4(b) under the Exchange Act (together, the
Schedule TO, the Offer Registration Statement and such documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments
and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Each of the Company and Parent
shall use their reasonable efforts to have the Offer Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the
filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the Offer Registration Statement
effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and to supplement the Offer
Documents to include any information that shall become necessary to include in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Registration
Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents
as so corrected to be, at such time as reasonably agreed by Parent and the
Company, disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent and Merger
Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide
the Company and its counsel an opportunity to participate in the response of
Parent or Merger Sub to such comments.

     SECTION 2.02  Company Action.  (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents that the Company Board, at a meeting duly
called and held, has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Stockholders'
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement,
the Stockholders' Agreement and the
                                       A-10

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, including, without limitation, Section 203
thereof, and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval
and adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders. The Company
further represents that Allen & Company Incorporated ("Advisor") has delivered
to the Company Board its written opinion as of the date hereof that the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial point
of view to such holders. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company Board and the Company shall
not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to the Parent
or Merger Sub, unless the Company Board otherwise determines (based on a
majority vote of the Company Board in its good faith judgment) that such
withdrawal or modification is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable law after receiving advice from outside counsel
(who may be the Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel).

     (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC as soon as practicable
on the day that the Offer is commenced and disseminate to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") that, subject to Section 8.04, shall reflect the recommendations of the
Company Board referred to in Section 2.02(a) above. Parent and its counsel shall
be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its
being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments
that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and
shall provide Parent and its counsel with an opportunity to participate in the
response of the Company to such comments. Each of the Company and Parent agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to supplement the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information
that shall become necessary to include in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be, at such time as reasonably agreed
by Parent and the Company, disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.

     (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and with security position listings of shares of Company Common
Stock held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all
other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and
security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of shares of
Company Common Stock as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall
promptly furnish Parent with such additional information, including, without
limitation, updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels
and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as Parent may
reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent shall hold in
confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall
use such information only in connection with the Transactions, and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, shall deliver to
the Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

     SECTION 2.03  Directors.  (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of
any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be
entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section 2.03) and (ii) the percentage that the number
of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub
(including shares of Company Common Stock

                                       A-11

accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause
Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, the Company will also use its best efforts to
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members,
rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company Board
and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company identified by
Parent (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Company Board, in each case only to the extent
permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
2.03, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that
at least two of the members of the Company Board shall, at all times prior to
the Effective Time, be directors of the Company who were directors of the
Company on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors"); provided that if there
shall be in office fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason, the
Company Board shall cause a person designated by the remaining Continuing
Director to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain,
the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to
fill such vacancies who will not be officers or employees or affiliates of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement.

     (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis in writing and be solely responsible
for any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their respective
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.

     (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company Board, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company and
any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub) in any respect.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 3.01  The Merger.  At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

     SECTION 3.02  Effective Time; Closing.  As promptly as practicable after
the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article IX, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the Certificate of
Merger (or such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time"). Immediately
prior to such filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall be held at the offices of Shearman & Sterling, 599 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10022, or such other place as the parties shall
agree, for the

                                       A-12

purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the
conditions set forth in Article IX.

     SECTION 3.03  Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 3.04  Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws.  (a) At the Effective
Time and subject to Section 8.06(a) hereof, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; provided,
however, that, at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is Arguss Communications, Inc.".

     (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to Section 8.06(a) hereof, at the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws.

     SECTION 3.05  Directors and Officers.  At the Effective Time, the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each such director to hold office in
accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, subject to the applicable provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or approval.

                                   ARTICLE IV

               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     SECTION 4.01  Conversion of Securities.  At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Except as provided in clause
     (b) of this Section 4.01, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall
     be canceled in exchange for the right to receive from Parent the same
     number of shares of Parent Common Stock as exchanged for each share of
     Company Common Stock in the Offer. At the Effective Time, all Company
     Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired
     and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") that
     formerly represented such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter
     represent only the right to receive the number of whole shares of Parent
     Common Stock into which the Company Common Stock represented by such
     Certificate is converted pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) and the right, if
     any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.02(e) cash in lieu of a fractional
     share of Parent Common Stock and any dividend or distribution pursuant to
     Section 4.02(c), in each case without interest.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Parent and
     Merger Sub. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as
     treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
     Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
     Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
     Merger, and

                                       A-13

     without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be
     outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
     consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

          (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value
     $.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
     one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
     value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 4.02  Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that may
be designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article IV through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 4.01 as of the Effective Time, and cash, from time to time as required
to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.02(e)
(such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the shares of Parent Common Stock contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 4.01 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated
by Section 4.02(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was,
at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.01(a): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to
such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking into account all
Company Common Stock then held by such holder), cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(c) may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
4.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(c).

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock.  No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 4.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the Certificates
                                       A-14

representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (d) No Further Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 4.02(c) or (e))
shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

     (e) No Fractional Shares.  No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder
of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share
interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
average of the per share closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
of shares of Parent Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days ending
on (and including) the third trading day immediately preceding the date of the
Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms of Sections 4.02(b) and (c).

     (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

     (g) Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 4.02(c). Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity) shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

     (h) No Liability.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any such Company Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     (i) Withholding Rights.  Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, such withheld
                                       A-15

amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

     (j) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 4.02(c).

     SECTION 4.03  Stock Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates properly presented to the Exchange
Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 4.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 4.02(c).

     SECTION 4.04  Company Stock Options.  (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether or not vested or exercisable,
that is not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed by
Parent and deemed to constitute an option (each, a "Parent Option") to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option (subject to Section 3.04(b)), the same number of shares of Parent Common
Stock as the holder of such Company Stock Option would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 4.01 of this Agreement had such holder exercised
such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time
(rounded to the nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option
divided by (y) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Parent Option in accordance with the foregoing. The other terms
of each such Company Stock Option, and the Company Stock Option Plan, shall
continue to apply in accordance with their terms.

     (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Parent Options. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement
on Form S-8, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Parent Options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent
Options remaining outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent
to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, Parent shall administer the Company Stock Option Plan in a
manner consistent with the exemptions provided by Rule 16(b)(3) promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

     SECTION 4.05  No Appraisal Rights.  In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Offer or, other than pursuant to Section
262(b)(3) of the DGCL, the Merger.

                                       A-16

     SECTION 4.06  Parent Rights Plan.  Each person entitled to receive shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article shall receive together with such
shares of Parent Common Stock the number of Parent Rights per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the number of Parent Rights associated with one share of
Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time.

     SECTION 4.07  Affiliates.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no Parent Common Stock shall be delivered to a person who may be deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company in accordance with Section 8.08 hereof for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act until such person has executed and
delivered to Parent an executed copy of the affiliate letter contemplated in
Section 8.08 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE V

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     As an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the
Company, except as disclosed in the Company's disclosure schedule delivered
concurrently with the delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     SECTION 5.01  Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.  (a) Each of
the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (each a "Subsidiary") is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power
and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such power, authority and governmental approvals are not reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholders' Agreement
(collectively, the "Transactions") or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its material obligations under this Agreement or the
Stockholders' Agreement and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing as are not reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its material obligations under this
Agreement or the Stockholders' Agreement and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) A true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of the
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary owned by
the Company and each other Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 5.01(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company does not directly or indirectly own any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity, other than
the equity interest that it owns in each Subsidiary.

     (c) Each Subsidiary that is material to the business, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole is
so identified in Section 5.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and is
referred to herein as a "Material Subsidiary".

     SECTION 5.02  Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.  The Company has
heretofore furnished or made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each Material Subsidiary.
Such Certificates of Incorporation, By-Laws or equivalent organizational
documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation,
By-Laws or equivalent organizational documents.
                                       A-17

     SECTION 5.03  Capitalization.  (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 30,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company
Preferred Stock"). As of December 21, 2001, (i) 14,519,944 shares of Company
Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock are held in the
treasury of the Company, (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock are held by the
Subsidiaries and (iv) 3,426,767 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for
future issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock options granted pursuant
to the Company Stock Option Plan. As of December 21, 2001, no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section
5.03 or the Stockholders' Agreement, and except for the Company Rights issued
pursuant to the rights agreement, dated as of November 7, 2001 (the "Company
Rights Agreement"), between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as rights agent, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary. Section 5.03(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information with respect to
each Company Stock Option outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i) the
name and employment division of the optionee; (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; (iii) the exercise
price of such Company Stock Option; (iv) the date on which such Company Stock
Option was granted; (v) the applicable vesting schedule; (vi) the date on which
such Company Stock Option expires; and (vii) whether the exercisability of such
option will be accelerated in any way by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and indicates the extent of acceleration. All shares of Company
Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are
no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
any capital stock of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
Subsidiary or any other person. There are no commitments or agreements of any
character to which the Company is bound obligating the Company to accelerate the
vesting of any Company Stock Option as a result of the Merger. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, all outstanding Company Stock Options, and all
outstanding shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company have been
issued and granted in compliance with (i) all applicable securities laws and
other applicable Laws (as defined below) and (ii) all requirements set forth in
applicable contracts.

     (b) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as set
forth in Section 5.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each such share is
owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on the Company's or any Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

     SECTION 5.04  Authority Relative to This Agreement and the Stockholders'
Agreement.  The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement, subject to
any required approval and adoption of this Agreement by a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Stockholders' Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, if
and to the extent required by applicable law, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). Each of this Agreement
and the Stockholders' Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
                                       A-18

delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles. The Company Board has approved this Agreement, the
Stockholders' Agreement and the Transactions and such approvals are sufficient
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of
the DGCL shall not apply to the Merger or any of the Transactions. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover statute is applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.05  No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.  (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement by the Company
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
Laws or any equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other
actions described in Section 5.05(b) have been obtained and all filings and
obligations described in Section 5.05(b) have been made, conflict with or
violate any United States or non-United States statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or other
order ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(iii) except as set forth in Section 5.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which are not
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material
obligations under this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement and are not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

     (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Stockholders'
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
Stockholders' Agreement by the Company will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any United States
federal, state, county, local or non-United States government, governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or
any court, tribunal, judicial or arbitral body or supranational authority (a
"Governmental Authority"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of
the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and
state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), and filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by
the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, are not
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material
obligations under this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement, and are not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.06  Permits; Compliance.  Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the
Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, except franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority the failure of
which to have, or the suspension or cancellation of which are not reasonably
likely to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material obligations
under this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement and are not reasonably
likely,

                                       A-19

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (the
"Company Permits"). As of the date of this Agreement, no suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened. Except as set forth in Section 5.06 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in conflict with,
or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or
any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, Company Permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which the Company or any Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or
violations that are not reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company
from performing its material obligations under this Agreement and the
Stockholders' Agreement and are not reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.07  SEC Filings; Financial Statements.  (a) The Company has filed
all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since December 31, 1998, and has heretofore
delivered or made available to Parent, in the form filed with the SEC, (i) its
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1999
and 2000, respectively, (ii) its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods
ended March 31, 2001, June, 30, 2001 and September 30, 2001, (iii) all proxy

special) held since December 31, 1997 and (iv) all other forms, reports and
other registration statements (other than Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q not
referred to in clause (ii) above filed by the Company with the SEC since
September 30, 2001 (the forms, reports and other documents referred to in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above being, collectively, the "Company SEC
Reports"). The Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects as to
form with either the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary is required to file
any periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

     (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as
otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments which have not had, and are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect).

     (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2000,
including the notes thereto (the "Company Balance Sheet") and the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof and except as set forth in Section
5.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities and obligations,
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
December 31, 2000, which are not reasonably likely to prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay
the Company from performing its material obligations under this Agreement or the
Stockholders' Agreement and are not reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                                       A-20

     (d) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not
been filed by the Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other
instruments that previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are
currently in effect.

     SECTION 5.08  Information to Be Supplied.  (a) Each of the Schedule 14D-9
and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the other documents required to be filed
by the Company with the SEC in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as
the case may be. Each of the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and any of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Merger Registration Statement and the Offer Documents, will
not, on the date of its filing or mailing or, in the case of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting or, in the
case of the Offer Documents, at the time the Offer is commenced or at the
Acceptance Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.08, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents, Merger Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Schedule 14D-9 based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein or based on information which is not made in
or incorporated by reference in such documents but which should have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 6.07.

     SECTION 5.09  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Since December 31,
2000, except as set forth in Section 5.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or

contemplated by this Agreement (a) the Company and the Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practice, (b) there has not been any Company Material
Adverse Effect, and (c) none of the Company or any Subsidiary has taken any
action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a
breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 7.01.

     SECTION 5.10  Absence of Litigation.  Except as set forth in Section 5.10
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, or any property or
asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before any Governmental Authority that
(a) individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) seeks to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any
material property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar
written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority that
would prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material obligations
under this Agreement or the Stockholders' Agreement or is reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.11  Employee Benefit Plans.  (a) Section 5.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other contracts or
agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, with respect to
which

                                       A-21

the Company or any Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of
any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any
Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such
plan has been or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the
Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA,
and (iv) any contracts, arrangements or understandings between the Company or
any Subsidiary and any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary including,
without limitation, any contracts, arrangements or understandings relating in
any way to a sale of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Plans").
Each Plan is in writing and the Company has furnished or made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of each Plan and has delivered to Parent a true
and complete copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with
each such Plan, including, without limitation, (i) a copy of each trust or other
funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and summary of material
modifications, (iii) the most recently filed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
Form 5500, (iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each
such Plan, and (v) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial
statement in connection with each such Plan. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment (i) to create, incur liability
with respect to or cause to exist any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide
compensation or benefits to any individual, or (iii) to modify, change or
terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA or the Code.

     (b) Except as provided in Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single
employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for
which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans (i)
provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-type
benefits to any person, (ii) obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to pay
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially
as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any
benefit as a result of a "change in control", within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises
retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary.

     (c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be performed by them
under, are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and have no
knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact or event
exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Action.

     (d) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to the Plan for
which determination letters are currently available that the Plan is so
qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and,
to the Company's knowledge, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

     (e) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan that
could subject the Company or a Subsidiary to any material liability. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability under, arising out of or
by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit
                                       A-22

Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course), including, without
limitation, any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or
(ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and,
to the Company's knowledge, no fact or event exists which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such liability.

     (f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with
respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All such
contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and no
fact or event exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
challenge or disallowance.

     SECTION 5.12  Labor and Employment Matters.  (a) Except as set forth in
Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no
controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between
the Company or any Subsidiary and any of their respective employees, which
controversies are reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Merger or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its material obligations under this Agreement or are reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such
employees; (iii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has materially breached
or otherwise materially failed to comply with any provision of any such
agreement or contract, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
material grievances outstanding against the Company or any Subsidiary under any
such agreement or contract; (iv) to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
unfair labor practice complaints pending against the Company or any Subsidiary
before the National Labor Relations Board or any current union representation
questions involving employees of the Company or any Subsidiary; and (v) there is
no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threat thereof, by or with respect to any employees of the Company or
any Subsidiary. The consent of the labor unions which are a party to the
collective bargaining agreements listed in Section 5.12 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is not required to consummate the Transactions.

     (b) The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable laws relating to the employment of labor, including
those related to wages, hours, collective bargaining and the payment and
withholding of taxes and other sums as required by the appropriate Governmental
Authority and have withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority
or are holding for payment not yet due to such Governmental Authority all
material amounts required to be withheld from employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary and are not liable for any material arrears
