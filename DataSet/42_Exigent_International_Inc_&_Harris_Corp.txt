BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS, TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS AND
AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY.

     
Past Transactions between Harris and the Company.
Certain of Harris'
operations are conducted in the same industry segment as those of the Company.

In addition, the principal executive offices of each of Harris and the Company
are located in Melbourne, Florida, and certain of the Company's executives had
previously held executive positions with Harris.
Accordingly, Harris has
generally been aware of the Company and its business activities for some time.

     
On February 2, 2000, Exigent Software Technology, Inc., a Florida
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a
services subcontract with Harris.
The nature of this work is classified.
On
August 4, 2000, Exigent Digital Telecom & Wireless Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a
subcontract with Harris whereby it agreed to provide JTRS integration support
and XML definition.

     Background of the Offer.
In November 2000, the Company announced that its
Board of Directors had authorized the Company's management to explore strategic
alternatives, including the possible sale of all or a part of the Company's
assets, and that the Company had retained CIBC World Markets as its financial
advisor to assist the Company in these efforts.

     
During November 2000, Harris was contacted to solicit Harris' interest in a
possible transaction with the Company.
Harris was requested to submit a
preliminary indication of interest during the month of January 2001.

     
In January 2001, Harris submitted a preliminary indication of interest
reflecting a total equity valuation for the Company of $16 million in cash.
This
proposal was based solely on Harris' review of publicly available information.

As of January 26, Harris entered into a confidentiality agreement to enable
Harris access to non-public information of the Company, and Harris was provided
with a descriptive memorandum concerning the Company.
The confidentiality
agreement contained customary standstill provisions with respect to acquisitions
by Harris of Company securities.

     
During the week of February 5, 2001, Harris orally increased its
preliminary indication of interest to reflect a total equity valuation for the
Company of $22 million in cash.

     
During February and March 2001, Harris commenced a broader due diligence of
the Company.
During the week of February 26, 2001, the Company provided Harris
with access to detailed information concerning the Company at an off-site
location, and Harris attended Company management presentations regarding the
Company and its business operations.

     
By letter dated March 19, 2001, Harris submitted a written bid to acquire
one hundred percent (100%) of the Company's fully-diluted capital stock for $22
million in cash.

     
During negotiations conducted from March 21, 2001 through March 23, 2001,
Harris orally increased its offer to $23 million in cash.

     
From March 23, 2001 until April 2, 2001, the parties, assisted by their
respective legal advisors, negotiated the terms of the definitive Merger
Agreement and discussed the open transaction terms to be negotiated.

     
On April 2, 2001, the Board of Directors of Harris approved the transaction
and all further actions related thereto and authorized and approved certain
officers of Harris to negotiate and execute any documents or other instruments
required to complete the transaction.

     
On April 2, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company met and unanimously
voted to approve the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Tender Agreement.

     
In the evening of April 2, 2001, the Company, Harris and the Offeror
executed the Merger Agreement, and Bernard R. Smedley, Harris and the Offeror
executed the Voting and Tender Agreement.

     
On April 3, 2001, prior to the opening of financial markets, Harris and the
Company issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.
On April 17,
2001, the Offeror commenced the Offer.


12.
PURPOSE OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY; APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

     
The purpose of the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions is to enable Harris to acquire control of, and the entire equity
interest in, the Company.
Through the Offer, the Offeror intends to acquire
control of, and a majority equity interest in, the Company.
Following the
completion of the Offer, Harris intends to acquire any outstanding Shares not
owned by the Offeror by consummating the Merger.
The Merger Agreement provides
for a merger of the Offeror with and into the Company, with the Company being
the surviving corporation.

     
Under the DGCL, the approval of the Company's Board of Directors and,
unless the Merger is consummated pursuant to section 253 of the DGCL as
described below, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are required to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Company's Board of Directors has adopted
unanimously the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, and, unless the Merger is
consummated pursuant to the short form merger provisions under the DGCL as
described below (in which case no action by the Company's stockholders will be
required to consummate the Merger), the only remaining required corporate action
of the Company to consummate the Merger would be the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.
If the Minimum
Condition is satisfied and the Offeror purchases the Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer, the Offeror will have sufficient voting power to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of
the Company.

     
Short-Form Merger.
Section 253 of the DGCL provides that, if a parent
corporation owns at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each
class of capital stock of a subsidiary corporation, the merger of the parent
corporation with the subsidiary corporation may be effected by having the board
of directors of the parent corporation approve and adopt a resolution or plan of
merger and by making the appropriate filings with the Delaware Secretary of
State, without any action or vote on the part of the subsidiary corporation's
stockholders.
Accordingly, if the Offeror acquires, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares and ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of the Class A Preferred Stock, the
Offeror will be able to effect the Merger without a vote of the Company's
stockholders.
However, if

the Offeror does not acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares and
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, a longer period of time may be required to effect the
Merger, because a vote of the Company's stockholders would be required under the
DGCL.

     
Appraisal Rights.
Stockholders do not have appraisal rights as a result of
the Offer.
However, if the Merger is consummated, holders of Shares at the
Effective Time will have certain rights pursuant to the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL to dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of their Shares.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, dissenting stockholders who comply with the
applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial
determination of the fair value of their Shares (exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) and to
receive payment of such fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any.
Any such judicial determination of the fair value of Shares
could be based upon factors other than, or in addition to, the Offer Price or
the market value of the Shares.
The value so determined could be more or less
than the Offer Price.

     
THE FOREGOING SUMMARY OF SECTION 262 DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE AND IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SECTION 262.
FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE
STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

     
Rule 13e-3.
The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act,
which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may, under
certain circumstances, be applicable to the Merger or another business
combination in which the Offeror seeks to acquire the remaining Shares not held
by it following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer.
The Offeror
believes, however, that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable to the Merger if the
Merger is consummated within one (1) year after the termination of the Offer at
the Offer Price.
If applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that
certain financial information concerning the Company and certain information
relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the consideration
offered to minority stockholders in such transaction be filed with the
Commission and disclosed to stockholders prior to consummation of the
transaction.

     
Plans for the Company.
Harris will continue to evaluate the business and
operations of the Company during the pendency of the Offer and after the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger.
Harris intends to seek additional
information about the Company during this period.
Thereafter, Harris intends to
review such information as part of a comprehensive review of the Company's
assets, corporate structure, capitalization, business, operations, policies,
management and personnel with a view to optimizing the Company's potential
contribution to Harris' business.
After such review, Harris will determine what
actions or changes, if any, would be desirable in light of the circumstances
that then exist, including steps to integrate the operations of the Surviving
Corporation and the operations of Harris.

     
Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, Harris does not have any
current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the
following: an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation, involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; a sale or
transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries; any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the
Company; any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or
indebtedness or capitalization of the Company; or any other material change in
the Company's corporate structure or business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
promptly after the Offeror acquires the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
Offeror will be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Company's Board of Directors of the Company,
subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, as is equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors
(giving effect to the directors designated by the Offeror) multiplied by the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Offeror or any
affiliate of the Offeror bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.

The Company is obligated to take promptly all actions necessary to cause the
Offeror's designees to be elected as directors of the Company.
In addition,
assuming the designation of directors as aforesaid and so long as there are
holders of Shares other than Harris or any of its subsidiaries, Harris expects
that the Company's Board of Directors would not declare dividends on the Shares.

     
The Offeror and Harris intend to cause the Company to make an application
for termination of registration of the Shares as soon as possible after
consummation of the Offer if the Shares are then eligible for

such termination.
In such event, following the consummation of the Merger, there
will be no publicly traded Shares outstanding.
See Section 7 of this Offer to
Purchase.

Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Merger Agreement provides that the Offeror, without the consent

if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before December 31, 2001.

     
The Merger.
The Merger Agreement provides that as promptly as practicable
and in no event later than ninety (90) days after the consummation of the Offer
and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, in the event that the Offeror
acquires at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares and ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, the Offeror
shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware law and,
as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Offeror shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").
In the event that the Offeror does not acquire at
least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares and ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, the Company will duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

     
The respective obligations of the Offeror and Harris, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (i) the Merger Agreement shall

extent required by applicable law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and The Chicago Stock Exchange; (ii) no
United States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, or governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency or commission or court of
competent jurisdiction ("Governmental Authority") shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any law, order, executive order, stay, decree,
judgment, injunction or other order or statute, rule or regulation that is in
final effect and that has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by the
Offeror or

Harris or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Transactions; and (iii) the Offeror shall have
purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Condition, unless any failure to purchase is a
result of a breach of the Offeror's obligation to purchase any Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

     
At the Effective Time of the Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Shares owned by Harris, the Offeror or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Harris, and Shares held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights under
Delaware law) and share of Class A Preferred Stock will be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price paid pursuant to the
Offer, without interest, and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of the
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Offeror will be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving

the Surviving Corporation.

     
The Company's Board of Directors.
The Merger Agreement provides that
promptly upon the purchase by the Offeror of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
Offeror shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded

affiliate of the Offeror bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.

of Directors, (ii) each board of directors of each domestic Subsidiary, and
(iii) each committee of each board of directors of each domestic Subsidiary, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

If required by applicable law in order to consummate
the Merger, the Company, in accordance with applicable law and the Company's

modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Offeror or
Harris, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any such
committee of the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the Merger, or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Business Combination
Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Board of Directors, to
the extent required by the fiduciary obligations thereof, as determined in good
faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof based on the advice of
outside counsel, may approve or recommend (and, in connection therewith,
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement and the Merger) a Superior Proposal.
"Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide Business Combination Proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares then outstanding or all
or a material portion of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and
otherwise on terms that a majority of the disinterested members of the Company's
Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with the Company's independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
holders of Shares than the Offer and the Merger from a financial perspective and
for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of a majority of such disinterested members (after
consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor), is reasonably
likely to be financed by such third party.

     
Indemnification and Insurance.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are
set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
unless such modification shall be required by Delaware law.
In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Harris and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date of the Merger Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the approval of the Surviving
Corporation (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or otherwise in
connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the person controlled by
the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter existing or
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including any Claim arising out of the Merger

Agreement or any of the Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law and by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, and shall pay any expenses, as
incurred, in advance of the disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and by the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of
the Merger Agreement.

     
Harris also has agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to maintain in
effect for three (3) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
(provided that Harris may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable)
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in the event that the annual premium for such coverage is more
than two (2) times the annual premium for such coverage as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, Harris shall be obligated only to maintain the best coverage
that reasonably can be obtained for an annual premium equal to two (2) times the
annual premium in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement; provided,
further, that in no event shall the policy limits of such coverage be less than
two-thirds ( 2/3) of the policy limits in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement.

     
Employee Benefits.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company is
required to terminate the Exigent International, Inc. Employee 401(K)
Profit
Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the Exigent International, Inc.
Money Purchase Pension Plan and Trust prior to the Effective Time.
The Company
also was required to, and did, suspend purchases and contributions under the
Exigent International, Inc.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective as of April
1, 2001 through the Effective Time.

     
The Merger Agreement also provides that, following the Offeror Election
Date, Harris is required to cause the Company (and, after the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation) and each of the Subsidiaries to honor all accrued benefit
obligations to current and former employees and directors under the Company's or
such Subsidiaries' employee benefit plans and fringe benefit plans in existence
on the date of the Merger Agreement and all employment or severance agreements
entered into by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or adopted by the
Company's Board of Directors prior to the date of the Merger Agreement;

provided, however, that nothing shall prevent Harris or the Company (and, after
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) from taking any action with respect to
such plans, obligations or agreements or refraining from taking any such action
which is permitted or provided for under the terms thereof or under applicable
law.

     
The Merger Agreement further provides that, among other things, employees
of the Company and the Subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in Harris'
employee benefit plans and programs as of the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such plans and programs as applicable to similarly
situated employees of Harris or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, and
applicable law.
Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation) will be given credit for their length of
service with the Company and any Subsidiaries under all employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of the Surviving Corporation or Harris in which they are
eligible to participate or become participants for all purposes thereunder,
except to the extent that such crediting would produce a duplication of benefits
or violate any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended, or the Code.
Harris is required to provide and recognize all accrued
but unused vacation and sick days of employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time.

     
Amendment to the Rights Agreement.
The Company represented and warranted to
the Offeror and Harris in the Merger Agreement that (i) the Company's Board of
Directors has taken all necessary action (including any amendment thereof) under
the Rights Agreement (without redeeming the Rights) so that none of the
execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement, the making or consummation of the
Offer (including the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer), the
consummation of the Voting and Tender Agreement or the consummation of any of
the Transactions will cause (a) the Rights to become exercisable under the
Rights Agreement or to separate from the stock certificates to which they are
attached, (b) an "Acquisition Date" under the Rights Agreement to occur, or (c)
the Offeror, Harris or any of their affiliates to

be deemed an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights Agreement; and (ii) the Rights
Agreement, as so amended, has not been further amended or modified.

by a preponderance of the evidence.

customary representations and warranties to the Company with respect to, among

     Date shall not have occurred on or before June 1, 2001 or the Effective

     however, that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this
     provision shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
     obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
     in, the failure of the Tender Offer Acceptance Date or the Effective Time
     to occur on or before such date;

          (c) by Harris if: (i) due to an occurrence or circumstance that
     results in a failure to satisfy any Offer Condition, the Offeror shall have
     (A) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for payment
     thereunder, or (B) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer within
     ninety (90) days following the commencement of the Offer, unless any such
     termination or failure listed above shall have been caused by or resulted
     from the failure of the Offeror or Harris to perform in any material
     respect any covenant or agreement of either of them contained in the Merger
     Agreement or the material breach by

     the Offeror or Harris of any representation or warranty of either of them
     contained in the Merger Agreement; or (ii) prior to the purchase of Shares
     pursuant to the Offer, (A) the Company's Board of Directors shall have

     against the Company's stockholders tendering their shares into such tender
     offer or exchange offer, (D) the Company shall have breached any of its

     any other person from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or Section
     607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act, or (F) any person shall
     have become an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights Agreement, or the
     Company's Board of Directors shall have taken action excluding a person
     from becoming an "Acquiring Person" who, in the absence of such Board
     action, would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights
     Agreement; or

          (d) by the Company if: (i)
the Offeror shall have (A) failed to
     commence the Offer within fifteen (15) days following the date of the
     Merger Agreement, (B) terminated the Offer without having accepted any
     Shares for payment thereunder, or (C) failed to pay for Shares pursuant to
     the terms of the Offer or as required under the DGCL, unless such failure

     material respect any covenant or agreement contained in the Merger
     Agreement or the Voting and Tender Agreement, respectively, or the material
     breach by the Company or the Tendering Stockholder of any representation or

The above-referenced termination provisions are sometimes referred to,
collectively, or individually, as the "Termination Rights.
"

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to pay Harris the
Harris Expenses (defined below) and the Termination Fee (defined below) if the
Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) or (d)(ii) of the
Termination Rights; provided, however, that in the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated pursuant to clauses (B), (C), (E) or (F) of paragraph (c)(ii) or
pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of the Termination Rights, the Termination Fee
shall not be payable unless the Superior Proposal, tender offer or other
transaction giving rise to the termination is consummated.
In addition, in the
event that after the date of the Merger Agreement a Business Combination
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
stockholders or any person shall have announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Business Combination Proposal and thereafter the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(i) or paragraph (d)(i) of the
Termination Rights as a result of the Minimum Condition not being satisfied and
within twelve (12) months of such termination such person acquires, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares then outstanding or all
or a material portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, then
the Company shall pay Harris an amount equal to the Termination Fee, less any
amounts, if any, paid pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
Any
amounts payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are payable upon
the consummation of the transaction or the occurrence of the event giving rise
to such obligation.

     
For purposes of the Merger Agreement and this Offer to Purchase,
"Termination Fee" means a fee equal to $690,000, less any previously paid Harris
Expenses, and "Harris Expenses" means the documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses reasonably incurred and paid by or on behalf of Harris in connection
with the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Voting and Tender
Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including all governmental filing fees and fees and expenses of counsel,

commercial banks, printers, paying agents, dealer managers, accountants, experts
and consultants up to a maximum amount of $400,000.

     
Except as described in this Section 13, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

     
Amendment.
The Merger Agreement may be amended by the Company's, the
Offeror's and Harris' respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions are approved by the Company's stockholders, if necessary, the
Merger Agreement may not be amended if such amendment would violate the DGCL.

The Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the Company, the Offeror and Harris.

any other Business Combination Proposal, or (ii) any amendment of the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other proposal or transaction
involving the Company or any of its affiliates, which amendment or other
proposal or transaction
would in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or
nullify the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (c)
he shall not (i) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or

Offeror's designee, or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy,

Business Combination Proposal; and (d) so long as the Merger Agreement has not
been terminated and the Offer is not amended in a manner prohibited by the
Merger Agreement, he shall tender pursuant to the Offer, and not withdraw any of
the Shares owned by him.

     
The Voting and Tender Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement (see the paragraph
entitled "Termination; Fees" above); provided, however, that the Voting and
Tender Agreement will not terminate until ninety (90) days after a termination
pursuant to clause (ii) above if (A) the Merger Agreement is terminated by
Harris or the Offeror pursuant to paragraph (c) of the Termination Rights
because of the withdrawal or modification in the approval or recommendation, by
the Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof, of the Offer, the

this Offer to Purchase, or because the Company's Board of Directors or any

Directors or any committee thereof has adopted a resolution to effect such

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Offeror and
Harris, and may be asserted by the Offeror or Harris regardless of the

each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.


16.
CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS.

     
Except as described in this Section 16, based on a review of publicly
available filings by the Company with the Commission and other publicly
available information concerning the Company, the Offeror is not aware of any
approval or other action by any governmental or administrative agency that would
be required for the acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Offeror as
contemplated herein.
Should any such approval or other action be required, it
will be sought, but the Offeror has no current intention to delay the purchase
of

Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter,
subject, however, to the Offeror's right to decline to purchase Shares if any of
the conditions specified in Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase shall have
occurred.
There can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if
needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions,
or that adverse consequences might not result to the Company's business or that
certain parts of the Company's business might not have to be disposed of if any
such approvals were not obtained or other action taken.

     
U.S. Antitrust.
The Offeror is not aware of any approval or other action by
any governmental or administrative agency that would be required for the
acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Offeror as contemplated herein under
the provisions of the HSR Act.

     
Section 203 of the DGCL.
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware.
As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to Section
203 of the DGCL.
In general, Section 203 would prevent an "interested
stockholder" (generally defined as a person beneficially owning fifteen percent
(15%) or more of a corporation's voting stock) from engaging in a "business
combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions with a
Delaware corporation) for three (3) years following the date such person became
an interested stockholder unless: (1) before such person became an interested
stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved the transaction
in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved
the business combination, (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted
in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owned at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the voting stock of the
corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for
purposes of determining the number of shares of outstanding stock held by
directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not allow
plan participants to determine confidentially whether to tender shares), or (3)
following the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder,
the business combination is (x) approved by the board of directors of the
corporation, and (y) authorized at a meeting of the stockholders by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a least sixty-six and two-thirds percent
(66 2/3%) of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the
interested stockholder.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 203, the
Company's Board of Directors unanimously has approved the Merger Agreement and,
therefore, the restrictions of Section 203 are inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions.

     
Florida Control Share Acquisitions.
The Company also is subject to Section
607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "Florida Control Share
Acquisition Statute").
The Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute applies to
publicly held corporations, such as the Company, that have a sufficient presence
in Florida and provides that shares of such corporations that are acquired in a
"control share acquisition" generally will have no voting rights unless such
rights are conferred on those shares by the vote of the holders of a majority of
all the outstanding shares other than interested shares.
A "control share
acquisition" is defined, with certain exceptions, as the acquisition of the
ownership of voting shares that would cause the acquiror to have voting power
within the following ranges or to move upward from one range into another: (i)
twenty percent (20%), but less than thirty-three and one-third percent
(33 1/3%); (ii) thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%), but less than
fifty percent (50%); or (iii) fifty percent (50%) or more of such votes.
The
Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute does not apply to an acquisition of
shares if such acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of that
corporation before the acquisition.
In accordance with the provisions of the
Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute, the Company's Board of Directors
unanimously has approved the Merger Agreement and, therefore, the restrictions
of the Florida Control Share Acquisition Statute are inapplicable to the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions.

     
Other State Takeover Laws.
The Company and certain of its Subsidiaries
conduct business in a number of other states throughout the United States, some
of which have adopted laws and regulations applicable to offers to acquire
shares of corporations that are incorporated or have substantial assets,
stockholders and/or a principal place of business in such states.
In Edgar v.
Mite Corp., the Supreme court of the United States held that the Illinois
Business Takeover Statute, which involved state securities laws that made the
takeover of certain corporations more difficult, imposed a substantial burden on
interstate commerce and was therefore unconstitutional.
In CTS Corp. v. Dynamics
Corp. of America, however, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a
state may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, those laws
concerning corporate

governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the
affairs of a target corporation without prior approval of the remaining
stockholders, provided that such laws were applicable only under certain
conditions, in particular, that the corporation has a substantial number of
stockholders in and is incorporated under the laws of such state.
Subsequently,
in TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a federal district court in Oklahoma
ruled that certain Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they
applied to corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject
such corporations to inconsistent regulations.
Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc.
v. McReynolds, a federal district court in Tennessee ruled that four (4)
Tennessee takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations
incorporated outside Tennessee.
This decision was affirmed by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

     
Except as otherwise discussed in this Offer to Purchase, neither the
Offeror nor Harris has determined whether any other state takeover laws and
regulations will by their terms apply to the Transactions, and, except as set
forth above, neither the Offeror nor Harris presently has sought to comply with
any state takeover statute or regulations.
The Offeror and Harris reserve the
right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law or regulation
purporting to apply to the Transactions, and neither anything in this Offer to
Purchase nor any action taken in connection herewith is intended as a waiver of
such right.
In the event it is asserted that one (1) or more state takeover laws
is applicable to the Transactions and an appropriate court does not determine
that such law(s) is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Transactions, the
Offeror and/or Harris might be required to file certain information with, or to
receive approval from, the relevant state authorities.
In addition, if enjoined,
the Offeror might be unable to accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the
Transactions.
In such event, the Offeror may not be obligated to accept for
payment any Shares tendered.
See Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase.

17.
FEES AND EXPENSES.

     
Neither the Offeror nor Harris, nor any officer, director, stockholder,
agent or other representative of the Offeror or Harris, will pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person (other than the Information
Agent and the Dealer Manager) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to or
making recommendations in connection with the Offer.
Brokers, dealers,
commercial banks and trust companies and other nominees will, upon request, be
reimbursed by the Offeror for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred
by them in forwarding materials to their customers.

     
Georgeson Shareholder Securities Corporation ("Georgeson Securities") is
acting as Dealer Manager in connection with the Offer.
Harris has agreed to pay
Georgeson Securities reasonable compensation for such services.
In addition,
Harris has agreed to reimburse Georgeson Securities for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses related to its engagement and has agreed to indemnify
Georgeson Securities against certain liabilities in connection with the Offer.

     
The Offeror has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. as
Information Agent and Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. as Depositary in
connection with the Offer.
The Information Agent and the Depositary will receive
reasonable and customary compensation for their services hereunder and
reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
The Information Agent
and the Depositary also will be indemnified by the Offeror against certain
liabilities in connection with the Offer.
The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, e-mail, telex, telegraph and personal interviews and
may request brokers, dealers and other nominee holders of Shares to forward
materials relating to the Offer to beneficial owners of Shares.

18.
MISCELLANEOUS.

     
The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on
behalf of, holders of Shares residing in any jurisdiction in which the making or
acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such
jurisdiction.
However, the Offeror, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
take such action as it may deem necessary to enable it to make the Offer in any
such jurisdiction and extend the Offer to holders of Shares in such
jurisdiction.

     
NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF THE OFFEROR OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN THIS OFFER TO
PURCHASE OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
AND, IF ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR
REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN OR MADE, IT SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN
AUTHORIZED BY THE OFFEROR OR HARRIS.

     
The Offeror and Harris have filed with the Commission the Schedule TO,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to Manatee Merger Corp. (the "Offeror"), a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Harris"), the above-described shares of Common Stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights), par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Exigent International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to the Offeror's offer to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a purchase price of $3.55 per Share,
net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer
to Purchase, and any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer").
The Offer is being made in connection with the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 2, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Harris, the Offeror, and the Company.

     
Subject to and effective upon acceptance for payment of and payment for the
Shares tendered herewith, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to
or upon the order of the Offeror all right, title and interest in and to all the
Shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and all other Shares or other
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof) and appoints the Depositary
the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect
to such Shares (and all such other Shares or securities), with full power of
substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power
coupled with an interest), to (a) deliver certificates for such Shares (and all
such other Shares or securities), or transfer ownership of such Shares (and all
such other Shares or securities) on the account books maintained by the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together, in any such case, with all accompanying
evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of the Offeror, (b)
present such Shares (and all such other Shares or securities) for transfer on
the books of the Company and (c) receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all
rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares (and all such other Shares or
securities), all in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

     
The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each designee of the Offeror as
the agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, each with full power
of substitution, to exercise all voting and other rights of the undersigned in
such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole
judgment deem proper, with respect to all of the Shares tendered hereby which
have been accepted for payment by the Offeror prior to the time of any vote or
other action (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued
or issuable in respect of such Shares) at any meeting of shareholders of the
Company (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned meeting), any
actions by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise.
This proxy
is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest in the Shares and is granted in
consideration of, and is effective upon, the acceptance for payment of such
Shares by the Offeror in accordance with the terms of the Offer.
Such acceptance
for payment shall revoke any other power of attorney, proxy or written consent
granted by the undersigned at any time with respect to such Shares (and all such
other Shares or other securities or rights), and no subsequent powers of
attorney or proxies will be given or written consents will be executed by the
undersigned (and if given or executed, will not be deemed effective).
The
undersigned understands that in order for Shares to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon the acceptance for payment of such Shares, the Offeror or its
designee must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such Shares
and other securities, including voting at any meeting of shareholders.

     
The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights
issued or issuable in respect of such Shares) and that when the same are
accepted for payment by the Offeror, the Offeror will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims.
The undersigned, upon
request, will execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the
Depositary or the Offeror to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Shares tendered hereby (and all such other Shares
or other securities or rights).

     
All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors
and assigns of the undersigned.
Except as stated in the Offer, this tender is
irrevocable.

     
The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares pursuant to any one of
the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto will constitute an agreement between the undersigned and the
Offeror upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

     
Unless otherwise indicated under "Special Payment Instructions," please
issue the check for the purchase price of any Shares accepted for payment, and
return any Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment, in the name(s) of
the undersigned.

     
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under "Special Delivery
Instructions," please mail the check for the purchase price of any Shares
accepted for payment and return any certificates for Shares not tendered or not
accepted for payment (and accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the
undersigned at the address shown below the undersigned's signature(s).

Instructions" are completed, please issue the check for the purchase price of
any Shares purchased and return any Shares not tendered or not purchased in the
name(s) of, and deliver said check and any certificates to, the person(s) so

that any Shares not accepted for payment be returned by crediting such account

designate by making an appropriate entry under "Special Payment Instructions.
"
The undersigned recognizes that the Offeror has no obligation, pursuant to the
"Special Payment Instructions," to transfer any Shares from the name of the
registered holder(s) thereof if the Offeror does not accept for payment any of
the Shares so tendered.

.  DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND SHARES.  
This Letter of
Transmittal is to be used either if certificates for Shares are to be forwarded
herewith or, unless an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) is
utilized, if the delivery of Shares is to be made by book-entry transfer
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

Certificates for all physically delivered Shares, or a confirmation of a
book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility of all Shares delivered electronically, as well as a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) and any other
documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, or an Agent's Message in the
case of a book-entry delivery, must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the front page of this Letter of Transmittal prior to the
Expiration Date.
Stockholders who cannot deliver their Shares and all other
required documents to the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date must tender
their Shares pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in Section
3 of the Offer to Purchase.
Pursuant to such procedures: (a) such tender must be
made by or through an Eligible Institution; (b) a properly completed and duly
executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by
the Offeror, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date;
and (c) the certificates for all tendered Shares, in proper form for tender, or
a confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the

a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must
be received by the Depositary within three trading days after the date of
execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, all as provided in Section 3 of
the Offer to Purchase.

SmallCap Market is open for business.

     
THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY,
IS AT THE OPTION AND SOLE RISK OF THE TENDERING HOLDER OF SHARES.
SHARES WILL BE
DEEMED DELIVERED ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN
THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY A CONFIRMATION OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER).

IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY
INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED.
IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     
No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted, and no
fractional Shares will be purchased.
By executing this Letter of Transmittal (or
a facsimile thereof), the tendering holder of Shares waives any right to receive
any notice of the acceptance for payment of the Shares.

     
3.  INADEQUATE SPACE.  
If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
certificate numbers, the number of Shares and any other required information
should be listed on a separate schedule attached hereto and separately signed on
each page thereof in the same manner as this Letter of Transmittal is signed.

     
4.  PARTIAL TENDERS (NOT APPLICABLE TO HOLDERS OF SHARES WHO TENDER BY
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER).  
If fewer than all the Shares represented by any
certificate delivered to the Depositary are to be tendered, fill in the number
of Shares which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered."
In such case, a new certificate for the remainder of the Shares
represented by the old certificate will be sent to the person(s) signing this
Letter of Transmittal unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box marked
"Special Payment Instructions" and/or "Special Delivery Instructions" on this
Letter of Transmittal, as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Date.

All Shares represented by certificates delivered to the Depositary will be
deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     
5.  
SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  
If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificates without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

     
If any of the Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more
persons, all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     
If any of the Shares tendered hereby are registered in different names on
different certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as
many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
certificates.

     
If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock powers
are required unless payment of the purchase price is to be made, or Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of any person other
than the registered holder(s), in which case the certificate(s) for such Shares
tendered hereby must be endorsed, or accompanied by, appropriate stock powers,
signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the
certificate for such Shares.
Signatures on any such certificates or stock powers
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     
If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Shares tendered hereby, the certificate must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, signed exactly as the
name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the certificates for such
Shares. Signature(s) on any such certificates or stock must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution.

     
If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed
by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to
the Offeror of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted.

     
6.  
STOCK TRANSFER TAXES.  
The Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any
stock transfer taxes with respect to the sale and transfer of any Shares to it
or its order pursuant to the Offer.
If, however, payment of the purchase price
is to be made to, or Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be returned in
the name of, any person other than the registered holder(s), then the amount of
any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), such
other person or otherwise) payable on account of the transfer to such person
will be deducted from the purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the
payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted.

     
Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificates listed in this Letter of
Transmittal.

     
7.  SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTION.  
If the check for the
purchase price of any Shares purchased is to be issued, or any Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of a person other than
the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or if the check or any
certificates for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be mailed to
someone other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or to the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal at an address other than that shown
above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed.

Holders of Shares tendering Shares by book-entry transfer may request that
Shares not purchased be credited to such account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility as such holder of Shares may designate under "Special Payment
Instructions."
If no such instructions are given, any such Shares not purchased
will be returned by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above.

     
8.  
SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9.  
Under U.S. Federal income tax law, a tendering
holder of Shares whose Shares are accepted for payment is required to provide
the Depositary with such holder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN")
on Substitute Form W-9, which is provided below, unless an exemption applies.

Failure to provide the information on the Substitute Form W-9 may subject the
tendering holder of Shares to a $50 penalty and to 31% federal income tax backup
withholding on the payment of the purchase price for the Shares.

     
9.  FOREIGN HOLDERS.  
Foreign holders must submit a completed IRS Form W-8
to avoid 31% backup withholding.
IRS Form W-8 may be obtained by contacting the
Depositary at one of the addresses on the face of this Letter of Transmittal.

     
10.  REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES.  
Requests for assistance
or additional copies of the Offer to Purchase and this Letter of Transmittal may
be obtained from the Information Agent at its address or telephone number set
forth below.

     11.  WAIVER OF CONDITIONS.  
The conditions of the Offer may be waived by
the Offeror (subject to certain limitations in the Merger Agreement), in whole
or in part, at any time or from time to time, in the Offeror's sole discretion.

     
12.  
LOST, DESTROYED, MUTILATED, OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES.  
If any
certificate(s) representing Shares has been lost, destroyed, mutilated, or
stolen, the holder of such Shares should promptly notify the Depositary by
calling 1-(800) 777-3674.
The holder of Shares will then be instructed as to the
steps to be taken in order to replace the certificate(s) or agreement(s).
This
Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the
procedures for replacing lost, destroyed, mutilated or stolen certificates have
been followed.

     
IMPORTANT:  THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR A FACSIMILE COPY HEREOF (TOGETHER
WITH CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS) OR A NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (AS DEFINED IN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE).

                           
IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under federal income tax law, a holder of Shares whose tendered Shares are
accepted for payment is required to provide the Depositary with such holder's
correct TIN on the Substitute Form W-9.
If such holder of Shares is an
individual, the TIN is such holder's Social Security Number.
If the Depositary
is not provided with the correct TIN, the holder of Shares may be subject to a
$50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.
In addition, payments that
are made to such holder of Shares with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer may be subject to backup withholding.

     
Certain holders of Shares (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements.
In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, that holder of Shares must submit a statement, signed under
penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status.
Such
statements may be obtained from the Depositary.
All exempt recipients (including
foreign persons wishing to qualify as exempt recipients) should see the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional instructions.

     
If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any payments made to the holder of Shares.
Backup withholding is not an
additional tax.
Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld.
If backup withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained.


PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup federal income tax withholding on payments that are made
to a holder of Shares with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer,
the holder is required to notify the Depositary of such holder's correct TIN by
completing the form certifying that the TIN provided on the Substitute Form W-9
is correct.


WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The holder of Shares is required to give the Depositary the Social Security
Number or Employer Identification Number of the record owner of the Shares.
If
the Shares are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner,
consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification
Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidelines on which number to
report.

The tender price is $3.55 per Share net to the seller in cash
     without interest.

          
2.
The Board of Directors of the Company unanimously has determined
     that the Offer and the Merger (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) are
     fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's holders of Shares, has
     approved the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement and unanimously
     recommends that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their
     Shares pursuant to the Offer.

          
3.
The Offer is being made for all of the outstanding Shares.

          
4.
The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 Midnight, New
     York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001, unless the Offer is extended.

          
5.
The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being
     validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
     that number of Shares constituting at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the
     Voting Shares (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the satisfaction of
     certain other terms and conditions.
For purposes of this letter, "Voting
     Shares" means the then outstanding Shares, together with (a) all of the
     Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, par value
     $.01 per share, and (b) all of the Shares issuable under Options (as
     defined in the Merger Agreement) that are or may become exercisable between
     the date on which the Offeror first pays for Shares validly tendered and
     not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "Tender Offer Acceptance Date")
     and the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or under any
     other option, warrant, convertible security or right or other commitment or
     arrangement in effect on the Tender Offer Acceptance Date.
If the Minimum
     Condition or any other condition to the Offer is not satisfied by 12:00
     Midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 15, 2001 (or any other time
     then set as the Expiration Date), the Offeror may, subject to the terms of
     the Merger Agreement, elect to (i) withdraw the Offer or allow it to expire
     and not accept for payment any Shares and return all tendered Shares to
     tendering holders of Shares, or (ii) extend the Offer as provided in the
     Merger Agreement and, subject to applicable withdrawal rights, retain all
     tendered Shares until the expiration of the Offer, as extended, or (iii)
     waive such condition (in the case of the Minimum Condition, with the
     consent of the Company) and purchase all Shares validly tendered and not
     withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

          
6.
Tendering holders of Shares will not be obligated to pay brokerage
     fees or commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter
     of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer of Shares pursuant to
     the Offer.

     
In order for holders of Shares to accept the Offer, (i) a duly executed and
properly completed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) and any required
signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) or other required documents should
be sent to the Depositary and (ii) Certificates representing the tendered Shares
or a timely Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) should
be delivered to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the Offer.

     
If holders of Shares wish to tender, but it is impracticable for them to
forward their Certificates or other required documents or complete the
procedures for book-entry transfer prior to the Expiration Date, a tender must
be effected by following the guaranteed delivery procedures specified in Section
3 of the Offer to Purchase.

     
Neither the Offeror, Harris nor any officer, director, shareholder, agent
or other representative of the Offeror will pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, dealer or other person (other than the Dealer Manager and the
Information Agent as

described in the Offer to Purchase) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to
the Offer.
The Offeror will, however, upon request, reimburse you for customary
mailing and handling expenses incurred by you in forwarding any of the enclosed
materials to your clients.
The Offeror will pay or cause to be paid any transfer
taxes payable on the transfer of Shares to it, except as otherwise provided in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

To Our Clients:

     Enclosed for your consideration are the Offer to Purchase, dated April 17,
2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the related Letter of Transmittal (which,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the
"Offer") relating to an offer by Manatee Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Offeror") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Harris"), to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock
(including the associated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights), par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Exigent International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), at a purchase price of $3.55 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Offer.
Also enclosed is a letter to holders
of Shares of the Company from Bernard R. Smedley, the Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, together with a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company and mailed to the holders of
Shares.
The Offer is being made in connection with the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of April 2, 2001, among Harris, the Offeror and the Company
(the "Merger Agreement").
This material is being forwarded to you as the
beneficial owner of Shares carried by us in your account but not registered in
your name.

     
WE ARE THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.
A TENDER
OF SUCH SHARES CAN BE MADE ONLY BY US AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD AND PURSUANT TO
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.
THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS FURNISHED TO YOU FOR YOUR
INFORMATION ONLY AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU TO TENDER SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR
ACCOUNT.

     
If a holder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and such
holder's certificates for Shares are not immediately available or time will not
permit all required documents to reach the Depositary (as defined in the Offer
to Purchase) prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)
or the procedure for book-entry transfer of Shares cannot be completed on a
timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered according to the
guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

See Instruction 2 of the Letter of Transmittal.
Delivery of documents to the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in accordance
with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures does not constitute delivery
to the Depositary.

     
Accordingly, we request instructions as to whether you wish to tender any
or all of the Shares held by us for your account, upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the Offer.

     
Please note the following:

          1.
The tender price is $3.55 per Share net to the seller in cash
     without interest.
