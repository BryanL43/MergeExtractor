BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     In early 2000, Guest Supply's management concluded that a combination of
Guest Supply with another large company in a complementary industry was likely
to result in the greatest value for Guest Supply shareholders as compared to
leaving Guest Supply as a stand-alone company.
Guest Supply's management reached
this conclusion based on a number of factors including that Guest Supply, as a
stand-alone microcap company, had no meaningful research coverage by securities
analysts, provided limited liquidity to its shareholders due to the lack of
trading volume in Guest Supply common stock and, like many microcap companies,
was experiencing, over time, a decline in the earnings multiple at which the
Guest Supply common stock traded despite improved earnings performance for Guest
Supply.
The prospect of a combination with a larger company in a complementary
industry appeared to offer the prospect of maximizing value and liquidity for
Guest Supply's shareholders.
While Guest Supply's management considered other
options such as combining with a company of comparable size, commencing a
broad-based share repurchase plan, effecting a divestiture of assets, pursuing
acquisitions with a view to creating greater size and scale for Guest Supply, or
undertaking a management-led leveraged buy-out with a financial partner, Guest
Supply's management and board of directors concluded that combining with a
larger company in a complementary industry would create the greatest value and
liquidity for shareholders.

     
Following preliminary discussions with prospective financial advisors, on
June 19, 2000, Guest Supply engaged an investment banking firm, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray, to act as Guest Supply's financial advisor in connection with a
possible sale of Guest Supply or its assets.
As part of their services to Guest
Supply, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed with Guest Supply's management the
alternatives considered by management in early 2000.

     
Guest Supply's management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray then identified a
number of third parties who might have an interest in combining with Guest
Supply.

     
Commencing in July 2000, representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
contacted 24 potential strategic acquirors and three potential financial
acquirors in an effort to ascertain, on a preliminary basis, their level of
interest in combining with Guest Supply.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray then sent
public investor packages to 11 potential acquirors who initially expressed
interest in a combination with Guest Supply.

     
Representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray arranged introductory
meetings between representatives of Guest Supply and five potential acquirors,
including SYSCO.

     
On July 6 and July 21, 2000, Daniel Donoghue, a managing director of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, telephoned John Stubblefield, Executive Vice President,
Finance and Administration, of SYSCO soliciting SYSCO's interest in pursuing a
potential transaction with Guest Supply.

     
On July 27, 2000, Messrs. Stubblefield and Donoghue discussed the merits of
a combination of SYSCO and Guest Supply.
Mr. Donoghue also answered preliminary
questions posed by Mr. Stubblefield concerning Guest Supply's operations and
business prospects.
Mr. Donoghue then provided Mr. Stubblefield with Guest
Supply's public investor package.
Messrs. Stubblefield and Donoghue engaged in
occasional preliminary discussions about a possible combination between July
2000 and September 2000.

     
On September 19, 2000, SYSCO executed a confidentiality agreement with
Guest Supply in preparation for a meeting with Guest Supply's senior management
team.

     
On September 21, 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray hosted an introductory
meeting in Chicago between Guest Supply and SYSCO.
Senior representatives from
both companies attended this meeting, including Richard Schnieders, President
and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Stubblefield of SYSCO, as well as Clifford
W. Stanley, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul T. Xenis, Chief
Financial Officer of Guest Supply.
Messrs. Stanley and Xenis made a slide
presentation discussing Guest Supply's business, customers, industry and
historical financial performance.
After this presentation, Messrs. Stanley and
Xenis answered questions and provided a broad overview as to how a potential
combination might improve both Guest Supply's and SYSCO's future prospects.

     
From June until September 2000, Guest Supply, with the assistance of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, had extensive discussions with BFMA Holding Corporation
("BFMA") based upon BFMA's then-stated intention to offer $24.00 per share for
Guest Supply's common stock.
After over three months of discussions, Guest
Supply terminated negotiations based in part on concerns over BFMA's ability to
finance the transaction.
In November 2000, BFMA commenced a solicitation of
proxies for the election at the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Guest
Supply of two Class C Directors nominated by BFMA.
BFMA also announced that it
was prepared to offer $21.00 per share for Guest Supply's common stock.
On
January 23, 2001, following announcement of the execution of the merger
agreement, BFMA announced that it intended to withdraw its proxy solicitation.

     
On October 19, 2000, Mr. Stubblefield and Robert G. Culak, Vice President,
Financial Reporting & Compliance of SYSCO participated in a conference call with
Messrs. Stanley and Xenis of Guest Supply to answer due diligence questions.

SYSCO and Guest Supply also discussed the strategic and financial rationale for
a possible transaction.
In response to this call, Guest Supply sent a package of
due diligence materials to SYSCO answering several questions raised on the
conference call.

     
On October 27, 2000, Messrs. Stubblefield and Culak of SYSCO participated
in an additional conference call with Messrs. Stanley and Xenis of Guest Supply
to discuss the due diligence package previously sent as well as to answer
additional questions.
Beginning on this date, and continuing until the merger
agreement was signed, representatives of SYSCO continued their due diligence
investigation of Guest Supply, including the exchange of information regarding
the business and operations of Guest Supply.

     
On November 20, 2000, Mr. Donoghue and Jonathan Leiman, also of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to advise him of the BFMA
proxy solicitation.
Later that day, Mr. Stubblefield telephoned Mr. Donoghue to
inform him that SYSCO intended to make an offer to acquire Guest Supply on
November 27, 2000.

     
On November 21, 2000, Mr. Donoghue telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to inquire
as to whether he had any additional information requests and Mr. Stubblefield
advised Mr. Donoghue that SYSCO would make an offer for Guest Supply on November
29, 2000.
On November 29, 2000, SYSCO sent a draft proposal to Guest Supply
indicating a willingness to acquire Guest Supply for $25.00 per share.

     
On December 1, 2000, Mr. Donoghue telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to review the
value, timing and the structure of the transaction.

     
On December 5, 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray participated in a
conference call with the Guest Supply board of directors to discuss the proposed
offer.

     
On December 7, 2000, SYSCO provided Guest Supply a written letter of intent
indicating its willingness to acquire Guest Supply for $25.00 per share.
Guest
Supply did not execute this letter.

     
On December 15, 2000, the Guest Supply board of directors authorized
management to enter into an exclusivity and termination fee agreement with
SYSCO.
This agreement provided for an exclusive negotiating period through
January 20, 2001 whereby Guest Supply agreed not to solicit, initiate or
encourage any alternative proposals.
The agreement further provided that if
Guest Supply violated this provision, accepted an alternative proposal, and
subsequently consummated an alternative transaction, Guest Supply would be
required to pay SYSCO a termination fee of $5.5 million.

     
On December 18 and 19, 2000, representatives of SYSCO and SYSCO's counsel,
Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, conducted legal due diligence at the offices of
Torys, legal counsel to Guest Supply.
Legal due diligence activities continued
through the execution of the merger agreement.

     
On December 26, 2000, Charles H. Cotros, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of SYSCO, visited Guest Supply's Orlando, Florida distribution
center and met briefly with Mr. Xenis.

     
On January 2, 2001, Messrs. Cotros, Schnieders and Stubblefield,
accompanied by Michael C. Nichols, Vice President and General Counsel of SYSCO,
visited Guest Supply's headquarters, distribution and manufacturing facilities
in New Jersey.
On January 3, 2001, Messrs. Schnieders, Stubblefield and Nichols
visited Guest Supply's facilities in Cleveland, Ohio.

     
On January 2, 2001, Thomas E. Lankford, Executive Vice President, Food
Service Operations and a Director of SYSCO, and Larry J. Accardi, Executive Vice
President, Merchandising Services & Multi-Unit Sales, visited Guest Supply's
facilities in Dallas, Texas.
On January 3, 2001, they visited Guest Supply's
facilities in Los Angeles, California.

     
From January 2, 2001 through January 5, 2001, Mr. Culak and representatives
of Arthur Andersen conducted a review of Guest Supply's financial records at
Guest Supply's headquarters in New Jersey.

     
On January 15, 2001, members of senior management of SYSCO, members of
senior management of Guest Supply, including Mr. Stanley, Mr. Xenis and Thomas
M. Haythe, Guest Supply's General Counsel, and representatives of U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray participated in a telephone conference during which the SYSCO
representatives made a presentation about SYSCO's business, customers, industry,
and historical financial performance.
After this presentation, the SYSCO
representatives responded to questions from the Guest Supply representatives.

     
On January 16, 2001, SYSCO's board of directors met by telephone conference
call to review the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction with Guest
Supply.
Eleven of the twelve members of SYSCO's board of directors were present
at the meeting.
By unanimous vote of the directors present, the officers of
SYSCO were authorized to proceed with the offer and the merger.

     
On January 18, 2001, Messrs. Donoghue and Stubblefield had a final
telephonic negotiation of the price and terms of the proposed offer during which
Mr. Stubblefield agreed to increase the price offered for the Guest Supply
common stock from $25.00 to $26.00 per share in SYSCO common stock.

     
On January 19, 2001, Guest Supply's board of directors met to consider the
proposed transaction and merger agreement and related agreements.
The meeting
was attended by all of the Guest Supply directors.
At the meeting, Mr. Stanley,
representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and Mr. Haythe addressed the
board of directors about the business, financial and legal implications,
respectively, of a merger between SYSCO and Guest Supply and the terms of the
proposed agreements.
During that meeting, representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray informed the board that in the opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as
of January 19, 2001 (subsequently updated on the date of the merger agreement),
the exchange ratio under the proposed agreement, the offer and merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to Guest Supply stockholders.
After discussion,
Guest Supply's board of directors unanimously voted to approve the agreement and
the merger and unanimously resolved to recommend that Guest Supply stockholders
accept the offer and tender their shares of Guest Supply's common stock in the
offer.
At the meeting, Guest Supply's board of directors approved an amendment
to its preferred stock rights plan in order to exempt the offer and merger from
the provisions of the rights plan.

     
On January 20, 2001, SYSCO and Guest Supply executed an extension of the
exclusivity agreement, extending the arrangement through January 22, 2001.

     
On January 22, 2001, SYSCO's executive committee held a telephonic board
meeting with its legal advisors and management, and discussed the final terms
and conditions of the offer and the merger as set forth in the merger agreement
and related agreements.
Six of the seven members of the committee were present
at the meeting.
SYSCO's executive committee approved the merger agreement and
the related transactions, including the offer and the merger, by the unanimous
vote of the members of the committee present at the meeting.

     
On January 22, 2001, the parties executed the merger agreement and related
documents.
Immediately thereafter, SYSCO and Guest Supply issued a press release
announcing the proposed offer and merger.

                                   
THE OFFER

BASIC TERMS

     Exchange Of Shares; Exchange Ratio.  
We are offering to exchange shares of
our common stock based on an exchange ratio, as described below, for the
outstanding shares of Guest Supply common stock that are validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn.
If the average of the closing prices per share of our
common stock on the NYSE for each of the 15 consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day that is five trading days prior to the expiration date of the
offer, as it may be extended from time to time, which we refer to as the SYSCO
average trading price, is:

     - at least $22.00 but less than or equal to $30.00, Guest Supply
       stockholders shall receive for each Guest Supply share a number of SYSCO
       shares equal to $26.00 divided by the SYSCO average trading price;

     - less than $22.00, Guest Supply stockholders shall receive for each Guest
       Supply share approximately 1.1818 SYSCO shares; or

     - more than $30.00, Guest Supply stockholders shall receive for each Guest
       Supply share approximately 0.8667 SYSCO shares.

     
The SYSCO average trading price cannot be determined with certainty at this
time.

 
ILLUSTRATIVE TABLE OF EXCHANGE RATIOS AND VALUE OF OFFER/MERGER CONSIDERATION

     
The following table shows:

     - illustrative values of the exchange ratios that will result if the SYSCO
       average trading price is within a range of $19.00 to $33.00 per share,
       representing the number of shares of our common stock that will be issued
       for one share of Guest Supply common stock at each of the SYSCO average
       trading prices presented in the table; and

     - illustrative values of the approximate consideration that would be issued
       in connection with the offer and the merger for one Guest Supply common
       share, which illustrative values are determined by multiplying each of
       the SYSCO average trading prices presented in the table by the
       corresponding exchange ratio.

                                                              APPROXIMATE

                 * See "Fluctuations in Market Price" below.

     
The values of our common shares in the table above are illustrative only
and do not represent the actual amounts per Guest Supply common share that might
be realized by any Guest Supply stockholder on or after completion of the offer
or the merger.
The amount any Guest Supply stockholder might realize upon sale
in the market of our common shares received in the offer or the merger will
depend upon the market price per share of our common shares at the time of sale,
which will fluctuate depending upon any number of reasons, including those
specific to us and those that influence the trading prices of equity securities
generally.

     Fluctuations In Market Price.  
Because the SYSCO average trading price is
an average of closing prices, it might be different from the actual market value
of a share of our common stock on the date we issue shares to the Guest Supply
stockholders.
The market value of shares of SYSCO common stock issued in
exchange for each share of Guest Supply might actually be less than $26.00 on
the date we issue those shares.
In addition, prior to the completion of the
offer, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued for each share of
Guest Supply common stock will change if the trading price of our common stock
changes but does not go below $22.00 or exceed $30.00.

     
More Information About The Exchange Ratio.  
We will notify Guest Supply
stockholders by issuing a press release announcing the exchange ratio and filing
that press release with the SEC.
Guest Supply stockholders can call our
information agent, MacKenzie Partners, at any time collect at (212) 929-5500 or
toll free at (800) 322-2885 to request information about the SYSCO average
trading price, including the exchange ratio for the offer, once determined.

     
Transfer Charges.  
Stockholders tendering shares will not be obligated to
pay any charges or expenses of the exchange agent.
Stockholders owning shares
through a broker or other nominee may be charged a fee.
Guest Supply
stockholders should consult their broker or nominee to determine whether any
charges will apply.

     Merger.  
We are making this offer in order to acquire the entire equity
interest in Guest Supply.
As soon as possible after completion of the offer, we
will cause Guest Supply and Sysco Food Services of New Jersey to complete the
merger.
At the effective time of the merger, each share of Guest Supply common
stock, except for shares held by Guest Supply, us or Sysco Food Services of New
Jersey, will be converted into the right to receive the same number of our
shares for each Guest Supply share at the same exchange ratio as in the offer.

If we obtain all of the shares of Guest Supply pursuant to the offer and the
merger, former stockholders of Guest Supply will own less than 1.5% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon the respective number of
shares of SYSCO and Guest Supply outstanding on January 29, 2001.
The exact
percentage of our shares outstanding that former Guest Supply stockholders will
hold is dependent on the exchange ratio, which cannot be determined at this
time.

     
Stockholders List.  
We have relied on Guest Supply's stockholders list and
security position listings to communicate with you and to distribute the offer
to you.
We are sending this prospectus, related letter of transmittal and other
relevant materials to you and to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees,
appear on Guest Supply's stockholders list or, if applicable, who are listed as
participants in a clearing agency's security position listing.


TIMING OF THE OFFER

     The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on March 5, 2001.


EXTENSION, SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     
The offer is scheduled to expire on March 5, 2001.
We are required to
complete the offer at the end of the then current offer period, without further
extension, when the minimum tender condition and all other conditions have been
satisfied or, if allowed, waived by us.
We are also required to extend the
expiration date of the offer in increments of up to 10 business days until the
earlier of April 30, 2001 or such time as all conditions, including the minimum
tender condition, have been satisfied or waived.
Finally, we may extend the
offer as required to comply with SEC rules and regulations.

     
We have elected to provide a subsequent offering period as described below.

     
During any extension of the initial offering period (but excluding the
subsequent offering period), all Guest Supply shares previously tendered and not
properly withdrawn will remain tendered, subject to the right to withdraw them.

We will accept and pay for all shares tendered and not withdrawn promptly
following the expiration date of the offer, if the minimum tender condition and
all other conditions have been satisfied or waived.

     
Without the prior written consent of Guest Supply, we may not:

     - amend or waive the minimum tender condition;

     - decrease or change the form of consideration to be paid;

     - decrease the number of shares sought in the offer;

     - waive the condition that the fairness opinion given by U.S. Bancorp Piper
       Jaffray shall not have been modified or withdrawn;

     - impose conditions in addition to those set forth in the merger agreement
       or that would in any other way adversely affect the Guest Supply
       stockholders; or

     - extend the expiration date of the offer except as discussed above.

     
Subject to the SEC's rules and regulations and the terms of the merger
agreement, we also reserve the right to terminate the offer and not accept or
exchange any Guest Supply shares not previously accepted or exchanged upon the
failure of any of the conditions of the offer to be satisfied.

     
If, on April 30, 2001, SYSCO has not completed the offer in accordance with
the terms of the merger agreement, SYSCO will terminate the offer without
accepting any shares previously tendered, and if less than 35% of the
outstanding shares of Guest Supply on a fully diluted basis have been tendered,
the merger agreement will automatically terminate.
However, if at least 35% but
less than a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis have
been validly tendered by April 30, 2001, we will terminate the offer and will
seek to consummate the merger.
Immediately following any extension, delay,
termination or amendment, we will make a public announcement of the same.

     
We have elected to provide a subsequent offering period of five business
days after the acceptance of and payment for Guest Supply shares in the initial
offering period.
We may extend the subsequent offering period for up to an
additional fifteen business days if the requirements under Exchange Act Rule
14d-11 have been met.
The exchange ratio will be the same as in the initial
offering period.
You will not have the right to withdraw Guest Supply shares
that you tender in the subsequent offering period, if any.

EXCHANGE OF GUEST SUPPLY SHARES; DELIVERY OF OUR COMMON STOCK

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, and any
extension or amendment, we will exchange Guest Supply shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn promptly after the expiration date of the offer and promptly
after they are tendered during the subsequent offering period.
In addition,
subject to applicable SEC rules and the merger agreement terms, we reserve the
right to delay acceptance or exchange of Guest Supply shares in order to comply
with any applicable law.
In all cases, exchange of Guest Supply shares tendered
and accepted for exchange pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely
receipt by the exchange agent of:

     - certificates for those Guest Supply shares or a confirmation of a
       book-entry transfer of those Guest Supply shares in the exchange agent's
       account at The Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as DTC;

     - a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a
       facsimile of that document) or agent's message if applicable; and

     - any other required documents.

     
You should read the information under the caption "The Offer -- Procedure
for Tendering" for more details on tendering your shares.

     
For purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange
Guest Supply shares validly tendered and not withdrawn when we notify the
exchange agent of our acceptance of such shares.


The exchange agent will deliver our common stock in exchange for Guest Supply
shares tendered pursuant to the offer promptly after receipt of such notice.
The
exchange agent will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of
receiving our common stock from us and transmitting such stock to you.

     
If we do not accept any tendered Guest Supply shares pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for
more Guest Supply shares than are tendered, we will return certificates for such
tendered Guest Supply shares or untendered Guest Supply shares, as the case may
be, without expense to the tendering stockholder.
In the case that Guest Supply
shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the exchange agent's account at DTC
pursuant to the procedures set forth below under the discussion entitled
"-- Procedure for Tendering" are not accepted for transfer, those Guest Supply
shares will be credited to an account maintained within DTC promptly following
expiration or termination of the offer.

     
If we increase the consideration offered to Guest Supply stockholders in
the offer prior to the expiration date of the offer, such increased
consideration will be given to all stockholders whose Guest Supply shares are
tendered pursuant to the offer, whether or not such Guest Supply shares were
tendered or accepted for exchange prior to the increase in consideration.
We
currently have no intention of increasing the consideration offered.


CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

     We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of our common
stock pursuant to the offer or the merger.
Instead, each Guest Supply
stockholder will receive an amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
equal to such fraction multiplied by the SYSCO average trading price or, if
applicable, the SYSCO average trading merger price, used in the offer or the
merger.
Guest Supply stockholders will not receive any interest on the cash to
be received for fractional shares, even if there is a delay in making the
exchange and payment.


WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Guest Supply shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any
time prior to the expiration date of the offer.
During the subsequent offering
period, you will not have the right to withdraw Guest Supply shares that you
tender in the subsequent offering period.

     
For your withdrawal to be effective, the exchange agent must receive from
you a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at its address set
forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice must include your
name, address, social security number, the certificate number(s), the number of
Guest Supply shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder, if
different from you.

     
A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal.
Most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses are
able to effect these signature guarantees for you.
The financial institution
must be a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
Medallion Signature Program or the Stock Exchange
Medallion Program, any of which are an "eligible institution," unless those
Guest Supply shares have been tendered for the account of any eligible
institution.
If Guest Supply shares have been tendered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry exchange discussed under the caption entitled
"-- Procedure for Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and
number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn Guest Supply
shares and must otherwise comply with DTC's procedures.
If certificates have
been delivered or otherwise identified to the exchange agent, the name of the
registered holder and the serial numbers of the particular certificates
evidencing the Guest Supply shares withdrawn must also be furnished to the
exchange agent, as stated above, prior to the physical release of such
certificates.
We, working in conjunction with the exchange agent, will decide
all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any
notice of withdrawal, in our sole discretion, and our decision shall be final
and binding.
Neither we, the exchange agent, the information agent nor any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or will incur any liability for
failure to give any such notification.
Any Guest Supply shares properly
withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the
offer.
However, you may retender withdrawn

Guest Supply shares by following one of the procedures discussed under the
captions entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering" or "-- Guaranteed Delivery" at
any time prior to the expiration date of the offer.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING

     
For you to validly tender Guest Supply shares pursuant to the offer:

     - the enclosed letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed
       (or a manually executed facsimile of that document), along with any
       required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a
       book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must be
       transmitted to and received by the exchange agent at its address set
       forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and certificates for Guest
       Supply shares tendered must be received by the exchange agent at such
       address or those Guest Supply shares must be tendered pursuant to the
       procedures for book-entry exchange set forth below and a confirmation of
       receipt of such tender received, which confirmation we refer to below as
       a "book-entry confirmation," in each case before the expiration date of
       the offer; or

     - you must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below.

     
The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in DTC exchanging the Guest Supply shares which are the subject of
such book-entry confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to
be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce that
agreement against such participant.

     
The exchange agent will establish accounts with respect to the Guest Supply
shares at DTC for purposes of the offer and any financial institution that is a
participant in DTC may make book-entry delivery of the Guest Supply shares by
causing DTC to transfer such Guest Supply shares into the exchange agent's
account in accordance with DTC's procedure for such transfer.
However, although
delivery of Guest Supply shares may be effected through book-entry at DTC, the
letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), with any required signature
guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other required documents, must, in any case, be transmitted to and received
by the exchange agent at its address set forth on the back cover of this
prospectus prior to the expiration date of the offer, or you must comply with
the guaranteed delivery procedures described below.

     
Signatures on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible
institution, except in cases in which Guest Supply shares are tendered either by
a registered holder of Guest Supply shares who has not completed the box
entitled "Special Issuance Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions" on the letter of transmittal or for the account of an eligible
institution.

     
If the certificates for Guest Supply shares are registered in the name of a
person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or if
certificates for untendered Guest Supply shares are to be issued to a person
other than the registered holder(s), the certificates must be endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the
name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates, with
the signature(s) on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed in the manner we
have described above.

     
The method of delivery of Guest Supply share certificates and all other
required documents, including delivery through DTC, is at your option and risk,
and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the exchange
agent.
If delivery is by mail, we recommend that stockholders use an overnight
or hand delivery service.
In all cases, you should allow sufficient time to
ensure timely delivery.

     
To prevent backup federal income tax withholding with respect to cash, if
any, received pursuant to the offer, you must provide the exchange agent with
your correct taxpayer identification number and certify whether you are subject
to backup withholding of federal income tax by completing the substitute Form
W-9 included in the letter of transmittal.
Some stockholders (including, among
others, all

corporations and some foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup
withholding and reporting requirements.
In order for a foreign individual to
qualify as an exempt recipient, the stockholder must submit a Form W-8 or Form
W-8BEN, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt
status.

     
Each Guest Supply stockholder that receives our common shares in the offer
and/or the merger should file a statement with his, her or its federal income
tax return setting forth the stockholder's basis in the Guest Supply shares
surrendered and the fair market value of our common shares and the proceeds from
the sale of fractional shares received in the offer and the merger, and should
retain permanent records of these facts relating to the offer and the merger.


GUARANTEED DELIVERY

     If you wish to tender Guest Supply shares pursuant to the offer and your
certificates are not immediately available or you cannot deliver the
certificates and all other required documents to the exchange agent prior to the
expiration date of the offer or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry
transfer on a timely basis, your Guest Supply shares may nevertheless be
tendered, so long as all of the following conditions are satisfied:

     - you make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

     - the enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery, properly completed and duly
       executed, substantially in the form enclosed with this prospectus, or an
       agent's message with respect to a guaranteed delivery that is accepted by
       SYSCO, is received by the exchange agent as provided below on or prior to
       the expiration date of the offer; and

     - the certificates for all Guest Supply shares to be tendered (or a
       confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such securities into the
       exchange agent's account at DTC as described above), in proper form for
       transfer, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
       transmittal (or facsimile thereof), with any required signature
       guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message)
       and all other documents required by the letter of transmittal, or a
       properly transmitted agent's message, are received by the exchange agent
       within three NYSE trading days after the date of execution of such notice
       of guaranteed delivery.

     
You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail it to the exchange agent and you must include a
signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form set forth in that
notice.

     
By executing a letter of transmittal as set forth above, you irrevocably
appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full
power of substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your
Guest Supply shares tendered and accepted for exchange by us and with respect to
any and all other Guest Supply shares and other securities issued or issuable in
respect of the Guest Supply shares on or after February 5, 2001.
That
appointment is effective, and voting rights will be affected, when and only to
the extent that we deposit with the exchange agent the shares of our common
stock for Guest Supply shares that you have tendered.
All such proxies shall be
considered coupled with an interest in the tendered Guest Supply shares and
therefore shall not be revocable.
Upon the effectiveness of such appointment,
all prior proxies that you have given will be revoked, and you may not give any
subsequent proxies and, if given, they will not be deemed effective.
Our
designees will, with respect to the Guest Supply shares for which the
appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all of your voting and other
rights as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper at any annual, special or
adjourned meeting of Guest Supply stockholders or otherwise.
We reserve the
right to require that, in order for Guest Supply shares to be deemed validly
tendered, immediately upon our acceptance for exchange of those Guest Supply
shares, we must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such
Guest Supply shares.

     
We will determine questions as to the validity, form, eligibility, time of
receipt and acceptance for exchange of any tender of Guest Supply shares, in our
sole discretion, and our determination shall be final

and binding.
We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of
Guest Supply shares that we determine are not in proper form or the acceptance
for exchange of or exchange for which may, in the opinion of our counsel, be
unlawful.
To the extent not otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we may waive
any of the conditions of the offer, other than the minimum tender condition, the
requirement that the merger agreement not have been terminated, and the
requirement that the fairness opinion not have been modified or withdrawn, or
any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Guest Supply shares.
No tender
of Guest Supply shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all
defects and irregularities in tenders of Guest Supply shares have been cured or
waived.
Neither we, the exchange agent, the information agent nor any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in the tender of any Guest Supply shares or will incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification.
Our interpretation of the
terms and conditions of the offer, including the letter of transmittal and
instructions thereto, will be final and binding.

     
The tender of Guest Supply shares pursuant to any of the procedures
described above will constitute a binding agreement between us and the tendering
stockholders upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer.


PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; THE MERGER; NO DISSENTERS RIGHTS

     Purpose.  
We are making the offer to acquire the entire equity interest in
Guest Supply.
The offer is the first step in our acquisition of Guest Supply and
is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all Guest Supply shares.
As soon as
possible after completion of the offer, we will cause Guest Supply and Sysco
Food Services of New Jersey to complete the merger.
The purpose of the merger is
to acquire all Guest Supply shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to the
offer.
At the effective time of the merger, each share of Guest Supply common
stock, except for shares held by Guest Supply, us, or Sysco Food Services of New
Jersey, will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of our
common stock at the same exchange ratio as in the offer.
Assuming satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to the merger, we are obligated to complete the
merger as promptly as practicable.

     
Approval of the Merger.  
Under Guest Supply's certificate of incorporation,
the approval of the board of directors and the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of its outstanding shares present and entitled to vote at a
meeting called for such purpose are required in order to approve the merger.
The
Guest Supply board of directors has approved the merger.
Therefore, unless the
merger is completed in accordance with the short form merger provisions under
New Jersey law described below, the only remaining corporate action of Guest
Supply is the approval of the merger agreement by the Guest Supply stockholders.

If we complete the offer, we will own a majority of the outstanding shares of
Guest Supply common stock and therefore we will be able to approve the merger
without the affirmative vote of any other Guest Supply stockholder.

     
Possible Short Form Merger.  
Section 14A:10-5.1 of the New Jersey Business
Corporation Act permits the merger to occur without a vote of Guest Supply
stockholders (a "short form merger") if we acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding Guest Supply shares in the initial offering period, any subsequent
offering period or otherwise.
If, however, we do not acquire at least 90% of the
then outstanding Guest Supply shares, and a vote of Guest Supply stockholders is
required under New Jersey law, a longer period of time will be required to
effect the merger.

     
No Dissenters Rights.  
Guest Supply stockholders do not have dissenters
rights in connection with the offer or the merger.


CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     The offer is subject to a number of conditions, including those described
below:

          Minimum Tender Condition.  
There must be validly tendered, and not
     withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the offer, a number of Guest
     Supply shares that constitutes at least a majority of the fully diluted
     Guest Supply shares.
Based on information supplied by Guest Supply, the
     number of

     shares needed to satisfy the minimum tender condition would have been
     3,973,037 as of January 31, 2001.

          
Antitrust Condition.  
The waiting period, and any extension thereof,
     applicable to the offer and the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the
     "HSR Act," and any other applicable antitrust law must have expired or been
     terminated.
We call this the "antitrust condition."
See "-- Regulatory
     Approvals" below.

          
Registration Statement Effectiveness Condition.  
The registration
     statement on Form S-4 of which this prospectus is a part must have been
     declared effective by the SEC and not be subject to any stop order or
     proceedings seeking a stop order.
We call this the "registration statement
     effectiveness condition.
"

          Other Conditions of the Offer.  
The offer, at the time of acceptance
     for exchange of Guest Supply shares is also subject to the following
     conditions:

        - no action or proceeding shall be pending before any governmental
          authority in the United States by any governmental authority in the
          United States that seeks to restrain or prohibit the transactions
          contemplated by the merger agreement;

        - no federal or state statute, rule, regulation, injunction, order or
          decree shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
          any governmental authority or court in the United States, Canada or
          England which prohibits the consummation of the transactions
          contemplated by the merger agreement;

        - Guest Supply shall not have breached its covenants, representations or
          warranties set forth in the merger agreement, resulting in a material
          adverse change in the Guest Supply business;

        - the merger agreement shall not have been terminated;

        - no material adverse change in the Guest Supply business shall exist;

        - Guest Supply shall have obtained required approvals under the New
          Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act;

        - the fairness opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray shall not have been
          modified or withdrawn;

        - Guest Supply shall have delivered to SYSCO a comfort letter from KPMG
          LLP in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to SYSCO;

        - Guest Supply shall have caused an opinion of its counsel to be
          delivered to SYSCO; and

        - Guest Supply shall have delivered to SYSCO a certificate signed by an
          authorized officer of Guest Supply certifying as to the satisfaction
          of certain of the conditions set forth above.

     
The conditions of the offer described above are solely for our and Sysco
Food Services of New Jersey's benefit and we may assert them regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions, including any action or
omission by us, other than a material and willful breach of the merger agreement
by us.
To the extent not otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we may waive
these conditions in whole or in part, other than the minimum tender condition,
the requirement that the merger agreement not have been terminated and the
requirement that the fairness opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray not have
been modified or withdrawn.
The failure by us at any time prior to expiration of
the offer to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the
offer.
Accordingly, all conditions of the offer must be satisfied or waived
prior to expiration of the offer.
The waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to
any other facts and circumstances.
Notwithstanding the fact that we reserve the
right to assert the failure of a condition in order to delay exchange or cancel
our obligation to exchange properly tendered Guest Supply shares, we will either
promptly exchange or return such Guest Supply shares.


REGULATORY APPROVALS

     We and Guest Supply have agreed in the merger agreement to use all
reasonable efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals with respect to the offer and the merger.
Other than
clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the offer and the merger which
are described above under "-- Conditions of the Offer -- Antitrust Condition,"
the SEC's declaring the effectiveness of the registration statement of which
this prospectus is a part, the filing of certificates of merger under New Jersey
corporate law and Delaware corporate law with respect to the merger, and certain
approvals from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, we do not
believe that any additional material governmental filings or approvals are
required with respect to the offer and the merger.

     
Under the HSR Act and the related rules, neither the offer nor the merger
may be completed until we and Guest Supply notify and furnish information to the
Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements have been
satisfied.
In connection with the offer and the merger, on January 26, 2001, we
filed with the FTC and the Antitrust Division the required notification and
report forms under the HSR Act.
Guest Supply shall file its required
notification and report forms under the HSR Act as promptly as possible, but not
later than February 2, 2001.
The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
relating to the offer and the merger is scheduled to expire at midnight on
February 25, 2001 unless it is earlier terminated or extended by a request for
additional information.

     
At any time before or after the completion of the offer or the merger,
either the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take any action under U.S.
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the offer or the merger or seeking
the divestiture of substantial assets owned by us or Guest Supply.
Private
parties and state attorneys general may also bring actions under U.S. antitrust
laws depending on the circumstances.
Although we believe that the offer and
merger do not raise significant concerns under U.S. antitrust laws, we can give
no assurance that a challenge to the offer or the merger on antitrust grounds
will not be made or, if this challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

     
The completion of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement
requires compliance with the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act.
In order
to comply with such act, Guest Supply has agreed to obtain from the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection with respect to each property owned or
leased by it in New Jersey a letter of non-applicability, a remediation
agreement or a regulated underground storage tank waiver.
Guest Supply has
applied for a remediation agreement.


EFFECTS OF OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity; Possible Delisting.  
According to Guest Supply, there
were, as of January 31, 2001, 6,848,575 Guest Supply common shares outstanding.

The tender of Guest Supply shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number
of Guest Supply stockholders and the number of Guest Supply shares that might
otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Guest Supply shares held by the public.
Guest Supply
shares are listed and traded on the NYSE.
Depending on the number of Guest
Supply shares acquired pursuant to the offer, following completion of the offer,
Guest Supply shares may no longer meet the requirements of the NYSE for
continued listing and the shares may be suspended or delisted.

     
The NYSE will normally give consideration to delisting a security when:

     - the number of total stockholders is less than 400;

     - the number of total stockholders is less than 1,200 and average monthly
       trading volume is less than 100,000 shares for the most recent 12 months;
       or

     - the number of publicly-held shares is less than 600,000.

     
Shares held directly or indirectly by directors, officers or beneficial
owners of more than 10% of the shares are not considered as being publicly held
for this purpose.
If, following the closing of the offer, the shares of Guest
Supply no longer meet the requirements of the NYSE, the market for the shares
could be adversely affected.

     
If the NYSE were to delist the Guest Supply shares, including after the
exchange of shares in the offer but prior to the merger, the market for them
could be adversely affected.
It is possible that Guest Supply shares would be
traded on other securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market, and that
price quotations would be reported by such exchanges or by other sources.
The
extent of the public market for the Guest Supply shares and the availability of
such quotations would, however, depend upon the number of holders and/or the
aggregate market value of the Guest Supply shares remaining at such time, the
interest in maintaining a market in the Guest Supply shares on the part of
securities firms, the possible termination of registration of Guest Supply
shares under the Exchange Act, as described below under "-- Registration under
the Exchange Act," and other factors.

     
We intend to complete the merger as soon as possible following completion
of the offer.
No shares of Guest Supply will remain publicly traded upon
completion of the merger.

     
Status as "Margin Securities."  
The Guest Supply shares are presently
"margin securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which
has the effect of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of Guest
Supply shares.
Depending on the factors similar to those described above with
respect to listing and market quotations, following the completion of the offer,
the Guest Supply shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the
purposes of the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the
Guest Supply shares would be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by
brokers.

     
Registration under the Exchange Act.  
Guest Supply shares are currently
registered under the Exchange Act.
Guest Supply can terminate that registration
upon application to the SEC if the outstanding shares are not listed on a
national securities exchange or market and if there are fewer than 300 holders
of record of Guest Supply shares.
Termination of registration of the Guest
Supply shares under the Exchange Act would reduce the information that Guest
Supply must furnish to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain
provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery
provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement
in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) and the
related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, no longer
applicable with respect to Guest Supply shares.
Furthermore, the ability of
"affiliates" of Guest Supply and persons holding "restricted securities" of
Guest Supply to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act may be impaired or eliminated.
If registration of the shares
under the Exchange Act were terminated, they would no longer be eligible for
NYSE listing or for continued inclusion on the Federal Reserve Board's list of
"margin securities.
"

RELATIONSHIPS WITH GUEST SUPPLY

     Except as set forth in this prospectus, neither we nor, to the best of our
knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any
contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any other person with
respect to any securities of Guest Supply, including, but not limited to, any
contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or
the voting of any such securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements,
puts or calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or the giving or
withholding of proxies.
Except as described in this prospectus, there have been
no contacts, negotiations or transactions within the last two years between us
or, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or
other affiliates on the one hand, and Guest Supply or its affiliates, on the
other hand, concerning a merger, consolidation or acquisition, a tender offer or
other acquisition of securities, an election of directors, or a sale or other
transfer of a material amount of assets.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Our acquisition of Guest Supply will be accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which
means that Guest Supply's results of operations

will be included with ours from the closing date and its consolidated assets and
liabilities will be recorded at their fair values at the same date.


FEES AND EXPENSES

     We have retained MacKenzie Partners to act as the information agent in
connection with the offer.
The information agent may contact holders of Guest
Supply shares by mail, telephone or other means, and may request brokers,
dealers and other nominee stockholders to forward the offer materials to
beneficial owners of Guest Supply shares.
The information agent will be paid a
customary fee for such services, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses,
and we will indemnify the information agent against certain liabilities and
expenses in connection with the offer, including liabilities under federal
securities laws.

     
In addition, we have retained EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. as the exchange
agent.
We will pay the exchange agent customary compensation for its services in
connection with the offer, will reimburse the exchange agent for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify the exchange agent against certain
liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

     
We will not pay any fees or commissions to any broker, dealer or other
persons (other than the information agent) for soliciting tenders of Guest
Supply shares pursuant to the offer.

     
Guest Supply received an opinion from U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray dated
January 22, 2001 to the effect that, as of that date, and subject to the
assumptions, factors and limitations set forth in their opinion, the exchange
ratio to be established pursuant to the merger agreement is fair to the Guest
Supply stockholders, from a financial point of view.
The opinion is attached as
an exhibit to Guest Supply's Schedule 14D-9, which was mailed to the Guest
Supply stockholders with a preliminary version of this prospectus, and Guest
Supply stockholders are urged to read such opinion in its entirety, including
the assumptions, factors and limitations contained therein.

     
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also provided certain financial advisory
services to Guest Supply in connection with the offer and the merger.
Under the
terms of the engagement letter dated June 19, 2000, Guest Supply has agreed to
pay U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a fee equal to 1.25% of the total sale price of
Guest Supply in connection with this transaction for U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's financial advisory services, a retainer fee of $100,000, $350,000 for
rendering the opinion described above, which fee will be credited against
payment of the fee for financial advisory services and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and to indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray against liabilities incurred.
Details concerning the arrangements
between Guest Supply and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray are disclosed in Guest
Supply's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which was
mailed to the Guest Supply stockholders with a preliminary version of this
prospectus.

                 
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TENDER AGREEMENTS

     The merger agreement and the form of the tender agreements are attached as
Annex A and Annex B, respectively, to this prospectus.

NYSE for each of the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading date that
is five trading days prior to the date of the Guest Supply stockholders' meeting
at which approval of the merger is being considered, which we refer to as the
SYSCO average trading merger price, is:

        - at least $22.00 but less than or equal to $30.00, Guest Supply
          stockholders shall receive for each Guest Supply share a number of
          SYSCO shares equal to $26.00 divided by the SYSCO average trading
          merger price;

        - less than $22.00, Guest Supply stockholders shall receive for each
          Guest Supply share approximately 1.1818 SYSCO shares; or

        - more than $30.00, Guest Supply stockholders shall receive for each
          Guest Supply share approximately 0.8667 SYSCO shares.

     
The SYSCO average trading merger price cannot be determined with certainty
at this time.


BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     After the merger, SYSCO will continue to be managed by the same Board of
Directors and officers of SYSCO as before the merger.
Information relating to
the management, executive compensation, voting securities, certain relationships
and related transactions and other related matters pertaining to SYSCO is
contained in or incorporated by reference in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended July 1, 2000.
Such Annual Report is incorporated by
reference into this prospectus.
See "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 5.

EXCHANGE AGENT; PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     Exchange Agent.  
At the time the merger becomes effective, we will deposit
with the exchange agent certificates representing the number of whole shares of
our common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement in exchange for the
outstanding shares of Guest Supply common stock.
We will also deposit with the
exchange agent a certificate representing the aggregated fractional shares which
would otherwise be issued in exchange for the surrendered Guest Supply shares
pursuant to the merger agreement.
Soon after the completion of the merger, the
exchange agent will send a letter to each person who was a Guest Supply
stockholder at the time the merger became effective.
The letter will contain
instructions on how to surrender Guest Supply stock certificates to the exchange
agent and receive shares of our common stock.
See "The Offer -- Procedure for
Tendering."

     Dividends.  
Holders of Guest Supply shares will not be entitled to receive
any dividends declared by us or other distributions with respect to our shares
until after the effective time of the merger and they have surrendered their
Guest Supply stock certificates to the exchange agent.
Any dividends declared by
us with a record date after the effective time of the merger will be accrued for
the benefit of those Guest Supply stockholders who have not yet surrendered
their certificates, and paid upon surrender.

     
Fractional Shares.  
No fractional shares of our common stock will be issued
upon the surrender of certificates representing Guest Supply shares.
Guest
Supply stockholders will not have any dividend, voting or other rights of a
SYSCO shareholder with respect to such fractional shares.
Instead, each Guest
Supply stockholder will receive an amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, equal to such fraction multiplied by the SYSCO average trading price or,
if applicable, the SYSCO average trading merger price, used in the offer or the
merger.
Guest Supply stockholders will not receive any interest on the cash to
be received for fractional shares, even if there is a delay in making the
exchange and payment.


GUEST SUPPLY BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Upon acceptance for exchange of Guest Supply shares in the offer, Guest
Supply will, subject to applicable law, cause to be placed on the Guest Supply
board of directors a number of directors designated by SYSCO.
We will be
entitled to designate that number of Guest Supply directors, rounded up to the

next whole number, such that the percentage of the total number of Guest Supply
directors designated by us will be equal to the percentage of total outstanding
Guest Supply shares then held by us.
However, following such designation and
until the merger has been completed, we and Guest Supply shall use best efforts
to ensure that the Guest Supply board of directors shall always have at least
two members who were directors of Guest Supply prior to the completion of the
offer.
The merger agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the
merger, if our designees are elected to the Guest Supply board, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the continuing Guest Supply directors will be required to:

     - amend or terminate the merger agreement;

     - exercise or waive any of Guest Supply's rights, benefits, or remedies
       under the merger agreement if such exercise or waiver materially and
       adversely affects Guest Supply stockholders other than us or Sysco Food
       Services of New Jersey;

     - take action with respect to the retention of counsel and other advisors
       in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
       or

     - approve any other action under or in connection with the merger agreement
       which materially and adversely affects the interests of Guest Supply
       stockholders, other than us or Sysco Food Services of New Jersey.


GUEST SUPPLY STOCK OPTIONS

     Stock Options.  
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Guest
Supply option shall be assumed by SYSCO and thereafter deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Guest Supply stock option, the same number of shares of SYSCO common stock as
the holder of the Guest Supply option would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement had the holder exercised the Guest Supply
option in full immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, rounded
down to the nearest whole number.
The price per share shall equal the per share
exercise price at which the Guest Supply option was exercisable immediately
prior to the effective time, divided by the exchange ratio.
All such options
shall automatically vest and become immediately exercisable upon the first to
occur of the commencement of the offer or 15 days prior to consummation of the
merger.

     
SYSCO has agreed to take all action necessary to implement the above,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of a sufficient number of shares
of SYSCO common stock for delivery upon exercise of these assumed options.
SYSCO
shall prepare and file a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a
post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement, with
respect to the shares of SYSCO common stock subject to the above options and,
where applicable, shall use its reasonable efforts to have the registration
statement declared effective as soon as is reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, to maintain its effectiveness and to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained in it for so long as the options
remain outstanding.

     
Guest Supply has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
individuals holding options under its 1993 Stock Option Plan to waive all of
their respective rights under Section 5(k) of such plan, which provides for the
issuance of reload options, effective from and after the date that our designees
constitute a majority of the members of the Guest Supply board of directors,
pursuant to a waiver agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
us.
As of January 31, 2001, holders of all options outstanding under this plan
have executed the waivers.

     
For more information on the treatment of Guest Supply stock options in
connection with the offer and the merger, please refer to Item 3 of Guest
Supply's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which was
mailed to Guest Supply stockholders together with a preliminary version of this
prospectus.


CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

directors, Guest Supply and its subsidiaries will carry on their respective

     - do any act or omit to do any act which would cause a material breach of
       any of its material contracts, commitments or obligations.


GUEST SUPPLY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

     If required by applicable law to effectuate the merger, the merger
agreement requires Guest Supply to call a meeting of its stockholders as soon as
practicable after the expiration or termination of the offer.
Guest Supply has
agreed that, through its board of directors and subject to the board's fiduciary
duties, it will recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of approving the
merger agreement.
At any such Guest Supply stockholder meeting, we have agreed
to vote all Guest Supply shares beneficially owned by us or any of our
subsidiaries in favor of approving the merger agreement.
If we or any of our
subsidiaries in the aggregate obtain at least 90% of the outstanding Guest
Supply shares, we have agreed to effect the merger as soon as practicable after
the expiration of the offer without a Guest Supply stockholders meeting pursuant
to Section 14A:10-5.1 of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act.


OTHER OFFERS

     The merger agreement provides that, from the date of the merger agreement
until the effective time of the merger or, if earlier, the termination of the
merger agreement, Guest Supply will not, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate, entertain, encourage or respond, except that it may
       respond to the contested proxy solicitation initiated by BFMA (which has
       publicly announced that it intends to withdraw its proxy solicitation)
       for Guest Supply's 2001 Annual Meeting of stockholders, to any inquiries
       or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to
       an alternative transaction, which means:

          - the acquisition of Guest Supply by merger or otherwise by any third
            party;

          - the acquisition by a third party of 20% or more of the assets of
            Guest Supply and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

          - the acquisition by a third party of 20% or more of the outstanding
            Guest Supply common stock or the issuance by Guest Supply of capital
            stock containing terms which are inconsistent with the consummation
            of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

          - the adoption by Guest Supply of a plan of liquidation or the
            declaration or payment by Guest Supply of an extraordinary dividend
            representing 20% or more of the value of Guest Supply and its
            subsidiaries taken as a whole; or

          - the repurchase by Guest Supply or any of its subsidiaries of more
            than 20% of its outstanding common stock;

     - negotiate, discuss or provide any non-public information to any third
       party in connection with an alternative transaction, or;

     - permit any subsidiary to, and will not authorize any officer, director,
       employee, any investment bank or other advisor or representative of it or
       a subsidiary to, and will instruct such persons not to, solicit, initiate
       or encourage the submission of a proposal for any alternative transaction
       or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
       information with respect to, or take action to facilitate, any
       alternative transaction or any inquiries or the making of any proposal
       that constitutes, or leads to, any alternative transaction; however, the
       Guest Supply board of directors may furnish information or enter into
       negotiations with, a third party that makes an unsolicited bona fide
       written proposal of an alternative transaction if, and only to the extent
       that:

          - the Guest Supply board of directors, after consultation with legal
            counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary for
            it to comply with its fiduciary duties,

          - the Guest Supply board of directors determines in good faith, after
            consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
            reputation, that such alternative transaction would, if consummated,
            constitute or be reasonably likely to constitute a superior
            proposal, which means any bona fide written unsolicited proposal of
            an alternative transaction, except that, for purposes of a superior
            proposal, 50% shall be substituted for 20%, that the Guest Supply
            board

of directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and consultation with
legal counsel, (i) would result in a transaction that would, if completed, be
      superior to the Guest Supply stockholders from a financial point of view
      as compared to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
      any alternative proposed by us in accordance with the merger agreement and
      (ii) to be reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its
      terms, including that any financing required to consummate the transaction
      contemplated by such proposal is capable of being, and is reasonably
      likely to be, obtained, in each case taking into account all factors the
      Guest Supply board of directors considers relevant, including all legal,
      financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal by the third
      party, and

          - prior to taking such action, Guest Supply provides notice to us to
            the effect that it is taking such action, including, without
            limitation, the material terms and conditions thereof and the
            identity of the person making it, and as promptly as practicable,
            but in no case later than 24 hours, after taking such action,
            provides us with a copy of any alternative transaction or amendments
            or supplements thereto and receives from such third party an
            executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and
            in any event containing terms at least as stringent as those between
            us and Guest Supply.

     
Subsequent to furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any third party, Guest Supply shall inform us on a prompt
basis of the status of any discussions or negotiations with such third party,
and any material changes to the terms and conditions of such alternative
transaction.
Promptly after the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
Guest Supply will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will instruct their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any possible
alternative transaction and shall notify each party with which it, or any
officer, director, investment advisor, financial advisor, attorney or other
representative retained by it, has had discussions during the 60 days prior to
the merger agreement, that the Guest Supply board of directors no longer seeks
to engage in any alternative transactions.

     
Under the merger agreement, Guest Supply has agreed that its board of
directors will not withdraw or modify or propose to withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of the merger agreement unless the board of directors
determines, after consultation with counsel, that it is required by its
fiduciary duties to do so.
Guest Supply has also agreed not to approve or
recommend an alternative transaction unless the following requirements are met:

     - the alternative transaction must be a superior proposal;

     - Guest Supply's board of directors must first consult with legal counsel
       and determine that such action is necessary for it to comply with its
       fiduciary duties to the Guest Supply stockholders;

     - Guest Supply must provide us with written notice advising us that Guest
       Supply has received a superior proposal, specifying the material terms
       and conditions of the superior proposal and identifying the person or
       entity making the superior proposal; and

     - Guest Supply's board of directors must allow two business days to elapse
       after we receive notice of the superior proposal without receiving from
       us an offer that would cause the Guest Supply board of directors to
       determine, after consulting with both a financial advisor of nationally
       recognized reputation and legal counsel, in its good faith judgment, that
       the alternative transaction is not a superior proposal to the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     
Guest Supply can terminate the merger agreement to pursue an alternative
transaction only after the second business day following our receipt of written
notice from Guest Supply advising us that its board of directors is prepared to
accept the superior proposal, and Guest Supply must pay us a termination fee.

See "-- Termination Events; Termination Fee; Expenses.
"

     No provision of the merger agreement prohibits Guest Supply from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from

making any disclosure to its stockholders which, in the good faith reasonable
judgment of the Guest Supply board of directors, based on the advice of legal
counsel, is required under applicable law.


DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

     
The merger agreement provides that, after the date of the merger agreement,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the corporation surviving the
merger will contain provisions that indemnify present or former directors,
officers, employees or agents of Guest Supply to at least the same extent as
they were indemnified prior to the date of the merger agreement.

     
We have agreed to maintain Guest Supply's current directors and officers
liability insurance and indemnification policies to the extent that they provide
coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the merger and to
provide similar coverage for a period of not less than six years from the
effective time of the merger for all persons who are directors and officers of
Guest Supply on the date of the merger agreement, provided that we will not be
obligated to pay an annual premium for any such coverage in excess of 150% of
the premium paid by Guest Supply for its most recent fiscal year, and our
aggregate indemnification liability may not exceed the net worth of Guest Supply
at December 29, 2000.

  obligations under the merger agreement;

     - by Guest Supply if, prior to the acceptance for payment of Guest Supply
       common stock under the offer, we materially breach any representation,

       or

     - by us if a triggering event shall have occurred, which means:

          alternative transaction;

          exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
          disclosing that Guest Supply recommends rejection of such tender or

We do not have the right to terminate the merger agreement as a result of
any action taken by Guest Supply or its agents in connection with the contested
proxy solicitation involving Guest Supply's 2001 Annual Meeting of stockholders
that is not in breach of any provision of the merger agreement.
However, on
January 23, 2001, following announcement of the execution of the merger

Supply announced that it intends to withdraw its proxy solicitation.

the date of the merger agreement to the effective time, reasonable access to its
officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records, files and other
documents as we may reasonably request that relate to the Guest Supply business.

Except as required by law, each party shall hold any confidential information in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement between SYSCO and Guest Supply.

     
Further Assurances.  
Each of the parties to the merger agreement has agreed
to execute and deliver any additional information, documents or agreements
contemplated by the merger agreement or necessary to complete the offer and the
merger.

                             
THE TENDER AGREEMENTS

PARTIES

     Certain directors and executive officers of Guest Supply who, on January
31, 2001, directly or indirectly, collectively held an aggregate of
approximately 8.35% of the outstanding shares of Guest Supply common stock and
collectively have the right to acquire an additional 472,500 shares upon the
exercise of outstanding Guest Supply stock options, have entered into tender
agreements with us.

AGREEMENTS TO TENDER

     Each Guest Supply stockholder who signed a tender agreement agreed to
tender in the offer and not withdraw all Guest Supply shares owned by him along
with any additional Guest Supply shares acquired by him after the date of the
tender agreement, including those acquired upon the exercise of options and

warrants.
Such stockholders have reserved the right to sell into the public
market up to 15% of the total number of (i) shares held of record, and (ii)
shares deemed beneficially owned by them pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Shares deemed beneficially owned include those
subject to options and warrants exercisable at January 22, 2001, and those
exercisable within 60 days thereafter.
They have also agreed that, if they do
not sell the remaining shares at least five days prior to the expiration date of
the offer, they will tender them in the offer.
As of February 26, 2001, they had
sold 82,500 shares.


PROXY

     Each Guest Supply stockholder who signed a tender agreement granted us, or
any of our nominees, a proxy to vote or execute a consent voting all of such
stockholder's Guest Supply shares:

     - in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement;

     - against any proposal for any recapitalization, merger, sale of assets or
       other business combination between Guest Supply and any person or entity,
       other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     - against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
       covenant, representation or warranty or would result in any other
       obligation or agreement of Guest Supply under the merger agreement not
       being fulfilled or would result in payment by Guest Supply of the
       termination fee set forth under "-- Termination Events; Termination Fee;
       Expenses"

NO SOLICITATION

     Each Guest Supply stockholder who signed a tender agreement further agreed
not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, entertain, encourage or
respond to any inquiries or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be
expected to lead to an alternative transaction to the offer or the merger with
another person or entity, or to negotiate, discuss or provide any non-public
information to any third party in connection with such an alternative
transaction.


TERMINATION

     Each tender agreement provides that it and the proxies granted under the
tender agreements will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

     - termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms;

     - the effective time of the merger;

     - the date on which all of the stockholder's Guest Supply shares are
       purchased pursuant to the offer; or

     - the termination of the offer without the purchase of any Guest Supply
shares.

                          
INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS

     
The information contained in Item 3 of the Schedule 14D-9 of Guest Supply
dated February 5, 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.
To our knowledge,
each material agreement, arrangement or understanding and any actual or
potential conflict of interest between Guest Supply and Guest Supply's executive
officers, directors or affiliates, or between Guest Supply and Sysco Food
Services of New Jersey, SYSCO and their respective executive officers, directors
or affiliates, is either incorporated herein by reference as a result of the
previous sentence or is set forth below.


EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement, we required
that the employment agreements of Clifford W. Stanley, Paul T. Xenis and R.
Eugene Biber be replaced with new employment agreements in order to help retain
these officers following the earlier to occur of the completion of the offer or
the merger.
These new agreements have terms that last until 90 days following
the end of our 2006 fiscal year and will become effective only upon the earlier
of completion of the offer or the merger, which we refer to as the effective
date of the agreement.
The agreements provide for initial base salaries of
$284,000 for Mr. Stanley, $210,000 for Mr. Xenis and $199,000 for Mr. Biber,
subject to annual review for merit increases.
On the effective date of the
agreement, Mr. Stanley will be granted stock options pursuant to our 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock which vest in
33 1/3% increments over three years on each anniversary date of the grant.
The
options may remain outstanding for 10 years from the date of grant so long as
during the first three years, following the effective date, his employment is
not terminated with cause and he does not resign (except for good reason).
The
term may be shortened based on the circumstances surrounding the termination of
his employment.
Messrs. Xenis and Biber will be granted stock options pursuant
to our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan to purchase 30,000 and 20,000 shares,
respectively, of our common stock which vest in 20% increments over five years
based upon achievement of targeted increases in pre-tax earnings of Guest Supply
compared to prior years, but if any such options do not vest because the targets
are not met, the options vest nine and one half years after the date of grant
provided that Mr. Xenis or Mr. Biber, as the case may be, is still employed by
Guest Supply.
Each of the options granted have special vesting provisions in the
event of and depending upon the reason why the employment agreements are
terminated.
Each of the agreements also provides for certain restrictive
covenants in favor of SYSCO, including noncompetition, nonsolicitation, and
nondisclosure of confidential information provisions.

     
This summary of the terms of the new employment agreements is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the text of the employment agreements, which are
filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part.

     
Pursuant to an agreement dated August 6, 1997, as amended, between Guest
Supply and Thomas M. Haythe, Mr. Haythe acts as general counsel for Guest
Supply.
The agreement provides for the payment of a monthly retainer of $7,500,
credited on a current basis against his fees for services rendered to Guest
Supply, and the payment of up to three years of such retainer upon the
termination of the agreement in the case of certain change-of-control events
involving Guest Supply.
The term of the agreement is for a three-year period
with automatic yearly extensions.
In connection with execution of the merger
agreement, Mr. Haythe entered into an amendment to the agreement with Guest
Supply which will take effect upon the closing of the offer or the merger.

Pursuant to the amendment, Mr. Haythe will continue to receive his monthly
retainer through July 2004.


STOCK OPTIONS

     As of January 31, 2001, options issued to executive officers and directors
of Guest Supply to purchase a total of 472,500 shares of Guest Supply common
stock, with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $8.54 per share,
were outstanding.


DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE; INDEMNIFICATION

     The merger agreement provides that for a period of six years from the
effective time of the merger, the corporation surviving the merger will maintain
in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons
who were covered under Guest Supply directors' and officers' liability insurance
on January 22, 2001.
Such insurance shall be no less favorable than Guest Supply
existing policies and shall cover events occurring prior to the effective time
of the merger.
We are not required to expend an amount in excess of 150% of the
annual premiums currently paid by Guest Supply for such insurance.

     
The surviving corporation of the merger will also indemnify each such
officer and director for a period of six years to the fullest extent that those
individuals are currently entitled to indemnification under New Jersey law and
under the Guest Supply certificate of incorporation and bylaws.


THE TENDER AGREEMENTS

     Immediately prior to the signing of the merger agreement, directors and
executive officers of Guest Supply, who then collectively held approximately
9.3% of the outstanding Guest Supply common stock, entered into tender
agreements with us.
Each Guest Supply stockholder who signed a tender agreement
all Guest Supply shares owned by them at January 22, 2001, as well as all
additional shares acquired by them, including those acquired upon exercise of
options and warrants.
However, each of those stockholders also reserved the
right to sell into the public market up to 15% of the total number of (i) shares
held of record, and (ii) shares deemed beneficially owned by such stockholders
pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Shares deemed
beneficially owned include those subject to options and warrants exercisable at
January 22, 2001, and those exercisable within 60 days thereafter.
Shares sold
pursuant to this provision on or before five days prior to the expiration date
of the offer will not be tendered.
As of February 1, 2001, approximately 8.35%
of the outstanding Guest Supply common stock was subject to the tender
agreements.

     
See "The Merger Agreement and the Tender Agreements -- The Tender
Agreements.

                    MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the merger to Guest Supply stockholders
who exchange their Guest Supply shares for our common shares pursuant to the
offer or the merger.
This discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis
or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant to the offer and the merger.

Further, this tax discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to Guest Supply stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances; nor does the discussion address the U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be applicable to Guest Supply stockholders
subject to special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (which we refer to as the Code), such as stockholders:

     - who are dealers in securities, traders that mark to market, foreign
       individuals (i.e., individuals who are not citizens or residents of the
       United States), foreign corporations, foreign partnerships or other
       foreign entities, mutual funds, financial institutions, insurance
       companies or tax-exempt entities;

     - who acquired their shares through the exercise of stock options, through
       stock purchase plans, in other compensatory transactions, or through a
       tax-qualified retirement plan;

     - whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes of Section
       1202 of the Code;

     - who hold their shares as part of an integrated investment such as a
       hedge, straddle, constructive sale or other risk reduction strategy or as
       part of a conversion transaction;

     - who do not hold their shares as capital assets;

     - whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or

     - who are subject to the alternative minimum tax.

     
In addition, the following tax discussion does not address the tax
consequences, if any, of the offer or the merger under state, local, foreign,
and other tax laws.
The tax opinions described below and this tax discussion are
based upon the provisions of the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, judicial
decisions and Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the IRS) rulings,
in each case, as in effect as of the date of this document.
There can be no
assurance that future legislative, judicial or administrative changes

or interpretations, which changes or interpretations could apply retroactively,
will not affect the accuracy of the statements or conclusions set forth in the
tax opinions summarized below or in this tax discussion.
No rulings have been or
will be sought from the IRS concerning the tax consequences of the offer and the
merger and neither this tax discussion nor the tax opinions described below will
be binding on the IRS or any court.
The IRS could adopt a contrary position, and
such contrary position could be sustained by a court.

     
SYSCO and Guest Supply expect to be advised by Arnall Golden Gregory LLP
and Torys, respectively, that in their respective opinions, although the matter
is not free from doubt, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the offer and the
merger should constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.
These tax opinions, when given, will be attached as Exhibits 8.1
and 8.2, respectively, to the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the
SEC, of which this prospectus is a part.
The tax opinions described above and
the consequences summarized below under "Federal Income Tax Consequences If The
Offer And The Merger Qualify As A Reorganization" will be conditioned upon,
among other things, all of the following factual assumptions (which we refer to
as the supporting conditions):

     - the merger is completed promptly after the offer; and

     - the offer and the merger are completed under the current terms of the
       merger agreement.

     
In addition to these primary supporting conditions, the opinions of Arnall
Golden Gregory LLP and Torys will rely upon, and the consequences summarized
below under "Federal Income Tax Consequences If The Offer And The Merger Qualify
As A Reorganization" are based upon, representations and covenants made by Guest
Supply and SYSCO, including those contained in tax representation letters of
Guest Supply, SYSCO and Sysco Food Services of New Jersey, and certain other
assumptions including the absence of changes in facts or in law between the date
of this prospectus and the effective time of the merger.
If any of those
representations, covenants or assumptions are inaccurate or if the supporting
conditions are not satisfied, the tax opinions of Arnall Golden Gregory LLP and
Torys described above cannot be relied upon.
In addition, the ability to satisfy
the supporting conditions, and therefore the federal income tax consequences of
the offer and the merger, depend in part on facts that will not be available
before the completion of the merger.
There can be no assurance that the merger
will be completed, or that the supporting conditions will be satisfied.
Also, as
noted above, it is possible that a court might reach a conclusion contrary to
the conclusion reached in the tax opinions.
Accordingly, it is possible that the
offer and/or the merger may not qualify as a reorganization, and the tax
consequences of the offer and/or the merger could differ materially from those
summarized below under "Federal Income Tax Consequences
If The Offer And The
Merger Qualify As A Reorganization."
See "Federal Income Tax Consequences If The
Offer
And/Or The Merger Does Not Qualify As A Reorganization.
"

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER QUALIFY AS A
REORGANIZATION

     Assuming that the offer and the merger qualify as a reorganization, and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications described above, for
federal income tax purposes:

     - A holder of Guest Supply shares will not recognize any gain or loss upon
       exchange of the holder's Guest Supply shares for SYSCO shares in the
       offer or the merger, except for cash received instead of a fractional
       share of SYSCO common stock.

     
- A holder of Guest Supply shares will have an aggregate tax basis in the
       SYSCO shares received in the offer or the merger equal to (1) the
       aggregate tax basis in the Guest Supply shares surrendered by that holder
       in the offer or merger, reduced by (2) any tax basis in such Guest Supply
       shares that is allocable to a fraction of a SYSCO common share for which
       cash is received.

     - The holding period for SYSCO shares received in exchange for Guest Supply
       shares in the offer or the merger will include the holding period for
       Guest Supply shares surrendered for them in the offer or the merger.


FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
IF THE OFFER AND/OR THE MERGER DOES NOT QUALIFY
AS A REORGANIZATION

     If the offer and/or the merger does not qualify as a reorganization, each
Guest Supply stockholder realizing gain on the exchange of Guest Supply shares
for SYSCO shares in the offer and/or the merger, as applicable, generally will
recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the fair
market value of the SYSCO shares received by such stockholder (together with any
cash received by such stockholder instead of a fraction of a SYSCO share) and
such stockholder's tax basis in the Guest Supply shares surrendered.
This
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such stockholder
held such Guest Supply shares for more than one year at the time such Guest
Supply shares are exchanged in the offer or at the effective time of the merger,
as applicable.

     
Guest Supply stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisor
regarding the recognition of gain or loss, and their basis and holding period in
the SYSCO shares if the offer and/or the merger does not qualify as a
reorganization.


FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED

     In addition to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described
above, this tax discussion does not address, and no opinion has been given
concerning, any tax consequences of the offer if the merger is not completed.
If
the merger is not completed, the federal income tax consequences of the exchange
of Guest Supply shares for SYSCO shares in the offer will depend on facts and
circumstances that are not yet known.
Such facts and circumstances include the
percentage of Guest Supply shares tendered in the offer.
You are urged to
consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences to you of your
participation in the offer if the merger is not completed.

     
The summary of anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences
set forth above is intended to provide only a general summary and is not
intended to be a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the merger.
In addition, the summary
does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on,
individual circumstances.
Moreover, the summary does not address any non-income
tax or any foreign, state, local or other tax consequences of the offer or the
merger.
The summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction
other than the offer and the merger.
Accordingly, each Guest Supply stockholder
is strongly urged to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular
federal, state, local or foreign income, reporting or other tax consequences of
the offer and the merger to such stockholder.

                    
COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SYSCO
                         SHARES AND GUEST SUPPLY SHARES

     
The rights of our stockholders are governed by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws.
The rights of
Guest Supply stockholders are governed by the New Jersey Business Corporation
Act and Guest Supply's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
Our certificate
of incorporation and bylaws differ from the Guest Supply certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in several respects.
Upon completion of the merger,
Guest Supply stockholders will become SYSCO stockholders and their rights will
become subject to the provisions of Delaware law and the SYSCO certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.
The material differences between the rights of Guest
Supply stockholders and SYSCO stockholders are summarized below.

     
The following discussion is not intended to be complete.
You should also
refer to Delaware corporate law, our certificate of incorporation and our
bylaws.
Copies of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws,

the Guest Supply certificate of incorporation and the Guest Supply bylaws will
be sent to the stockholders of Guest Supply upon request.

SYSCO RIGHTS PLAN

     Under SYSCO's Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, as amended in May
1999, each share of SYSCO common stock has attached to it one-half of one
preferred stock purchase right.
Each right entitles the holder to purchase from
SYSCO one two-thousandth of a share of SYSCO's Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a price of $175 per one two-thousandth of a share.

     
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier to occur of:

     - a public announcement that, without the prior consent of the board of
       directors of SYSCO, a person or group has acquired or obtained the right
       to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares
       of SYSCO common stock; or

     - ten business days, or such later date as the board may determine,
       following the commencement or announcement of an intention, which is not
       subsequently withdrawn, to make a tender offer or exchange offer which
       would result in any person or group having beneficial ownership of 10% or
       more of the outstanding shares of SYSCO common stock without the prior
       consent of the board of directors.

     
Upon the occurrence of either of the events described above, each holder of
a right will have a 60-day period (or a longer period set by the board of
directors) to exercise a right to receive securities.
The 60-day (or longer)
period will begin on the later of:

     - the date of this occurrence; or

     - the effective date of any required registration statement.

     
Upon exercise of this right, each holder will receive that number of units
of one two-thousandths of a share of preferred stock, or, in some cases, common
stock or other securities, having an average market value during a specified
time period of two times the exercise price of the right.

     
In addition, if SYSCO is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction or 50% or more of SYSCO's assets or earning power is sold, each
right will entitle the holder to receive, upon the exercise of the right, that
number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value
of two times the exercise price of the right.

     
Prior to there being an occurrence described above, SYSCO may redeem the
rights at a price of $0.01 per right.
The rights will expire on May 31, 2006,
unless earlier redeemed by SYSCO.

     
The rights have certain anti-takeover effects.
Because an acquiring person
or group is not entitled to exercise purchase rights that relate to its shares,
the acquiring person's or group's ownership of SYSCO would be severely diluted
if the other stockholders exercise their rights to purchase the preferred stock,

which has preferential dividends, liquidation, voting and other rights.

Therefore, the effect of the rights agreement is to encourage any person or
group who wants to acquire SYSCO to negotiate with the SYSCO board to agree on
the terms of the transaction.
However, the rights generally should not interfere
with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of
directors.


GUEST SUPPLY RIGHTS PLAN

     On July 14, 1988, as amended on August 6, 1997, the Board of Directors of
Guest Supply declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of common stock of Guest Supply and for each share of common
stock issued from that date.
The dividend was payable on July 26, 1988 to the
stockholders of record on that date.
Each right entitles the registered holder
to purchase from Guest Supply one one-hundredth of a preferred share at a price
of $30.00, subject to adjustment.

     
The rights agreement provides that, until the earlier to occur of (i) 10
days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
outstanding common stock, or (ii) 10 days following the commencement or
announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the
completion of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or
group of 20% or more of such outstanding common stock, the rights will be
transferred with and only with the common stock.

     
Each holder of a right will in such event have the right to receive shares
of Guest Supply's common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
price of the right, which has been set at $30.00; and in the event that Guest
Supply is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or if more than
50% of its assets or earning power is sold, each holder of a right would have
the right to receive common stock of the acquiring company with a market value
of two times the exercise price of the right.
Following the occurrence of any of
these events, any rights that are beneficially owned by any acquiring person
will immediately become null and void.

     
The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of such date as described
above and will expire on July 15, 2008, unless the final expiration date is
extended or the rights are earlier redeemed by Guest Supply at $.01 per right.

Guest Supply's Board of Directors has taken sufficient action to exempt the
offer, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from
the provisions of the rights plan.

                                 
LEGAL MATTERS

     
The legality of the shares of SYSCO common stock to be issued in the merger
will be passed upon for SYSCO by Arnall Golden Gregory LLP.
Jonathan Golden, a
partner of Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, is a director of SYSCO.
As of January 31,
2001, attorneys with Arnall Golden Gregory LLP beneficially owned an aggregate
of approximately 160,000 shares of SYSCO common stock.
Arnall Golden Gregory LLP
and Torys will deliver their opinions to SYSCO and Guest Supply, respectively,
as to certain federal income tax consequences of the merger.

     The consolidated balance sheets of SYSCO Corporation and subsidiaries as of
July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999, and the related statements of consolidated
results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows and financial
statement schedule for each of the three years in the period ended July 1, 2000,
incorporated by reference in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration
statement have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public
accountants, as indicated in their report with respect thereto, and are
incorporated herein in reliance upon the authority of said firm as experts in
giving said report.

     
With respect to the unaudited interim financial information of SYSCO
Corporation and subsidiaries for the quarters ended December 30, 2000 and
January 1, 2000 incorporated herein by reference, Arthur Andersen LLP has
applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a
review of that information.
However, their separate report thereon states that
they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial
information.
Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on that
information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review
procedures applied.
In addition, the accountants are not subject to the
liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their
reports on the unaudited interim information because that report is not a
"report" or a "part" of the registration statement prepared or certified by the
accountants within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Act.

     
The consolidated financial statements and the related financial statement
schedule of Guest Supply, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 29, 2000 and
October 1, 1999, and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
September 29, 2000, have been incorporated by reference herein and in the
registration statement in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP, independent
certified public accountants, incorporated by reference herein, and upon the
authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

A-1

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

                              THE OFFER AND MERGER

     1.1  The Offer; Merger Election.  
(a) Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and none of the events
set forth in Annex A hereto shall be existing (other than paragraphs (g), (i)
and (k) therein), Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof,
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))
the Offer.
Each Share accepted by Merger
Sub in accordance with the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive
from Merger Sub the consideration determined in accordance with Section 1.2(A)
below (collectively, the "Offer Consideration").
The Offer shall be subject to
the condition that there be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer such number of Shares which, when added to the Shares,
if any, beneficially owned by Sysco or Merger Sub, would constitute a majority
of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (the "Minimum Condition") and
to the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (any of which may be waived
in whole or in part by Merger Sub in its sole discretion except as otherwise
provided herein).
Sysco and Merger Sub shall comply with the obligations
respecting prompt payment and announcement under the Exchange Act, and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including but not limited to the conditions of the Offer, Merger
Sub shall, and Sysco shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after expiration
thereof.
The obligations of Merger Sub to consummate the Offer and to accept for
payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the expiration
of the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject only to the conditions set forth
in Annex A hereto.
Each of Sysco and Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to
waive the conditions of the Offer and to amend any of the terms and conditions
of the Offer; provided, that Merger Sub shall not without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent to be authorized by the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Company Board") or a duly authorized committee thereof) (i)
decrease the Offer Consideration, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought,
(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer as set
forth in Section 1.2 below, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to
those set forth in Annex A hereto, (v) amend any other term or condition of the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the Shares, (vi) extend the
expiration date of the Offer, or (vii) waive the Minimum Condition or the
conditions set forth in subsection (f) or (h) of Annex A. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, (A) extend the
Offer, if at the initial scheduled or any extended expiration date of the Offer
any of the conditions of the Offer shall not be satisfied or waived, until such
time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer, (C) extend the Offer for up to twenty (20)
business days if there have not been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
the expiration of the Offer such number of Shares that, together with Shares, if
any, beneficially owned by Sysco or Merger Sub, would constitute at least 90% of
the fully diluted Shares as of the date of determination, provided that all
other conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived and (D) extend the Offer
for any reason for up to five (5) business days; provided, that no more than
three extensions in the aggregate shall be permitted under clauses (C) and (D)
of this sentence; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 and, subject to
Section 1.1(c), Merger Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time in the event
that, at a then-scheduled expiration date, all of the conditions to the Offer
have not been satisfied or waived as permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each
such extension not to exceed the lesser of ten (10) additional business days or
such fewer number of days that Merger Sub reasonably believes is necessary to
permit the conditions to the Offer to be satisfied.
In addition, the Offer
Consideration may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent
required by law, in each case

                                       A-2

without the consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision herein to the contrary, in the event that the Minimum Condition has
been satisfied and all other conditions set forth in Annex A have been satisfied
or waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Sysco shall cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and not
withdrawn as soon as practicable after the date that all such conditions have
been satisfied or waived, and nothing herein shall prohibit Merger Sub from
making a subsequent offer for Shares not so purchased upon the consummation of
the Offer subject to and in compliance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act (a
"Subsequent Offer").

     (b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Sysco shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), to register the offer
and sale of Sysco Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and any Subsequent Offer
(the "Form S-4").
The Form S-4 will include a preliminary prospectus containing
the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(the "Preliminary Prospectus").
As soon as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, Sysco and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer and any
Subsequent Offer (the "Schedule TO") which will contain or incorporate by
reference all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus and form of the related
letter of transmittal (together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
collectively the "Offer Documents") and (ii) subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 1.3(c), cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares.
Sysco, Merger Sub and the Company each agree promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect.
Sysco and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected, and any other filings or documents, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Sysco further agrees
that it shall cause the Offer Documents, Form S-4, and any other documents filed
with the SEC, to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, and the
rules and regulations thereunder, and other applicable laws.
The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule TO, the Form S-4 and the Offer Documents prior to its being filed with
the SEC.
In addition, Sysco agrees to provide the Company and its counsel in
writing with any comments, whether written or oral, that Sysco or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO, the Form S-4 and the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments or other communications.

     
(c) If, on April 30, 2001 (the "Final Expiration Date"), Merger Sub has not
consummated the Offer in accordance with its terms, Merger Sub shall thereupon
terminate the Offer (in accordance with all applicable laws) without the
acceptance of any Shares previously tendered.
If, at the Final Expiration Date,
the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, Merger Sub shall, unless Sysco and
the Company otherwise agree, terminate the Offer, and the parties shall, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof in accordance with all applicable laws, use
all commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger unless the
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(h).

     
(d)
In the event that this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, Merger Sub shall, and Sysco shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
terminate the Offer (in accordance with all applicable laws) without accepting
any Shares for payment or exchange.

     
1.2(A)
Offer Consideration.  
The consideration per Share due to each holder
of Common Stock (a "Stockholder") in connection with the Offer (and any
Subsequent Offer) is the "Offer Consideration" and shall be payable by Sysco in
the form of shares of Sysco Common Stock as provided in subsection (a) below.

          
(a)
In connection with the Offer (and any Subsequent Offer), the
     number of shares of Sysco Common Stock which each Stockholder is entitled
     to receive, and which Sysco shall issue, for each Share owned by a
     Stockholder shall be determined by dividing $26.00 by the Average Sysco
     Offer Price (as defined in Section 1.2(A)(b) below).

                                       
A-3

          (b) The "Average Sysco Offer Price" means the average of the closing
     prices of the Sysco Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
     Reporting Tape (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported
     therein, any other authoritative source) on the fifteen (15) trading days
     ending on the date (the "Offer Determination Date") which is five (5)
     trading days immediately preceding the expiration date of the Offer as it
     may from time to time be extended in accordance with this Agreement;
     provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (x)
     such average is less than $22.00, then the Average Sysco Offer Price shall
     be $22.00 and (y) such average is more than $30.00, then the Average Sysco
     Offer Price shall be $30.00.

     (B) Merger Consideration Upon Termination of Offer.  
In the event that the
Offer has been terminated pursuant to Section 1.1(c) and the Agreement has not
been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the parties shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
The consideration per Share due to each Stockholder in connection
with the Merger is the "Merger Consideration" and shall be payable as set forth
in subsection (a) below.
The Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders in
connection with the Merger upon such termination of the Offer shall be payable
by Sysco in the form of shares of Sysco Common Stock.

          
(a)
In the event that the Offer has been terminated pursuant to
     Section 1.1(c), in connection with the Merger the number of shares of Sysco
     Common Stock which each Stockholder is entitled to receive, and which Sysco
     shall issue, for each Share owned by a Stockholder shall be determined by
     dividing $26.00 by the Average Sysco Merger Price (as defined in Section
     1.2(B)(b) below).

          
(b) The "Average Sysco Merger Price" means the average of the closing
     prices of the Sysco Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
     Reporting Tape (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported
     therein, any other authoritative source) on the fifteen (15) trading days
     ending on the date (the "Merger Determination Date") which is five (5)
     trading days immediately preceding the date of the Stockholders Meeting (as
     defined in Section 1.12) for the Merger following a termination of the
     Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(c); provided, however, notwithstanding the
     foregoing, in the event that (x) such average is less than $22.00, then the
     Average Sysco Merger Price shall be $22.00 and (y) such average is more
     than $30.00, then the Average Sysco Merger Price shall be $30.00.
The
     Average Sysco Merger Price shall be used in determining Merger
     Consideration payable in connection with the Merger following the
     termination of the Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(c) and for no other
     purpose.

     (C) Merger Consideration Upon Consummation of Offer.  
In the event that
Merger Sub accepts for payment any Shares in the Offer, the parties shall
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders in connection with the Merger
shall be payable by Sysco in the same form and same amount as the Offer
Consideration and there shall be no calculation of the Average Sysco Merger
Price.

     1.3  Company Actions.

     
(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are advisable and are fair to and in the best interest of
the Stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

all steps, at the proper time in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Offer and the Merger, necessary to comply

the Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby, do not constitute a
"takeover bid" under the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act (NJSA 14A:10A-1
et seq.)
and the New Jersey Corporation Takeover Bid Disclosure Law (NJSA 49:5-1
et seq.)
(collectively, the "New Jersey Takeover Acts"), including, without
limitation, taking the steps contemplated by the proviso in Section 4.28 hereof,
(iv) taken all steps necessary to exempt the Offer (and any Subsequent Offer),
the Merger and this Agreement from the Rights Agreement (as defined in Section
4.5), and (v) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer

                                       A-4

(and any Subsequent Offer) and approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Stockholders (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iv)
are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Company
Recommendations").

     (b) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the
Company Recommendations, subject to the provisions of Section 7.1.
At the time
the Offer Documents are first mailed to the Stockholders, the Company shall mail
or cause to be mailed to the Stockholders such Schedule 14D-9 together with such
Offer Documents.
The Company further agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, and other applicable laws.
The Company further
agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws.
Each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Sysco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false and misleading in any material respect and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.
Sysco and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC.
In addition, the
Company agrees to provide Sysco, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with
any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments or other communications.

     
(c)
In connection with the Offer (and any Subsequent Offer) and the Merger,
the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub
mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as
of a recent date, and shall furnish Merger Sub with such information and
assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer (and any Subsequent Offer) to the Stockholders.
Except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents, Sysco and Merger Sub shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists and
the additional information referred to in the preceding sentence, will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this
Agreement is terminated, will upon request of the Company deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company all copies of such information then in its possession
or the possession of its agents or representatives.

     1.4  Directors.

     
(a) Subject to compliance with the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the
"NJBCA"), the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law,
promptly upon the payment for Shares by Merger Sub which represent at least a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
the Company shall, at the request of Sysco, promptly use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to cause the Company Board to
include such number of directors designated by Sysco, rounded up to the next
whole number, as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to the directors designated by Sysco pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Merger Sub, Sysco and any of their affiliates (including
Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding, including by accepting the resignations of such number
of its incumbent directors as is necessary to enable Sysco's designees to be
elected or appointed.
At such times, the Company will cause individuals
designated by Sysco to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the nearest
whole number) as such individuals represent on the Company Board of (A) each
committee of the Company Board and (B) each board of directors (and committee
thereof) of each Company Subsidiary in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable law or the rules or applicable listing agreement of any stock
exchange or over-the-counter market on which the Common Stock is listed or

                                       A-5

traded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.7 hereof), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to retain as members of the Company Board at least two directors that are
directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "Independent Directors").
The
Company's obligations under this Section 1.4(a) shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.
The Company
shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 all
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, required
pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule l4f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.4(a), including mailing to Stockholders the
information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Sysco's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board.
Sysco
or Merger Sub shall supply the Company any information with respect to either of
them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
The provisions of this Section 1.4 are in addition
to and shall not limit any rights which Merger Sub, Sysco or any of their
Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law
with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

     (b) In the event that Sysco's designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board as aforesaid, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain as members of the Company Board at
least two directors who are Independent Directors, provided that, in such event,
if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director, if any, shall be entitled to
designate a person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent
Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies
who shall not be stockholders, Affiliates or associates of Sysco or Merger Sub,
and each such person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director, for purposes
of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event that Sysco's designees constitute a majority of the directors on
the Company Board (the effective date on which Sysco's designees constitute such
a majority shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Control Date"), the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required
after the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to
the Effective Time, to (a) amend or terminate this Agreement by the Company, (b)
exercise or waive any of the Company's rights, benefits or remedies hereunder if
such exercise or waiver materially and adversely affects holders of Shares other
than Sysco or Merger Sub, (c) take action with respect to the retention of
counsel and other advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (d) take any other action under or in connection with this Agreement
if such action materially and adversely affects holders of Shares other than
Sysco or Merger Sub; provided, that if there shall be no such directors, such
actions may be effected by unanimous vote of the entire Company Board.
The
Independent Directors shall have the right to retain, at the expense of the
Company, one separate firm of counsel and one investment banking firm to
represent them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

     
1.5  The Merger.  
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

ARTICLE 2

                       OPTIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     2.1  Stock Options.  
(a)
At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") issued pursuant to
any of the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by
Sysco.
Each Company Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
Stock Option, (i) the same number of whole shares of Sysco Common Stock as the
holder of such Company Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant
to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the
number of whole shares of Sysco Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such
Company Stock Option; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Stock
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options"), the option price, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such Company Stock Option shall be determined in
order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.
As used herein, the term,
"Company Stock Plan," shall mean and refer to (as the context requires) any of
the Company's: (i) 1983 Stock Option Plan, (ii) 1993 Stock Option Plan and (iii)

                                       A-8

Long Term Incentive Plan, and the term "Company Stock Plans," shall mean and
refer to all of such Plans collectively.

     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Sysco shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders' rights with respect to such Company Stock Options pursuant to the
applicable Company Stock Plan and the certificates evidencing the grants of such
Company Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by Section 2.1(a) after giving effect to
the Merger and the assumption by Sysco as set forth above).
Sysco shall comply
with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure, to the extent required by, and
subject to the provisions of, such Plan, that Company Stock Options which
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options of Sysco after the Effective Time.

     (c) Sysco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Sysco Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Company Stock Options assumed by it in accordance with Section 2.1(a).
As
soon as practicable, but in no event more than 20 days, after the Effective
Time, Sysco shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Sysco Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Options assumed by Sysco as aforesaid, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses referred to therein) for so long as
such Company Stock Options remain outstanding.

     
(d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
individuals holding options under the Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan to waive
all of their respective rights under Section 5(k) of such plan effective from
and after the Control Date pursuant to a waiver agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Sysco.

     2.2  Fractional Shares.  
No fractional shares of Sysco Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger or the Offer.
If a fractional share results from the
calculations set forth in Section 1.2, a Stockholder shall receive an amount in
cash in lieu of such fractional share, equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Average Sysco Offer Price or, if the Offer has been terminated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Average Sysco Merger Price.

     2.3  Effect on Capital Stock.  
As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Sysco, Merger Sub, Guest Supply or
the Stockholders:

          (a) Conversion of Common Stock.  
Each issued and outstanding share of
     Common Stock shall be converted into solely the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger and,
     each share of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
     Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
     right to receive the Merger Consideration.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock.  
Each share of Common Stock held
     in the treasury of the Company shall automatically be cancelled and
     extinguished and no Merger Consideration shall be paid with respect
     thereto.

          (c) Merger Sub Common Stock.  
Each share of common stock, par value
     $.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
     the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of newly issued Common
     Stock and shall remain outstanding as a validly issued, fully paid and
     non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (d) Sysco Common Stock.  
At and after the Effective Time, each share
     of Sysco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be
     affected by the Merger.

     2.4  Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent.  
As of the Effective Time, Sysco shall enter into an
agreement with Sysco's transfer agent or such other bank or trust company as may
be designated by Sysco and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") which shall provide that Sysco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as
of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Stockholders, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 2.4 through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Sysco Common Stock to be issued as the Merger
Consideration (such shares of Sysco Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time
or cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Sysco Common Stock are
collectively the "Exchange Fund").

     (b) Exchange Procedures.

          
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
     Exchange Agent shall mail to each Stockholder (A) a letter of transmittal
     ("Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
     effected, and risk of loss of the Common Stock shall pass, only upon
     delivery to the Exchange Agent of the certificates representing same
     (collectively, the "Certificates"), and shall be in such form and have such
     other provisions as Sysco and the Company may reasonably specify) and (B)
     instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the
     Merger Consideration.

          (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
     Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such
     other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
     holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Sysco
     Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
     provisions of Section 1.2 and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Sysco
     Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2 and the Certificates so
     surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

          
(iii) If a surrendered Certificate is not registered in the transfer
     records of the Company under the name of the person surrendering such
     Certificate, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to the surrendering
     person only if such Certificate has been properly endorsed for transfer and
     the surrendering person pays any applicable transfer or other Taxes.

          
(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), each
     Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
     represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
     Consideration.

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
With respect to any
unsurrendered Certificate, any interest, dividends or other distributions
otherwise payable to the holder therefor shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.4.
Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of
the Certificate: (i) a certificate representing whole shares of Sysco Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) the amount of dividends or other
distributions without interest, with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Sysco Common Stock, and
(iii) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Sysco
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled.

     
(d) Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock.
All shares of Sysco Common
Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.4 shall be deemed in full
satisfaction of all rights of the Stockholders pertaining to the shares of
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Common Stock other than pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Sysco, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.4, except as otherwise provided by law.

                                       
A-10

     (e) Termination of Exchange Fund.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Sysco, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.4 shall
thereafter look only to Sysco for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration.

     (f) No Liability; Escheat.
None of the Company, Sysco, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Sysco Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Sysco Common Stock or any
other cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     
(g) Investment of Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Sysco, on a daily basis.
Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Sysco.

     (h) Lost Certificates.
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue and pay to such person in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

     2.5  Adjustment.
If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, as the case may be, (i) the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Sysco
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any classification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, or readjustment or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or (ii) the Company
shall have issued additional shares of Common Stock (other than upon the
exercise or conversion of stock options, warrants or other convertible
securities issued or granted prior to the date hereof) or Options or warrants to
purchase the same, or securities convertible into the same, the number of shares
of Sysco Common Stock issued as Offer Consideration or Merger Consideration, as
the case may be, shall be adjusted to accurately reflect such change (it being
acknowledged that the Company elsewhere herein covenants not to take any of the
actions described in (i) or (ii) above).

     
2.6  Shares of Sysco Common Stock.
The shares of Sysco Common Stock
delivered as the Offer Consideration or Merger Consideration, as the case may
be, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Sysco Shares."
The Sysco
Shares when issued to Stockholders shall be registered under the Securities Act
and shall contain no restrictions by Sysco or Merger Sub other than, as to
certain Affiliates, pursuant to Rules 144 and 145 of the Securities Act.

3.5  No Negotiations.  
The Company hereby agrees that neither Guest Supply
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
representatives or agents shall, directly or indirectly:

          (i) solicit, initiate, entertain, encourage or respond to any
     inquiries or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be expected to
     lead to an Alternative Transaction, as defined below; provided, however,
     the Company shall not be in breach of this Section 3.5 for responses (but
     not to an Alternative Transaction) relating to the contested proxy
     solicitation initiated by BFMA Holding Corporation for the Company's 2001
     Annual Meeting of Stockholders, so long as the Company does not breach the
     covenants of the fourth sentence of Section 3.8; or

          (ii) negotiate, discuss or provide any non-public information to any
     third party in connection with an Alternative Transaction; or

          (iii) from and after the date hereof until the termination of this
     Agreement and except as expressly permitted by the following provisions of
     this Section 3.5, permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and will not authorize
     any officer, director or employee of or any investment banker, attorney,
     accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to (and will instruct such persons not to), directly or
     indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of a proposal
     for any Alternative Transaction (as hereinafter defined) or (ii)
     participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
     person (which includes a "person" as such term is defined in Section
     13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (a "Third Party") other than Sysco, Merger
     Sub or any affiliate thereof any information with respect to, or take any
     other action knowingly to facilitate, any Alternative Transaction or any
     inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
     be expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction; provided, however,
     that nothing contained in this Section 3.5(iii) or in Sections 3.5(i) or
     3.5(ii) shall prohibit the Company Board from furnishing information to, or
     entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party that makes
     an unsolicited bona fide written proposal of an Alternative Transaction if,
     and only to the extent that (A) the Company Board, after consultation with
     legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary for
     the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders
     under applicable law, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
     consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
     that such Alternative
                                       A-14

     Transaction would, if consummated, constitute or be reasonably likely to
     constitute a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and (C) prior to
     taking such action, the Company (x) provides notice to Sysco to the effect
     that it is taking such action (including, without limitation, the material
     terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making it) as
     promptly as practicable (but in no case later than 24 hours) after taking
     such action, (y) provides Sysco with a copy of any Alternative Transaction
     or amendments or supplements thereto and (z) receives from such Third Party
     an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and in
     any event containing terms at least as stringent as those between Sysco and
     the Company.
Subsequent to furnishing information to, or entering into
     discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party in accordance with this
     Section 3.5, the Company shall inform Sysco on a prompt basis of the status
     of any discussions or negotiations with such Third Party, and any material
     changes to the terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction.
     
Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
     will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will instruct their
     respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
     accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing
     activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
     heretofore with respect to any possible Alternative Transaction and shall
     notify each party that it, or any officer, director, investment advisor,
     financial advisor, attorney or other representative retained by it, has had
     discussions with during the 60 days prior to the date of this Agreement
     that the Company Board no longer seeks the making of any Alternative
     Transaction.

          (iv) (x) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
     manner adverse to Sysco, the Company Recommendations or (y) approve or
     recommend an Alternative Transaction unless the Company Board, after
     consultation with legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action
     is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to
     the Stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, the Company Board
     may not approve or recommend (and in connection therewith, withdraw or
     modify the Company Recommendations) an Alternative Transaction unless (i)
     such Alternative Transaction is a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company Board
     shall have first consulted with legal counsel and have determined that such
     action is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
     duties to the Stockholders, (iii) the Company Board has provided written
     notice to Sysco (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Sysco that the
     Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material
     terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person
     making such Superior Proposal, and (iv) two business days have elapsed
     after Sysco's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal and Sysco has not
     made an offer such that the Company Board determines in its good faith
     judgment (after consultation with a financial adviser of nationally
     recognized reputation and consultation with legal counsel) that the
     Alternative Transaction is not a Superior Proposal.
If Sysco makes an offer
     as contemplated by clause (iv) of the preceding sentence, upon the
     Company's request Sysco shall execute an amendment to this Agreement to
     implement the terms contemplated by such offer.

          
Nothing contained in this Section 3.5 shall prohibit the Company from
     taking and disclosing to the Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
     14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure
     to the Stockholders which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the
     Company Board, after consultation with legal counsel, is required under
     applicable law; provided, that except as otherwise permitted in this
     Section 3.5, the Company shall not withdraw or modify, or propose to
     withdraw or modify, the Company Recommendations or approve or recommend, or
     propose to approve or recommend, an Alternative Transaction.
     
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
     action by the Company Board permitted by, and taken in accordance with,
     this Section 3.5 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
     Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but
     subject to the proviso contained in the first sentence of Section 3.5(iii)
     hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall (x) limit the Company Board's
     ability to make any disclosure to the Stockholders that the Company Board
     determines in good faith (after consultation with legal counsel) is
     required to be made to satisfy its fiduciary duties under applicable law or
     (y) limit the Company's ability to make any disclosure required by
     applicable law, and such actions shall not be considered a breach of this
     Agreement.
                                       
A-15

          (v)
For all purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction"
     means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the acquisition of
     the Company by merger or otherwise by any Third Party, (ii) the acquisition
     by a Third Party of 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of
     20% or more of the outstanding Shares or the issuance by the Company of
     capital stock containing terms which are inconsistent with the consummation
     of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the adoption by
     the Company of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or payment by the
     Company of an extraordinary dividend representing 20% or more of the value
     of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (v) the repurchase
     by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of more than 20% of the
     outstanding Shares.

          
For all purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any
     bona fide written unsolicited proposal of an Alternative Transaction
     (except that, for purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, 50%
     shall be substituted for 20% wherever it appears in the definition of
     Alternative Transaction) that the Company Board determines in its good
     faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
     recognized reputation and consultation with legal counsel) (i) would result
     in a transaction, if consummated, that would be superior to the
     Stockholders from a financial point of view as compared to the transactions
     contemplated hereby and any alternative proposed by Sysco or Merger Sub in
     accordance with Section 3.5(iv) and (ii) to be reasonably capable of being
     consummated in accordance with its terms (including that any financing
     required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such proposal is
     capable of being, and is reasonably likely to be, obtained), in each case
     taking into account all factors the Company Board considers relevant,
     including all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
     proposal by the Third Party.
Any change in the terms of an Alternative
     Transaction shall be deemed to constitute a new Alternative Transaction
     hereunder, subject to all of the applicable provisions of this Section 3.5.

          
The Company shall notify Sysco promptly if it or, to its knowledge,
     any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
     Stockholders, representatives, agents, or Affiliates receives any
     indications of interest, requests for non-public information or offers in
     respect of an Alternative Transaction, and will communicate to Sysco in
     reasonable detail the terms of any such indication, request or proposal,
     and will provide Sysco with copies of all written communications relating
     to any such indication, request or proposal.
The Company represents that it
     is not party to or bound by any agreement with respect to an Alternative
     Transaction other than this Agreement.

     however, that the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not include any
     change or effect to the extent attributable to the matters set forth on
     Schedule 3.7.
Sysco's knowledge of any facts obtained by Sysco prior to the

Company as of the date hereof, which provisions (along with all provisions
regarding indemnification or exculpation from liability contained in the

subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, and liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, to
which any of them was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by
reason of the fact that he or she was or is a director or officer of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time to the fullest extent that the Company or such subsidiary
would have been permitted to indemnify such Person under applicable law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or such subsidiary in
effect on the date hereof, provided, however; that the aggregate indemnification
liability of Sysco pursuant to this Section 3.15 shall not exceed the

less favorable than those contained in such policy as in effect on the date
hereof; (ii) purchase tail insurance in respect of the Company's existing D&O
Insurance for six (6) years for a premium not to exceed the amount of the
customary premium for such tail insurance, or (iii) if such D&O Insurance or
tail insurance is only available at premiums in excess of the premiums currently
paid by the Company for its existing D&O Insurance, then purchase the highest
level of D&O Insurance or tail insurance available for an amount equal to 150%
of such annual premium.

     
(c) Any person who is entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.15
(an "Indemnified Party") wishing to claim such indemnification, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, shall promptly
notify Sysco thereof, but failure to so notify will not relieve Sysco of
liability except to the extent Sysco is materially adversely affected thereby.

In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Sysco or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, and Sysco shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently
                                       A-19

incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Sysco or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that, in such counsel's
reasonable judgment, there are issues that constitute conflicts of interest
between Sysco or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Sysco and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;
provided that, Sysco shall be obligated pursuant to this subsection (c) to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) Sysco shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent; and provided further that, Sysco shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.
The
rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 3.15 are in addition to any
rights they may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation or under
any indemnification agreement with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

     
(d) Sysco agrees that if the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other person or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person or entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 3.15.

     
(e) The provisions of this Section 3.15 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the present and former directors,
officers, employees, and agents, their representatives.
