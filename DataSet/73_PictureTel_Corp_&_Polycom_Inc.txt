BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER    

    
In the summer of 1999, Bruce Bond, then Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PictureTel, and other executive officers of PictureTel met with
Robert Hagerty, Polycom's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Kourey, Polycom's Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer and other executive
officers of Polycom in Chicago to discuss a potential business combination transaction between the two companies.
However, the companies were unable to agree on terms and no transaction resulted from
these discussions. 

    
In
early 2000, Mr. Hagerty met with Norman Gaut, PictureTel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in Boston to discuss Polycom's interest in purchasing PictureTel's
videoconferencing products division.
However, no transaction resulted from these discussions. 

    
In
December 2000, Mr. Hagerty met with Lewis Jaffe, PictureTel's President and Chief Operating Officer, at a trade show in Anaheim, California where they discussed the
topic of a potential business combination transaction between the two companies.
Following that meeting, Mr. Hagerty and Jules DeVigne, an Executive Vice President of Polycom, engaged in
several telephone conversations with Mr. Jaffe to discuss a potential business combination between the two companies. 

    
In
late 2000 and early 2001, PictureTel determined, in light of its history of losses, financial condition and current market conditions, that it should consider potential strategic
initiatives to enhance shareholder value, including a merger or other business combination.
In connection with these efforts, PictureTel engaged Robertson Stephens to act as its financial advisor.

During this period, approximately 25 parties, which PictureTel believed were the most likely potential purchasers of PictureTel, were contacted on behalf of PictureTel to solicit their interest in a
possible transaction with PictureTel.
Of the parties contacted, only two parties, Polycom and another potential purchaser, the alternative purchaser, eventually submitted written acquisition proposals
to PictureTel.
PictureTel entered into confidentiality agreements with the alternative purchaser in late January, 2001, with Polycom on March 7, 2001, and with one other entity, which did not
pursue a transaction, in early March so that each could conduct business and legal due diligence.
The confidentiality agreements with each of Polycom and the alternative purchaser provided for the
confidentiality of information provided by PictureTel, as well as an agreement that neither party thereto would acquire, or make an offer to acquire, assets or property of the other or merge with the
other without the prior consent of PictureTel's board of directors for a period of time specified in the respective agreements. 

    
In
late March 2001, Mr. DeVigne and Mr. Jaffe spoke by telephone to arrange a meeting to discuss Polycom's interest in purchasing PictureTel's videoconferencing
products division.
On April 5, 2001,
Messrs. Hagerty, Kourey, DeVigne and William Paape, Polycom's Vice President, Finance and Strategic Investments, and representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, Polycom's financial advisor,
met in Chicago with Mr. Jaffe, Robert Kelligrew, PictureTel's General Counsel, and Dalton Edgecomb, PictureTel's Chief Financial Officer, and representatives of Robertson Stephens, PictureTel's
financial advisor, to discuss an acquisition by Polycom of PictureTel's videoconferencing products division.
During the week following that meeting, Mr. Hagerty had several telephone calls with
representatives of Robertson Stephens to discuss Polycom's proposed acquisition of PictureTel's videoconferencing products division and PictureTel's interest in a potential business combination
involving the entire company.
In accordance with PictureTel's instructions, representatives of Robertson Stephens informed Polycom that PictureTel had determined that selling the videoconferencing
products division while retaining the services division was not an appropriate strategic initiative for PictureTel.
Following these discussions, on April 11, 2001, Polycom provided PictureTel
with a proposal on the material terms of a potential business combination involving the entire company. 

    
During
March and early April of 2001, the alternative purchaser also evaluated a potential business combination with PictureTel and provided its proposal on the material terms of such
a transaction to PictureTel. 

    
On April 13, 2001, PictureTel's board of directors convened to discuss the proposals received from the alternative purchaser and Polycom.
Robertson Stephens reviewed and
summarized for the PictureTel board the financial details of each proposal and answered various questions from the PictureTel board about each proposal.
Extensive discussions by the PictureTel board
members then followed regarding the strengths and weaknesses of both proposals.
Following these discussions, PictureTel's board of directors determined to pursue negotiations with the alternative
purchaser and authorized PictureTel's management to sign on behalf of PictureTel a term sheet containing an exclusivity provision, which term sheet was non-binding except with respect to
certain limited exclusivity matters, with the alternative purchaser.
After this PictureTel board meeting, on April 13, 2001, PictureTel signed the term sheet with the alternative purchaser.

Among other provisions, the term sheet provided that PictureTel and its representatives could not solicit or negotiate a business combination with any other entities, except in response to an
unsolicited proposal, to the extent PictureTel was required to do so by applicable fiduciary duties, after consultation with outside counsel, and required PictureTel to notify the alternative
purchaser in such event.
After signing this term sheet, in accordance with PictureTel's instructions, a representative of Robertson Stephens telephoned Mr. Hagerty to notify him that PictureTel
had entered into an exclusivity arrangement with another party and that PictureTel was required to discontinue its discussions with Polycom. 

    
On
April 24, 2001, PictureTel received a first draft of a proposed merger agreement from the alternative purchaser's counsel.
Between April 24, 2001 and May 18,
2001, PictureTel and its legal and financial advisors negotiated the terms of this proposed merger agreement with the alternative purchaser and its financial and legal advisors.
These discussions
included negotiation over the form of the consideration to be offered, increases in the per share consideration, and alternative structures for a transaction. 

    
On
May 10, 2001, PictureTel and its legal and financial advisors met with the alternative purchaser and its counsel to discuss the outstanding issues on the draft alternative
purchaser's merger agreement and the then pending revised terms and structure of a proposed transaction.
During these discussions, the alternative purchaser stated that it had not yet obtained
financing for its proposed transaction, but that it expected to receive a commitment letter from a financial institution by May 14, 2001.
The parties discussed changing the structure of the
transaction from a merger to a cash tender offer, and different forms of consideration that might be necessary if the alternative purchaser were unable to finance the cash purchase price. 

    
On
May 9 and 10, 2001, Polycom's management discussed with Thomas Weisel Partners, and on May 10, 2001 Polycom's management also discussed with Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, WSGR, legal counsel to Polycom, Polycom's continued interest in entering into a business combination transaction with PictureTel.
Polycom noted that
several weeks had elapsed since PictureTel had discontinued its discussions with Polycom and that PictureTel had not yet announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with a third party
regarding a business combination transaction.
After discussion with its financial and legal advisors, Polycom prepared a letter to send to PictureTel advising it of Polycom's continued interest in a
potential business combination transaction with PictureTel. 

    
Late
in the afternoon on May 11, 2001, Mr. Hagerty called Mr. Gaut but was unable to reach him.
He then called Mr. Jaffe to notify him that Polycom would
be sending a letter to PictureTel indicating that it was interested in an acquisition of PictureTel.
The price proposed by Polycom was materially higher than the price proposed by the alternative
purchaser.
Mr. Jaffe indicated to Mr. Hagerty that he could not discuss any transaction with him, hung up the phone, and then immediately called a representative of the alternative
purchaser to inform him of the call.
At approximately the same time, a representative of Robertson Stephens received a call from a representative of Thomas Weisel Partners notifying him of the letter
that Polycom intended to send to PictureTel.
Later that afternoon, PictureTel 

received a letter addressed to Mr. Gaut from Polycom indicating its interest in purchasing all of PictureTel's outstanding shares for cash, Polycom common stock or a combination thereof. 

    
On
Sunday, May 13, 2001, an informal conference call of PictureTel's board of directors was convened during which Mr. Jaffe updated the members of PictureTel's board of
directors on the call on the status of negotiations with the alternative purchaser and on the call and letter from Polycom.
Mr. Jaffe then called a representative of the alternative purchaser
to discuss further the alternative purchaser's proposed transaction in light of the terms described in the letter from Polycom. 

    
PictureTel's
board of directors subsequently met in the morning on May 14, 2001 to discuss the status of the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser and instructed
management to continue negotiations with the alternative purchaser.
The PictureTel board also discussed further the Polycom
letter received on May 11, 2001.
The PictureTel board noted that Polycom's proposal provided for a higher price per share than the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser and that
Polycom's offer provided PictureTel with debt financing which could potentially be greater than the debt financing included in the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser.
After discussing
the matter with outside counsel, the PictureTel board concluded that its applicable fiduciary duties required it to negotiate with Polycom in response to Polycom's unsolicited proposal and instructed
Robertson Stephens to contact Polycom regarding its proposal. 

    
Late
in the afternoon on May 14, 2001, PictureTel, the alternative purchaser and their respective legal counsel again met to discuss outstanding issues on the draft merger
agreement and related documents.
During the course of the discussions, the alternative purchaser informed PictureTel that it still did not have a firm commitment letter for financing the transaction.

PictureTel and the alternative purchaser continued to negotiate and new deal terms were proposed by the parties, including changes in the amount and form of the consideration and the structure of the
transaction.
In addition, the parties negotiated certain changes to the debt financing proposed by the alternative purchaser, including a potential increase in the amount of debt financing that would
be available to PictureTel and a reduction of the limitations applicable to the use of such funds by PictureTel.
The parties continued to meet throughout the day on May 15, 2001 in order to
discuss the remaining outstanding issues.
PictureTel's board of directors participated via conference call in two special PictureTel board meetings to discuss the terms of the new proposal under
consideration.
At the second meeting, the PictureTel board voted: (1) to authorize PictureTel to enter into an escrow agreement with the alternative purchaser, which provided, among other
terms, for funds to be deposited and later made available to PictureTel if PictureTel and the alternative purchaser did not enter into a definitive agreement due to the alternative purchaser's failure
to act in good faith or if the alternative purchaser did not obtain a financing commitment reasonably satisfactory to PictureTel, or returned to the alternative purchaser if PictureTel signed a term
sheet or other definitive agreement with another entity and (2) to extend the exclusivity provision, subject to the PictureTel board's fiduciary duties, of the April 13 term sheet until
May 21, 2001 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time. 

    
On
Tuesday, May 15, 2001 Polycom again expressed its interest in acquiring PictureTel and indicated that it planned to provide a more detailed term sheet outlining the terms of
a proposed transaction later that day.
The term sheet provided by Polycom reflected a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares at a higher price per share than the proposed transaction with the
alternative purchaser and also included a proposal for a debt financing that would be made available to PictureTel. 

    
On
the morning of Wednesday, May 16, 2001, Mr. Jaffe met with PictureTel's legal and financial advisors to discuss Polycom's revised proposal.
PictureTel's legal
counsel, Ropes & Gray, met with the alternative purchaser's legal counsel to continue to negotiate the terms of that transaction prior to PictureTel's board of directors meeting at
12:00 p.m.
The PictureTel board of directors met at noon to discuss the revised Polycom proposal.
At the PictureTel board meeting, the PictureTel board determined, after consultation with
Ropes & Gray, that, as a result of (1) Polycom's higher all-cash 

offer, (2) the more favorable terms of the proposed convertible debt financing by Polycom and (3) continued concerns about the alternative purchaser's ability to finance its proposed
transaction, the PictureTel board's fiduciary duties to PictureTel's stockholders required the PictureTel board to evaluate and negotiate a possible transaction with Polycom while continuing to pursue
a transaction with the alternative purchaser.
Immediately after the PictureTel board meeting on May 16, 2001, Robertson Stephens, at the direction of PictureTel, and Mr. Jaffe called the
alternative purchaser's legal counsel to inform them that PictureTel had received a proposal with a higher offer from another bidder.
Mr. Jaffe also informed them that PictureTel wished to
continue negotiating a definitive agreement with the alternative purchaser. 

    
Later
on Wednesday, May 16, 2001, Mr. Jaffe, together with PictureTel's legal and financial advisors, met with Polycom and its advisors regarding its acquisition
proposal.
The parties continued to negotiate the term sheets relating to Polycom's proposed acquisition and debt financing. 

    
On
Thursday, May 17, 2001, the Polycom board of directors met to review the terms of the proposed transaction.
Messrs. Hagerty and Kourey reviewed the strategic
rationale for the proposed transaction.
Representatives of WSGR and Thomas Weisel Partners also participated in the meeting and responded to questions by the Polycom board of directors.
Also on
Thursday, May 17, 2001, Polycom and its legal, financial and accounting advisors commenced their due diligence investigation of PictureTel.
This due diligence investigation continued through
the signing of the definitive merger agreement on May 24, 2001. 

    
On
Thursday, May 17, 2001, Mr. Jaffe and PictureTel's financial advisor met throughout the day with Polycom and its financial advisor to discuss the terms of the
proposed acquisition and debt financing pending the proposed transaction.
PictureTel and Ropes & Gray also attempted to finalize negotiations on a definitive merger agreement with the
alternative purchaser.
PictureTel held informal conference calls with various members of its board of directors throughout the day to keep them apprised of the status of discussions with Polycom and
the alternative purchaser.
Polycom and PictureTel and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the term sheets relating to Polycom's proposed acquisition and debt
financing. 

    
On
the morning of Friday, May 18, 2001, the alternative purchaser notified Mr. Gaut and the alternative purchaser's legal counsel notified Ropes & Gray that the
alternative purchaser was discontinuing its discussions with PictureTel regarding the proposed business combination transaction.
The board of directors of PictureTel met to discuss the status of
negotiations with the alternative purchaser, as well as its ongoing negotiations with Polycom.
The PictureTel board raised various concerns regarding the need for sufficient liquidity for PictureTel
and discussed the terms of Polycom's acquisition proposal and debt financing generally.
At this meeting, the PictureTel board of directors authorized PictureTel to execute an exclusivity agreement
with Polycom pursuant to which PictureTel would agree not to negotiate with other parties until after midnight on Friday, May 25, 2001.
The PictureTel board agreed to reconvene on Sunday
morning, May 19, 2001, to discuss the proposed transaction further.
Mr. Jaffe, with the assistance of PictureTel's legal and financial advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of the
proposed transaction with Polycom and its legal and financial advisors throughout the day.
During the day, and in exchange for certain changes to other terms of the transaction, Polycom agreed to
increase the proposed purchase price, provided that it could pay the purchase price with a combination of cash and Polycom stock. 

    
Throughout
the day on Saturday, May 19 and Sunday, May 20, 2001, PictureTel, Polycom and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to meet in person and/or
by telephone to discuss changes to the proposed terms of the acquisition and the debt financing.
In particular, the parties also discussed appropriate mechanisms to retain key employees and the
conditions on which the debt financing would be available to PictureTel and the terms of its conversion into PictureTel common stock or repayment.
On the morning of Sunday, May 20, PictureTel's
board of directors convened an informal 

conference call to discuss the status of the negotiations with Polycom, including proposed changes to the amount and form of the consideration to be paid in the transaction. 

    
Between
Monday, May 21 and Thursday, May 24, 2001, Polycom, PictureTel and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the definitive
documentation relating to the acquisition and debt financing.
Among other matters, the parties discussed various liabilities that Polycom or its acquisition subsidiary would be assuming in connection
with its acquisition of PictureTel, such as existing severance obligations, and negotiated the effect of those assumed liabilities on the purchase price.
These discussions eventually resulted in a
negotiated price per share of $3.11 in cash for the cash portion and a stock exchange ratio of 0.1177 of a share of Polycom common stock for the stock portion.
Also during this period, Polycom and
PictureTel continued their business and legal due diligence investigations of each other. 

    
On
Monday, May 21, 2001, members of PictureTel's board of directors convened again by informal conference call to discuss the alternative purchaser's discontinuation of its
discussions with PictureTel and to discuss the status of the negotiations with Polycom. 

    
Based
on having concluded their negotiation of the term sheets relating to the proposed acquisition and debt financing, Polycom and PictureTel executed an exclusivity agreement on
Tuesday, May 22, 2001, pursuant to which PictureTel agreed not to negotiate with other parties until after midnight on Friday, May 25, 2001. 

    
On
Wednesday, May 23, 2001, Mr. Jaffe and PictureTel's financial advisor met in California with Polycom and its financial advisor to finalize their negotiation.
Members
of PictureTel's board of directors convened informally by conference call on May 22 and formally on May 23 with Mr. Jaffe, other members of PictureTel's management, Robertson
Stephens and Ropes & Gray to discuss the status of negotiations with Polycom, the proposed merger agreement and related agreements, certain financial analyses and other related matters. 

    
On
Thursday, May 24, 2001, PictureTel's board of directors met again to review the matters previously considered, including the financial and other terms of the offer, the
availability and amount of debt financing under the merger agreement, the historical market prices, recent trading activity and trading range of PictureTel's Common Stock, including the premium in the
offer as of the announcement date, the risks in consummating the transaction, the history of the net losses of PictureTel since 1997, PictureTel's recent need for restructurings and the financial
condition, results of operation and cash flows of PictureTel, the results of earlier discussions with other companies and results of the process undertaken by Robertson Stephens at the direction of
PictureTel on behalf of PictureTel to solicit third party indications of interest, the extensive arms-length negotiations with Polycom that resulted in the final offer price, the financial
strength of Polycom, Polycom's agreement to make public statements relating to PictureTel's iPower PC architecture, the fact that PictureTel's stockholders will have a right to continue, through
ownership of stock of Polycom, at least indirectly, in the growth of PictureTel's business, the risk factors associated with the business of Polycom, the current status of the industries and markets
in which PictureTel competes and the expected increased level of competition, the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the provisions for a "fiduciary out" in the merger agreement
and the determination of the termination fee and the terms and conditions of the related transaction documentation, at the recent PictureTel board meetings and on informal conference calls and to act
on the proposed transaction.
At such meeting, Mr. Jaffe and PictureTel's legal counsel presented the terms of the proposed transaction with Polycom.
Also at such meeting, Robertson Stephens
reviewed with the PictureTel board its financial analysis of the aggregate consideration offered and rendered to the PictureTel board its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and
as of that date, of the aggregate consideration to be received in the transaction by the holders of PictureTel Common Stock.
Following discussion, the PictureTel board unanimously determined that the
offer, merger and merger agreement are advisable, fair and in the 

best interest of PictureTel's shareholders and approved the terms of the merger agreement and authorized the execution of the merger agreement and related transaction documentation. 

    
On
May 24, 2001, the Polycom board of directors met to discuss the proposed transaction terms and the results of Polycom's due diligence investigation.
Representatives of WSGR,
Thomas Weisel Partners and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., who also acted as Polycom's financial advisors in this transaction, also participated.
The Polycom board of directors unanimously
approved the terms of the merger agreement and authorized the execution of the merger agreement and related transaction documentation. 

    
Following
further discussions among representatives of PictureTel and Polycom to complete the definitive agreements, the parties executed the merger agreement in the early evening on
Thursday, May 24, 2001.
Promptly thereafter, Polycom and PictureTel issued a joint press release announcing the transaction which is included as Exhibit (a)(7) to the Schedule TO
filed by Polycom on June 18, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference. 

    
From
May 24, 2001 through June 14, 2001, PictureTel, Polycom and their respective legal advisors continue to negotiate and finalize the terms of the convertible note
financing with PictureTel's senior
lender and its counsel.
On June 15, 2001, PictureTel and Polycom executed a note agreement and related documents and issued convertible notes to Polycom. 

    
On
June 18, 2001 in accordance with the merger agreement, Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. commenced the offer. 

REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND THE MERGER    

 Expand Our Product Offerings  

•
The
PC-based video conferencing systems sold by PictureTel are targeted for collaboration-intensive applications, with demand forecasted to
grow robustly over the next several years.
Polycom supplies systems that are appliance-based, which many customers view as more suitable for their particular needs.


•
We
believe the combination of Polycom and PictureTel will extend our customer reach in the communications industry by augmenting our leading
appliance-based architecture with PictureTel's PC-based architecture, thereby increasing the choices available to customers. 

 
Expand Our Service Offerings  

•
PictureTel
has well-established and comprehensive service offerings and capabilities that support its product offerings.
Polycom's service offerings and
capabilities are much more limited.
Accordingly, we believe the combination of Polycom and PictureTel will allow new and existing customers of Polycom products to avail themselves of these
comprehensive service offerings and capabilities that previously were unavailable to them. 

 
Expand the Communications Equipment Market  

•
We
believe that as a result of this acquisition, the combined company will be in a better position to expand the communications equipment market overall.

The financial resources, technical expertise, intellectual property and technologies, and marketing capabilities of the combined company will give it a better opportunity to serve customers and expand
the market through new, improved, and lower priced products, new and expanded services, targeted marketing, and communication and collaboration with customers around the world than otherwise possible
as separate companies. 

 
Leverage Intellectual Property Across Product Lines  

•
We
believe that as a result of this acquisition, Polycom will be positioned to further leverage our robust video communications technology with
PictureTel's collaboration-intensive PC-based technology.


•
We
believe the combination of Polycom and PictureTel will allow for the combined intellectual property, including audio and video technologies, to be
leveraged across the combined company's entire portfolio of products thereby further enhancing the capabilities, price performance, features, and functions of existing products and those in
development at both companies. 

 
Broaden Our Opportunity for Revenue Growth  

•
We
believe that the incorporation of PictureTel into our video communications product area will provide us with a more complete product offering that will
broaden Polycom's opportunity for revenue growth, not only in our video product area but also in our network systems area, which benefits from the deployment of group and desktop video devices.


•
After
the closing of the acquisition, Polycom will benefit from PictureTel's leading PC-based iPower video collaboration technology, their
broad customer base, and their excellent development and sales staff throughout the world.


•
We
believe the acquisition will allow the combined company to leverage PictureTel's comprehensive service offerings across all of Polycom's voice, video,
network access, and network systems communications products which will provide new opportunities for generating service revenue that would not otherwise exist. 

 
Improve Competitive Position  

•
We
believe the combination of Polycom and PictureTel will better equip the combined company with the financial, technological, operational, and marketing
resources and capabilities that will be necessary to successfully compete in the highly competitive communications equipment market that increasingly includes companies with far greater resources and
capabilities such as Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Sony Corporation, Sun Microsystems and webcam and infrastructure providers including companies such as Dell, Intel and Compaq. 

 
Gain Cost Benefits  

•
Following
the closing of the acquisition, we plan to transition PictureTel's manufacturing to our model, gaining the cost benefits associated with our
lower-cost, high-volume contract manufacturing process.
This is expected to improve gross margins from PictureTel's margins today.


•
Also,
we plan to utilize the significant operating synergies between our organizations in the sales, marketing, finance, and administrative areas as we
rationalize the combined entity worldwide. 


Recommendation of PictureTel's Board of Directors  

    At a meeting held on May 24, 2001, the Board of Directors of PictureTel unanimously: 

•
determined
that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger taken together, are at a price and on
terms that are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; 

•
approved
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, in all respects; and

•
determined
to recommend that PictureTel's stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant thereto and approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

    
In
approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, and recommending that all holders of PictureTel common stock accept
the offer and tender their shares of common stock pursuant to the offer, and approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the board of directors of PictureTel considered a number of factors
including, but not limited to, the following: 

•
The
historical market prices, recent trading activity and trading range of PictureTel's common stock, including the fact that the consideration to be paid
in the offer (valued as of the day before announcement of the transaction) represents (i) a premium of approximately 44.3% over the $4.45 closing price of PictureTel's common stock on Nasdaq on
May 23, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the date of announcement of the offer and the merger and (ii) a premium of approximately 267% over the $1.75 trading price of
PictureTel's common stock on Nasdaq on April 4, 2001, the date in the last 12 months on which the shares of PictureTel's common stock had their lowest trading price.


•
The
history of net losses of PictureTel since 1997, PictureTel's recent need for restructurings, and the financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows of PictureTel generally, including PictureTel's prospects as an independent company and the risks inherent in remaining independent, including competitive risks of increased levels of
competition in the videoconferencing industry and the risks of operating in a loss position with negative cash flow in a market in which it is currently difficult to raise debt and equity capital.


•
The
results of the earlier discussions with Polycom and/or others regarding a possible strategic alliance, business combination, acquisition or similar
transaction with the Company and the results of the exploration by PictureTel of possible strategic alliance or stand alone opportunities for PictureTel as an ongoing independent, publicly held
corporation, including its discussions with Polycom regarding the possible sale of PictureTel's videoconferencing products, but not services business, and with several entities regarding the possible
sale of its video conferencing hosting business.


•
The
process undertaken by Robertson Stephens at the direction and on behalf of PictureTel to solicit third party indications of interest in the acquisition
of all or a part of PictureTel in late 2000 and early 2001 and the fact that only two bidders submitted written acquisition proposals in connection with that process; the fact that PictureTel had
actively negotiated a business combination with one of these bidders which later terminated its negotiations with PictureTel (and had never satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to finance its
offer) and that neither that bidder, nor any other party, presented PictureTel with an acquisition proposal that, taken as a whole, would be more favorable to PictureTel and its stockholders than the
offer and the merger.


•
The
extensive arms-length negotiations between PictureTel and Polycom that resulted in the final offer price per share.


•
The
financial presentation of Robertson Stephens, including its opinion dated May 24, 2001 to the board of directors of PictureTel as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the aggregate consideration to be received in the transaction by the holders of PictureTel common stock, as more fully
described below under the caption "Opinion 

of
PictureTel's Financial Advisor" in PictureTel's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being furnished to you together with this prospectus. 


•
Polycom's
agreement to make public statements, which would be communicated to its sales force, stating that its belief in PictureTel's iPower PC
architecture was a significant factor in its decision to enter into the merger agreement with PictureTel and after the consummation of the offer and the merger, that Polycom intends to sell and
support PictureTel's iPower PC based products, and to develop next generation appliance and PC products using the best features of the Viewstation and iPower PC platforms, Polycom's agreement to state
in all press releases relating to the merger agreement or the exchange offer its belief that appliance and PC based architectures are needed to exploit pent up demand, and Polycom's agreement that it
would not issue press releases or make other public statements, or give instructions to its sales force, in contravention of these obligations.


•
The
fact that because only a portion of the consideration to be paid by Polycom in the offer and the merger is common stock, and because this common stock
is of Polycom and not of PictureTel, that PictureTel's stockholders will no longer be entitled to share directly and entirely in the growth and performance of PictureTel, but PictureTel stockholders
will nonetheless have the right to continue to share indirectly in the future growth and performance of PictureTel's business after the closing of the offer and the merger as a part of Polycom.


•
Because
a portion of the consideration to be paid by Polycom in the offer and the merger is Polycom common stock, PictureTel stockholders will be subject
to the risks associated with being a stockholder of Polycom, as detailed in the prospectus under the section headed "Risk Factors.
"

•
Polycom's
willingness to provide PictureTel with debt financing, as further described in the prospectus under the heading "Agreements Related to the Merger
Agreement—Note Agreement," which would, in the view of PictureTel, provide it with sufficient liquidity pending the closing of the offer and the merger or, should the closing of the offer
not occur, to enable PictureTel to continue to operate as an independent company, including to be in a position to raise additional financing as may be appropriate at that time.


•
The
current status of the industries in which PictureTel competes and the resources available to PictureTel's competitors, many of which are significantly
larger than PictureTel.


•
The
fact that Polycom's and Pharaoh Acquisition Corp.'s obligations under the offer are not subject to any financing condition, and the financial strength
of Polycom.


•
The
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to their respective
obligations and the limited ability of Polycom and Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. to terminate the offer or the merger agreement.


•
Polycom's
agreement that as a means of retention, PictureTel would grant options effective immediately prior to the closing of the offer to purchase up to
5,500,000 shares of PictureTel common stock to PictureTel employees in amounts agreed to by Polycom, which Polycom would assume in the merger.


•
The
merger agreement provides that Polycom will cause PictureTel to honor PictureTel's obligations to indemnify PictureTel's directors and officers (except
that the obligations of Polycom shall not extend to claims against PictureTel's officers and directors in connection with the SEC's investigation of the restatement of the financial reports of
PictureTel in certain periods in 1997 and 1998), and will provide directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of three years following the closing of the merger, subject to certain
limitations.


•
The
merger agreement permits the PictureTel board, in order to comply with its fiduciary duties, to furnish information and enter into discussions and
negotiations, in connection with an 

unsolicited
acquisition proposal that the PictureTel board reasonably concludes in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a superior
proposal and to withdraw its recommendation of the offer and the merger in favor of an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal, subject to certain limitations. 


•
The
merger agreement requires PictureTel to keep Polycom informed of any acquisition proposal it receives, and give Polycom the opportunity to increase the
offer price prior to terminating the merger agreement in connection with an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal.


•
The
merger agreement permits the PictureTel board, if required by its fiduciary duties to do so, to terminate the merger agreement in favor of an
unsolicited superior acquisition proposal, subject to certain limitations, provided, that prior to and as a condition to such termination, PictureTel must pay Polycom a termination fee of
$14.5 million, which represents 4% of the value of the consideration payable to stockholders of PictureTel in the offer and the merger. 

    
The
foregoing discussion of information and factors considered and given weight by the board of directors of PictureTel is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include
all of the material factors, both positive and negative, considered by the PictureTel board of directors.
In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the offer
and the merger, the PictureTel board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determinations and recommendations.
In addition, individual members of the PictureTel board of directors may have given different weights to different factors.

stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of
the change, and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any public announcement other

If
we make a material change in the terms of our offer or the information concerning the offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will extend the offer to the
extent required under the Exchange Act.

If we elect
to provide a subsequent offering period, we will make a public announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time on the next business day after the previously scheduled
expiration date. 


Exchange of PictureTel Shares; Delivery of Consideration  

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer including, if the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of the extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, PictureTel shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn promptly after the expiration date and promptly after they are tendered during
any subsequent offering period.
In addition, subject to applicable rules of the SEC, we expressly reserve the right to delay acceptance for exchange or the exchange of PictureTel shares in order to
obtain any governmental regulatory approvals.
In all cases, exchange of PictureTel shares tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
exchange agent of certificates for those PictureTel shares or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer of those PictureTel shares in the exchange agent's account at The Depository Trust
Company, which we refer to as DTC, a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a manually signed facsimile of that document and any other required documents. 

    
For
purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange PictureTel shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and when we notify the exchange agent
of our acceptance of the tenders of those PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer.
The exchange agent will deliver Polycom common stock and cash, including cash instead of any fractional shares of
Polycom common stock, in exchange for PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer promptly after receipt of our notice.
The exchange agent will act as agent for Polycom for the purpose of receiving
Polycom common stock and cash to be paid, including cash instead of any fractional shares of Polycom common stock, and transmitting the stock and cash to you.
You will not receive any interest on any
cash that we pay you, even if there is a delay in making the exchange. 

    
If
we do not accept any tendered PictureTel shares for exchange pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for more PictureTel
shares than are accepted, we will return certificates for the unexchanged PictureTel shares to the tendering stockholder or, in the case of PictureTel shares tendered by book-entry
transfer of unexchanged PictureTel shares into the exchange agent's account at DTC pursuant to the procedures set forth below under the discussion entitled "Procedure for Tendering" on page 51 and
those PictureTel shares will be credited to an account maintained within DTC as soon as practicable following expiration or termination of the offer. 


Cash Instead of Fractional Shares of Polycom Common Stock  

    We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of our common stock pursuant to the offer.
Instead, each tendering stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of our common stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Polycom common stock that would otherwise be received by the holder) will receive cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, in an 

amount equal to that fraction multiplied by the closing price of Polycom common stock, as reported on Nasdaq, on the first date on which we accept shares for exchange in the offer. 


Withdrawal Rights  

    Your tender of PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer is irrevocable, except that, other than during a subsequent offering period, PictureTel shares tendered
pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date, and, unless we previously accepted them for exchange pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after
August 16, 2001.
If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period under Exchange Act Rule 14d-11, you will not have the right to withdraw PictureTel shares that you tender
in the subsequent offering period. 

    
For
your withdrawal to be effective, the exchange agent must receive from you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one of its addresses set forth on the
back cover of this prospectus, and your notice must include your name, address, social security number, the certificate number(s) and the number of PictureTel shares to be withdrawn as well as the
name of the registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who tendered those PictureTel shares. 

    
A
financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of withdrawal unless those PictureTel shares have been tendered for the account of any eligible institution.
Most
banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses are able to provide these signature guarantees for you.
The financial institution must be a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program, an eligible institution.
If PictureTel shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry tender discussed under the caption below entitled
"—Procedure for Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn PictureTel shares and must otherwise comply
with DTC's procedures.
If certificates have been delivered or otherwise identified to the exchange agent, the name of the registered holder and the serial numbers of the particular certificates
evidencing the PictureTel shares withdrawn must also be furnished to the exchange agent, as stated above, prior to the physical release of the certificates.
We will decide all questions as to the form
and validity, including time of receipt, of any notice of withdrawal, in our sole discretion, and our decision shall be final and binding. 

    
Neither
we, the exchange agent, the information agent nor any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or
will incur any liability for failure to give any notification.
Any PictureTel shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of our offer.
However, you may
retender withdrawn PictureTel shares by following one of the procedures discussed below under the captions entitled "Procedure for Tendering" or "Guaranteed Delivery" on pages 51 and 52 at any time
prior to the expiration date. 


Procedure for Tendering  

    For you to validly tender PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer: 

•
the
enclosed letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, or manually executed facsimile of that document, along with any required
signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must be transmitted to and received by the exchange agent at the
address set forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and certificates for tendered PictureTel shares must be received by the exchange agent at that address or those PictureTel shares must be
tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry tender set forth below, and a confirmation of receipt of the tender received, which confirmation we refer to below as a
book-entry confirmation, in each case before the expiration date; or

•
you
must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below. 

    
The
term agent's message means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation, which states that DTC
has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in DTC tendering the PictureTel shares which are the subject of the book-entry confirmation, that the participant has received
and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce that agreement against the participant. 

    
The
exchange agent will establish accounts with respect to the PictureTel shares at DTC for purposes of the offer within two business days after the date of this prospectus, and any
financial institution that is a participant in DTC may make book-entry delivery of the PictureTel shares by causing DTC to transfer tendered PictureTel shares into the exchange agent's
account in accordance with DTC's procedure for the transfer.
However, although delivery of PictureTel shares may be effected through book-entry at DTC, the letter of transmittal, or a
manually signed facsimile thereof, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must, in any
case, be transmitted to and received by the exchange agent at the address set forth on the back cover of this prospectus prior to the expiration date, or the guaranteed delivery procedures described
below must be followed. 

    
Signatures
on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution, except in cases in which PictureTel shares are tendered either by a registered holder of
PictureTel shares who has not completed the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or "Special Delivery Instructions" on the letter of transmittal or for the account of an eligible institution. 

    
If
the certificates for PictureTel shares are registered in the name of a person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or if certificates for unexchanged
PictureTel shares are to be issued to a person other than the registered holder(s), the certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the
name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates, with the signature(s) on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed in the manner we have described above. 


The method of delivery of PictureTel share certificates and all other required documents, including delivery through DTC, is at your option and risk, and the
delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the exchange agent.
If delivery is by mail, we recommend registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured.
In all cases, you
should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery.  

 
Guaranteed Delivery  

    
If you wish to tender PictureTel shares pursuant to our offer and your certificates are not immediately available or you cannot deliver the certificates and
all other required documents to the exchange agent prior to the expiration date or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry transfer on a timely basis, your PictureTel shares may
nevertheless be tendered, so long as all of the following conditions are satisfied: 

•
You
make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

•
The
enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery, properly completed and duly executed, substantially in the form enclosed with this prospectus, is received by
the exchange agent as provided below on or prior to the expiration date; and

•
The
certificates for all tendered PictureTel shares, or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer of tendered securities into the exchange
agent's account at DTC as described above, in proper form for transfer, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a manually signed facsimile thereof, with any
required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message, and all other documents required by the letter of transmittal are received by the exchange
agent within three Nasdaq trading days after the date 

of
execution of the notice of guaranteed delivery.
You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by facsimile transmission or mail to the exchange agent and you must include
a signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form set forth in that notice. 

    
In
all cases, we will exchange PictureTel shares tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to our offer only after timely receipt by the exchange agent of certificates for
PictureTel shares, or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of tendered securities into the exchange agent's account at DTC as described above, properly completed and duly executed
letter(s) of transmittal, or manually signed facsimile(s) thereof, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents. 

    
By
executing a letter of transmittal as set forth above, you irrevocably appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full power of
substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your PictureTel shares tendered and accepted for exchange by us and with respect to any and all other PictureTel shares and other
securities, other than the shares of PictureTel common stock, issued or issuable in respect of the PictureTel shares on or after July 17, 2001.
That appointment is
effective if and when, and only to the extent that, we accept the shares of PictureTel common stock for exchange pursuant to the offer.
All of these proxies shall be considered coupled with an
interest in the tendered PictureTel shares and therefore shall not be revocable.
Upon the effectiveness of the appointment, all prior proxies that you have given will be revoked, and you may not give
any subsequent proxies, and, if given, they will not be deemed effective.
Our designees will, with respect to the PictureTel shares for which the appointment is effective, be empowered, among other
things, to exercise all of your voting and other rights as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of PictureTel's stockholders or otherwise.
We reserve
the right to require that, in order for PictureTel shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon our exchange of those PictureTel shares, we must be able to exercise full voting rights with
respect to the tendered PictureTel shares. 

    
We
will determine questions as to the validity, form, eligibility including time of receipt, and acceptance for exchange of any tender of PictureTel shares, in our sole discretion,
and our determination shall be final and binding.
We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of PictureTel shares that we determine are not in proper form or the acceptance of or
exchange for which may, in the opinion of our counsel, be unlawful.
We also reserve the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the tender of any PictureTel shares.
No tender of those
PictureTel shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities in tenders of those PictureTel shares have been cured or waived.
Neither we, the exchange agent, the
information agent nor any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the tender of any PictureTel shares or will incur any liability for failure to
give notification.
Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of our offer, including the letter of transmittal and instructions thereto, will be final and binding. 

    
The
tender of PictureTel shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between us and you upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the offer. 


Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger  

    
The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal income tax consequences to holders of PictureTel common stock who sell shares in the
offer or the merger.
This discussion is based on current federal income tax law, which is subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect) in a manner that could affect the information
set forth below. 

    
This discussion is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential tax effects of the offer or the merger for all categories of
PictureTel stockholders.
In particular, this discussion does not deal with all United States federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to PictureTel stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances (such as stockholders who are insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities, stockholders who hold their shares of PictureTel common stock
as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, or conversion transaction, who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, who are foreign
persons, who do not hold their shares as capital assets, or who acquired their shares upon exercise of stock options or in other compensatory transactions).
In addition, the following discussion does
not address the tax consequences of the offer or the merger under foreign, state, or local tax laws. 

    
The
receipt of cash and shares of Polycom common stock in exchange for shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the offer or the merger will be a taxable transaction for federal
income tax purposes.
Each PictureTel stockholder's gain or loss per share of PictureTel common stock will be equal to the difference between the fair market value of the consideration received in the
offer and/or the merger and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in such shares.
Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of PictureTel shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost
in a single transaction) exchanged pursuant to the offer or the merger.
Assuming that such shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the PictureTel stockholder, such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder's holding period is more than one year.
Capital losses are only deductible to the extent of capital gains
plus, in the case of taxpayers other than corporations, $3,000 of ordinary income.
Capital losses that are not currently deductible may be carried forward to other years, subject to certain
limitations. 

    
PictureTel
stockholders who do not sell their shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the offer or the merger and who exercise and perfect their appraisal rights under Delaware
law to demand fair value for such shares will recognize gain or loss (and may recognize an amount of interest income) attributable to any payment received pursuant to the exercise of such rights.

Assuming that such shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the PictureTel stockholder, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the stockholder's holding period is more than one year. 

    
Backup Withholding.
  
Stockholders may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of 31 percent with respect to
payments of cash consideration in the offer or the merger or as the result of the exercise of appraisal rights unless the stockholder provides a correct taxpayer identification number in the manner
required or certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding or is an "exempt recipient."
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, but rather may be credited against the taxpayer's tax
liability for the year. 


The foregoing summary of federal income tax consequences is included herein for general information only.
Accordingly, stockholders are urged to consult their
own tax advisors regarding the federal, state, local, foreign, and other tax consequences of the offer and the merger in light of their particular circumstances.


Purpose of the Offer; the Merger; Appraisal Rights  

 Purpose  

    We are making the offer in order to acquire control of at least a majority of the common stock of PictureTel on a fully diluted basis.
The offer is the first
step in our acquisition of PictureTel and is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock.
We intend, as soon as practicable after completion of
the offer, to have Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. merge with and into PictureTel.
The purpose of the merger is to acquire all PictureTel shares not tendered 

and exchanged pursuant to the offer.
In the merger, each then outstanding PictureTel share, except for PictureTel shares held in PictureTel's treasury, PictureTel shares owned by Polycom or Pharaoh
Acquisition Corp. and, if applicable, PictureTel shares held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights, would be converted into the right to receive the same amount of cash and number of Polycom
shares as is paid in the offer, subject to appraisal rights that may be exercised under the Delaware General Corporation Law, also referred to as the DGCL. 

 
Approval of the Merger  

    Under Section 251 of the DGCL, the approval of the board of directors of a company and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of its
outstanding shares are required to approve and adopt a merger and a merger agreement.
The PictureTel board of directors has previously approved the merger.
Accordingly, if we complete the offer, we
would have a sufficient number of PictureTel shares to approve the merger without the affirmative vote of any other holder of PictureTel shares.
Therefore, unless the merger is consummated in
accordance with the short form merger provisions under the DGCL described below, in which case no action by the stockholders of PictureTel, other than by Polycom acting in its capacity as the majority
shareholder, will be required to consummate the merger,
the only remaining corporate action of PictureTel will be the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding PictureTel shares. 

 
Possible Short Form Merger  

    Section 253 of the DGCL would permit the merger to occur without a vote of PictureTel's stockholders in a short form merger if Polycom were to acquire
at least 90% of the outstanding PictureTel shares in the offer or otherwise, including as a result of purchases by Polycom during any subsequent offering period.
If, however, we do not acquire at
least 90% of the then outstanding PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, and a vote of PictureTel's stockholders is required under the DGCL, a longer period of time will be required to
effect the merger. 

 
Appraisal Rights  

    
The offer does not entitle PictureTel stockholders to appraisal rights with respect to their PictureTel shares. 

    
The
merger does entitle PictureTel stockholders to appraisal rights with respect to their PictureTel shares. 

    
However,
if the merger is consummated, holders of PictureTel shares at the effective time of the merger will have certain rights pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL to demand appraisal of their PictureTel shares.
Under Section 262, stockholders who comply with the applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination
of the fair value of their PictureTel shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of such fair value in cash,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any.
Any such judicial determination of the fair value of PictureTel shares could be based upon factors other than, or in addition to, the price per
PictureTel share to be paid in the merger or the market value of the PictureTel shares.
The value so determined could be more or less than the price per PictureTel share to be paid in the merger. 

    
The
foregoing summary of Section 262 of the DGCL does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL, which is set forth in Annex B to this prospectus.
Stockholders who may wish to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law are urged to consult legal counsel for assistance in exercising their
rights.
Failure to comply completely and on a timely basis with all requirements of Section 262 for perfecting appraisal rights will result in the loss of those rights. 


Conditions of the Offer  

    The offer is subject to a number of conditions, which are described below: 

 Minimum Tender Condition  

    There must be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer a number of PictureTel shares which will constitute at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding PictureTel shares on a fully diluted basis, including for purposes of such calculation all shares issuable upon conversion of PictureTel's series B
preference stock and upon exercise of all vested PictureTel stock options and warrants and unvested stock options that are scheduled to vest, after giving effect to any acceleration that would occur
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, but excluding any shares held by PictureTel or any of its subsidiaries and excluding any shares issuable upon
conversion of any convertible notes issued to Polycom, as of the date that we accept the PictureTel shares pursuant to our offer.
Based on information supplied by PictureTel, the number of PictureTel
shares needed to satisfy the minimum tender condition would have been approximately 30,045,507 as of June 8, 2001. 

 
Regulatory Clearance Condition  

    The expiration of waiting periods under the HSR Act and applicable foreign merger notification statutes has not yet occurred, but required filings have been or
will be made in a timely manner. 

 
Registration Statement Effectiveness Condition  

    The registration statement on Form S-4 of which this prospectus is a part must have become effective under the Securities Act and not be the
subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order. 

 
Nasdaq Listing Condition  

    The shares of Polycom common stock issued to PictureTel stockholders in the offer and the merger must have been approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, or be exempt from such requirement under the then applicable laws, regulations and rules of Nasdaq.

agreement, on Polycom; 

which
in the reasonable good faith judgment of Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp., in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances, including any action or inaction by Polycom or Pharaoh

Regulatory Clearances  

    We and PictureTel have agreed pursuant to the merger agreement to use all reasonable efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals with respect to the offer and the merger.
Other than clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the offer and the merger which are described below, the SEC declaring the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part and the filing of a certificate of merger under the DGCL with respect to the merger, we do not believe that any
additional material governmental filings are required with respect to the offer and the merger. 

    
Under the HSR Act, and the related rules, the merger may not be completed until we and PictureTel notify and furnish information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied.
The notifications required under the HSR Act to the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice have been filed. 

    
We
and PictureTel also conduct operations in other countries where other regulatory filings or approvals may be required in connection with the completion of the offer or the merger.

We and PictureTel have made or will make all necessary filings required by the relevant regulatory authorities.
With respect to such filings, we cannot be certain that the relevant regulatory
approvals or consents will be granted and, if these approvals or consents are received, we cannot be certain as to the date of those approvals or consents.
In addition, we cannot be certain that we
will be able to cause PictureTel or its subsidiaries to satisfy or comply with those laws or that compliance or noncompliance will not have adverse consequences for PictureTel or any subsidiary of
PictureTel after purchase of the shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the offer or the merger. 


Possible Effects of Our Offer  

 Reduced Liquidity; Possibly no Longer Included for Quotation  

    The tender of PictureTel shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of PictureTel shares and the number of PictureTel shares that might
otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining PictureTel shares held by the public.
PictureTel shares are included for quotation and principally
traded on the Nasdaq National Market.
Depending on the number of PictureTel shares acquired pursuant to the offer, following consummation of the offer, PictureTel shares may no longer meet the
requirements of the Nasdaq National Market for continued quotation.
The NASD's requirements for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market, among other things, require that an issuer have
either: 

•
at
least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders of round lots, with a market value of at least $5 million and net tangible
assets of at least $4 million and at least two registered and active market makers for the shares; or

•
at
least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders of round lots, with a market value of at least $15 million and at least
four registered and active market markers, and either:

•
a
market capitalization of at least $50 million; or

•
total
assets and total revenue of at least $50 million each for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently
completed fiscal years. 

    
The
shares might nevertheless continue to be included in the Nasdaq National Market with quotations published in the Nasdaq "additional list" or in one of the "local lists," but if
the number of holders of the shares were to fall below 300, the number of publicly held shares were to fall below 500,000 or there were not at least two registered and active market makers for the
shares, the NASD's rules provide that the shares would no longer be "qualified" for Nasdaq reporting and Nasdaq would cease to provide any quotations.
Shares held directly or indirectly by directors,
officers or beneficial owners of more than 10% of the shares are not considered as being publicly held for this purpose.
If, following the closing of offer, the shares of PictureTel no longer meet the
requirements of the NASD for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market or in any other tier of Nasdaq and the shares were no longer included in the Nasdaq National Market or in any other tier
of Nasdaq, the market for PictureTel shares could be adversely affected. 

    
If the PictureTel shares no longer meet the requirements of the NASD for continued inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq, it is possible that the shares would continue to trade in the
over-the-counter market and that price quotations would be reported by other sources.
The extent of the public market for the PictureTel shares and the availability of
quotations for PictureTel shares would, however, depend upon the number of holders of shares remaining at that time, the interest in maintaining a market in PictureTel shares on the part of securities
firms, the possible termination of registration of the shares under the Exchange Act, as described below, and other factors.
We cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of PictureTel shares
that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the PictureTel shares. 

    
According
to PictureTel, there were, as of June 8, 2001, approximately 53,402,550 shares of PictureTel common stock outstanding. 

 
Status as "Margin Securities"  

    The PictureTel shares are presently "margin securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which has the effect, among other things, of
allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of PictureTel shares.
Depending on the factors similar to those described above with respect to market quotations, following consummation of the
offer, the PictureTel shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the PictureTel shares would not be eligible
as collateral for margin loans made by brokers. 

 
Registration Under the Exchange Act  

    PictureTel shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act.
PictureTel can terminate that registration upon application to the SEC if the outstanding
shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, quoted on an automated inter-dealer quotation system or if there are fewer than 300 holders of record of PictureTel shares.
Termination of
registration of the PictureTel shares under the Exchange Act would reduce the information that PictureTel must furnish to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of the
Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant to
Section 14(a) and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, no longer applicable with respect to PictureTel shares.
In addition, if PictureTel shares are no longer
registered under the Exchange Act, the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to "going-private" transactions would no longer be applicable to PictureTel.

Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of PictureTel and persons holding "restricted securities" of PictureTel to dispose of these securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may
be impaired or eliminated.
If registration of the shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, they would no longer be eligible for Nasdaq reporting or for continued inclusion on the Federal Reserve
Board's list of "margin securities." 


Source and Amount of Funds  

    The total amount of funds required by Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. to consummate the offer and the merger and to pay related fees and expenses is estimated to be
approximately $185 million.
Polycom will finance the offer and the merger with internally available funds. 


Relationships with PictureTel  

    Except as set forth in this prospectus, neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any

PictureTel shares and neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has effected any transaction in the PictureTel shares during the past
60 days other than as set forth below: 

    
On
June 15, 2001, Polycom purchased a Series A and a Series B senior convertible note, each of which is convertible into PictureTel common stock.
The terms of the
notes, including the conversion feature, are described in the section below under the heading "—Note Agreement and related documents." 

    
Except
as described or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, as of the date of this prospectus, there exists no material agreement, arrangement or understanding or any actual
or potential conflict of interest between PictureTel or its affiliates and (1) PictureTel's executive officers, directors or affiliates or (2) Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. or
their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates other than as follows: 

 Product Distribution Agreement  

    Accord Networks Ltd., now known as Polycom Israel Ltd., which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Polycom on February 28, 2001 and
PictureTel entered into a Product Distribution Agreement dated January 21, 2000, as amended on February 27, 2001.
Under the terms of the distribution agreement, PictureTel is authorized
to purchase, acquire and license certain of Polycom's network systems products for distribution and resale by PictureTel.
The parties also agreed that Polycom Israel would license certain PictureTel
Features in order to incorporate such PictureTel Features into certain of Polycom's network systems products for distribution by both PictureTel and Polycom.
The term of the distribution
agreement is thirty-six (36) months, and shall automatically continue thereafter for twelve (12) months unless either party gives the other written notice of its intent not
to renew
at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial or renewal term, or unless earlier terminated as otherwise provided in the distribution agreement. 

 
License Agreement  

    Polycom, PictureTel and PictureTel Technology Corp. have entered into the Siren Wideband Audio Codec License Agreement dated February 19, 2001.
Under
the terms of the license agreement, PictureTel and PictureTel Technology Corp. have agreed to license certain wideband audio speech coding technology relating to International Telecommunications Union
Recommendation ITV-T 6.722.1 in exchange for license fees and royalties. 

 
Confidentiality Agreement  

    PictureTel and Polycom entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement dated March 7, 2001 pursuant to which Polycom and PictureTel agreed not
to disclose the other's confidential 

information or to use the other's confidential information other than for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between Polycom and PictureTel.
Pursuant to the confidentiality agreement,
Polycom and PictureTel also agreed that for a period of eighteen (18) months they would not acquire, or make an offer to acquire, assets or property of the other or merge with the other without the
prior consent of the relevant board of directors.
The above summary and description are qualified in their entirety by reference to the confidentiality agreement, which is filed herewith as
Exhibit (e)(2) to PictureTel's Solicitation/Recommendation on Schedule 14D-9 and incorporated herein by reference. 


Accounting Treatment  

    Polycom's acquisition of PictureTel will be accounted for as a "purchase," as that term is used under United States generally accepted accounting principles,
commonly referred to as "GAAP", for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
PictureTel will be treated as the acquired corporation for these purposes.
PictureTel's assets, liabilities and other
items will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on the closing date of the acquisition and combined with the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Polycom.
Applicable income tax
effects of these adjustments will be included as a component of the combined company's deferred tax asset or liability.
The difference between the
estimated fair value of the assets, liabilities, in-process research and development expense and other items (adjusted as discussed above) and the purchase price will be recorded as goodwill, unearned
stock compensation, and other intangible assets and is expected to be amortized against the combined company's earnings over three years following completion of the merger or as a compensation expense
and is expected to be amortized over the vesting period of assumed options.
For further information concerning the amount of goodwill and other intangibles to be recorded in connection with the merger
and the amortization of the goodwill and other intangible assets, see "Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Statements on page 90." 

    
On
February 14, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure draft for public comment which proposes changing the method of accounting for goodwill
in a purchase transaction from capitalization and amortization against earnings to capitalization and periodic evaluation for impairment.
If this change were adopted by the FASB, unamortized goodwill
resulting from this transaction would be reported as an asset and not amortized against earnings unless it became impaired, at which time an immediate charge would be made in the financial statements
in accordance with SFAS 121, "Impairment of long-lived Assets."
The public comment period ended on March 16, 2001 and the FASB proposes to make this change effective July 2001; however,
there can be no assurance that the FASB will ever adopt this change or that any final standard will become effective in July 2001.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates  

    The shares of Polycom common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act.
These shares will be freely transferable under the
Securities Act, except for shares of Polycom common stock issued to any person who is an affiliate of PictureTel or Polycom.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of PictureTel or Polycom and may include some of their respective officers and directors, as well as their respective principal
stockholders.
Affiliates may not sell their shares of Polycom common stock acquired in the offer or the merger except pursuant to; 

•
an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares,

•
an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or

•
any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, PictureTel has delivered to Polycom affiliate
agreements executed by certain PictureTel affiliates that prohibit the sale, transfer or other disposition of Polycom common stock received by such PictureTel affiliate in the offer or the merger or

with the offer and the merger, subject to official notice of issuance. 


No Polycom Appraisal Rights

DGCL. 


INTERESTS OF PICTURETEL OFFICERS AND
  DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION    

    The
information contained in the Information Statement attached as Annex B to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 of PictureTel dated
June 18, 2001 is incorporated herein by reference. 


Treatment of Stock Options  

    Each outstanding option to purchase shares of PictureTel common stock, including options granted to PictureTel officers and directors, granted prior to May 24,
2001 will accelerate in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Further, the merger agreement provides that each outstanding option to purchase shares of PictureTel
common stock granted under the PictureTel 1998 Acquisition Stock Plan after May 24, 2001 will be assumed upon consummation of the merger by Polycom and shall thereafter be exercisable for that
number of shares of Polycom common stock equal to the number of shares of PictureTel common stock for which it is exercisable multiplied by the option exchange ratio and rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Polycom common stock.
In addition, the per share exercise price of each assumed option shall be determined by dividing the original exercise price by the option exchange
ratio and rounding up to the nearest whole cent.
The option exchange ratio will be equal to the sum obtained by adding 

•
0.1177
of a share of Polycom common stock and

•
the
quotient obtained by dividing $3.11 by the average closing sale price of one share of Polycom common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the five
(5) consecutive trading days ending immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 

    
The
following table sets forth, with respect to each of the executive officers and directors of PictureTel, 

•
the
number of shares of PictureTel common stock subject to options, other than options granted after May 24, 2001 under the 1998 Acquisition Stock
Plan, held by such persons that will be exercisable in connection with the offer (including options that are currently exercisable as well as options which will become exercisable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement);

•
the
range of exercise prices of the options held by such persons;

•
the
weighted average exercise price of the options held by such persons; and

•
the
cash value of all options held by such persons, calculated by subtracting the option exercise price from an assumed per share offer and merger
consideration of $5.63, which represents the sum of $3.11 and the product of 0.1177 multiplied by the closing sales price of Polycom common stock on June 14, 2001.
Any option with an exercise
price above $5.63 was disregarded for purposes of calculating cash value.

(1)
Includes
options which will become exercisable in connection with the offer.


(2)
Includes
options which will become exercisable if these individuals are deemed to no longer serve as directors of PictureTel following the consummation of the offer. 

    
In
the case of PictureTel stock options issued prior to May 24, 2001, all of which become exerciseable upon consummation of the offer, PictureTel and Polycom
have agreed to take steps to enable the holder thereof to exercise the option (including any portion thereof that first becomes exercisable in connection with the offer) on a basis that enables the
holder effectively to tender in the offer the shares acquired upon exercise, and in the case of any such option that is not an incentive stock option, to permit the holder of the option, in his or her
discretion, to tender the option (in lieu of exercising it) and receive the per share consideration offered in the offer payable with respect to the number of shares for which the option was
exercisable, net of the exercise price. 


Certain Executive Agreements  

    Immediately prior to the closing of the merger, Polycom will assume and agree to perform, in the same manner and to the same extent as PictureTel would have
been required to perform had the merger not been consummated, the change in control agreements entered into between PictureTel and certain individuals, including the following executive officers,
immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement.
Polycom also will cause PictureTel to perform its obligations under PictureTel's Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan and Special
Change in Control Severance Plan. 

    
In connection with the merger, we will assume certain obligations under PictureTel's executive officer and change in control agreements with the following employees of PictureTel.

These agreements we amended and restated at our request prior to the execution of the merger agreement.
Our obligations under these agreements will only be effective if we complete the merger with
PictureTel.

Indemnification  

    From and after the effective time of the merger, Polycom will cause the surviving corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    This section of the prospectus describes the merger agreement.
While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
The merger agreement is attached to this prospectus as Annex A, and we urge you to read it carefully. 


The Offer  

 Terms of the Offer  

    The merger agreement provides for the commencement by Pharaoh Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Polycom, of the offer to exchange all outstanding
shares of PictureTel common stock for cash and shares of Polycom common stock.
The merger agreement provides for the consideration that we will pay in the offer, including $3.11 in cash and 0.1177 of
a share of Polycom common stock for each share of PictureTel common stock.
The merger agreement provides that the initial expiration date of the offer is the twentieth business day following
commencement of the offer and that the offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the minimum tender condition.
For a description of those matters, refer to the discussion under "The Offer"
on page 48 of this prospectus. 

    
The
merger agreement prohibits Pharaoh Acquisition Corp., without the consent of PictureTel, from amending or waiving the minimum tender condition or amending the offer to decrease
the offer price or the cash portion or stock portion thereof, change the form or combination of consideration to be paid in the offer, reduce the number of shares to be purchased in the offer, amend
the conditions to the offer to broaden the scope of such conditions, add any additional conditions, or otherwise adversely affect the holders of the PictureTel shares, extend the offer except as
provided in the merger agreement, or amend or waive the minimum tender condition. 

 
Mandatory Extensions of the Offer  

    If any of the conditions to the offer are not satisfied and none of the events set forth under "The Offer—Conditions of the Offer—Other
Conditions of the Offer" on page 56 has occurred and is continuing at the time of any scheduled expiration date of the offer and such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied in
Polycom's and Pharaoh Acquisition Corp.'s sole judgement, Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. will extend the offer from time to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being satisfied
or any such event has occurred; provided that Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. is not required to extend the offer beyond February 24, 2002. 

 
Optional Extensions of the Offer  

    Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. has the right to extend the offer; 

•
at
the scheduled expiration date of the offer if any of the conditions to the offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions are satisfied or waived,

•
for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to the offer, or

•
if
the number of shares tendered pursuant to the offer is less than 90% of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock (on a fully-diluted basis) but
at least 80% of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock (on a fully-diluted basis),

•
for
any reason on one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than five (5) business days beyond the date on which the minimum tender
condition is satisfied if on such date there shall not have been tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at least 90% of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock on a fully-diluted basis. 

 
Prompt Payment for PictureTel Shares after the Closing of the Offer  

    Subject to the conditions of the offer, Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. will accept for payment and pay for, promptly after the expiration of the offer, all shares
of PictureTel common stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the offer. 


The Merger  

    The merger agreement provides that Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into PictureTel no later than the second business day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement unless the parties agree to another date.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each
share of PictureTel common stock will be converted into the right to receive from Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. $3.11 in cash and 0.1177 of a share of Polycom common stock for each share of PictureTel
common stock, the same per share consideration paid to holders of PictureTel common stock who exchanged their PictureTel shares in the offer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the merger consideration
will not be payable in respect of PictureTel shares held by PictureTel, Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. 

 Effective Time of the Merger  

    The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware or such later time as is agreed by
PictureTel and Polycom and specified in the certificate of merger.
The filing of the certificate of merger will take place as soon as practicable on or after the closing date of the merger. 


PictureTel Board Of Directors  

    Upon the acceptance for exchange of shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the offer, Polycom will be entitled to designate a number of directors of
PictureTel, rounded up to the next whole number, that equals the product of; 

•
the
total number of directors on PictureTel's board of directors, giving effect to the election of additional directors, and

•
the
percentage that the number of shares beneficially owned by Polycom and Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. bears to the total number of shares of PictureTel
common stock outstanding. 

    
PictureTel
shall use its best efforts to cause the individuals designated by Polycom to constitute the same percentage as is on the PictureTel board of directors of; 

•
each
committee of the PictureTel board of directors,

•
each
board of directors of each subsidiary of PictureTel, subject to legal requirements and except to the extent described in the PictureTel schedule to
the merger agreement, and

•
each
committee of each such board of directors. 

    
Until
the merger has become effective, PictureTel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the board of directors to include at least two members who were directors of
PictureTel prior to the
consummation of the offer.
The merger agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the merger, the affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing PictureTel directors will be required for
PictureTel to: 

•
amend
or terminate the merger agreement;

•
extend
the time for performance of Polycom's or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp.'s obligations under the merger agreement; or 

•
make
any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or not taken by PictureTel relating to the merger agreement. 


Treatment of PictureTel Stock Options and Warrants  

    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of PictureTel common stock and the PictureTel option plans
under which they were issued, except for options issued under the 1998 Acquisition Stock Plan after May 24, 2001 and the 1998 Acquisition Stock Plan, shall terminate. 

    
Prior
to the expiration of the offer, PictureTel has agreed to amend its 1998 Acquisition Stock Plan and form of option agreement thereunder to provide that with respect to the grants
of PictureTel stock options after May 24, 2001, the exercisability of such grants shall not accelerate as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer
and the merger, and, in connection with the merger agreement, such grants will be assumed by Polycom.
Prior to the expiration date, PictureTel shall make such grants in such numbers and pursuant to
such terms and conditions as shall be directed by Polycom at least five (5) business days prior to the expiration date provided, however, that the exercise price of such grants shall be equal
to the fair market value of PictureTel's common stock on the date of grant; and provided further, that the total number of shares of PictureTel common stock reserved for issuance as grants shall not
exceed 5,500,000 shares.
At the effective time of the merger, Polycom will assume such grants, and they will continue to have, and be subject to, the terms and conditions of such options immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger except that each will be solely exercisable, or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms, for that number of whole shares of Polycom common stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of PictureTel common stock that were issuable upon exercise of such grant immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by the option
exchange ratio described below, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Polycom common stock and the per share exercise price for the shares of Polycom common stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed grant will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of PictureTel common stock at which such grant was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by the option exchange ratio
described below, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

    
The
option exchange ratio will be equal to the sum obtained by adding; 

•
0.1177
of a share of Polycom common stock and

•
the
quotient obtained by dividing $3.11 by the average closing sale price of one share of Polycom common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the five
(5) consecutive trading days ending immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 

    
At
the effective time of the merger, each outstanding PictureTel warrant will become and represent, for each share of PictureTel common stock subject to a PictureTel warrant, the
right to receive a unit consisting of $3.11 in cash and 0.1177 of a share of Polycom common stock, and shall have an exercise price per such unit equal to the exercise price of such PictureTel warrant
per share of PictureTel common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
After the effective time of the merger, each PictureTel warrant will be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to it immediately prior to the effective time. 

    
In
the case of any holder of a PictureTel stock option, PictureTel and Polycom have agreed to take steps to enable the holder to exercise the option (including any portion thereof
that first becomes exercisable in connection with the offer) on a basis that enables the holder effectively to tender in the offer the shares acquired upon exercise, and in the case of any such option
that is not an incentive stock option, to permit the holder of the option, in his or her discretion, to tender the option (in lieu 

of exercising it) and receive the per share consideration offered in the offer payable with respect to the number of shares for which the option was exercisable, net of the exercise price. 


Treatment of Preference Stock  

    On the date Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. first accepts for payment shares tendered pursuant to the offer, the holders of series B preference stock of
PictureTel as of such date, to the extent that such shares shall not have previously been converted to common stock, shall be entitled to a payment equal to the purchase price each originally paid for
the series B preference stock upon issuance of such stock
together with, to the extent declared by PictureTel's board, cumulative but unpaid dividends thereon.
PictureTel shall cause to be sent to each holder of series B preference stock this
prospectus and related letter of transmittal as well as Polycom's Schedule TO and PictureTel's Schedule 14D-9 concurrently with, and in the same manner as, such are sent to the
holders of PictureTel common stock.
In addition, PictureTel shall cause to be sent to each holder of series B preference stock copies of any other documents filed with the SEC on a
non-confidential basis promptly following the filing of such documents with the SEC. 


Covenants and Representations and Warranties  

 Efforts  

    The merger agreement provides that each of Polycom and PictureTel will use its best efforts to take all reasonable actions, and cause to be done all things
reasonably necessary, to close the offer and the merger. 

 
Conduct of Business  

    PictureTel.
  
The merger agreement obligates PictureTel, until the first acceptance for exchange of shares of PictureTel
common stock pursuant to the offer or termination of the merger agreement, to conduct its operations in the ordinary course of business and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact
its present business, retain its present officers and employees and preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, licensees and others with whom it has significant

•

to the terms of existing option grants, purchases and sales of assets or the sale or redemption of outstanding securities of PictureTel, without
the prior written consent of Polycom. 

    
Polycom.
  
The merger agreement provides that until the earlier of the closing of the merger or the termination or the
merger agreement, Polycom shall not without the written consent of PictureTel, declare any dividends or other distributions on Polycom capital stock, split, combine or reclassify any capital stock or
authorize the issuance of any other securities unless the amount of stock to be received by PictureTel stockholders is appropriately adjusted. 

 
No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions  

    The merger agreement provides that, except in the circumstances described below, PictureTel will not, directly or indirectly: 

•
solicit,
initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);

•
participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information relating to PictureTel or any of its subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of PictureTel or any of its subsidiaries to any person that has made, or take any other action intended to assist or facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

•
engage
in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;

•
approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or 

•
enter
into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction (as defined below). 


However,
the merger agreement does provide that in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach by PictureTel of its obligations not to solicit alternative
transactions and following delivery to Polycom of notice of the Acquisition Proposal, PictureTel's board of directors may, subject to certain conditions: 

•
engage
or participate in discussions or negotiations with any third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the
PictureTel's board of directors reasonably concludes in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below),

•
furnish
to such third party nonpublic information relating to PictureTel or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to PictureTel than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between PictureTel and Polycom, and/or

•
following
receipt of such an Acquisition Proposal, withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendations and approve, endorse or recommend such
Acquisition Proposal; 

if,
in each case, 

•
the
PictureTel board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is necessary to take such action(s)
in order to satisfy its fiduciary duties to PictureTel's stockholders under Delaware law,

•
at
least three days prior to furnishing any such information to, or entering into any such discussions or negotiations with, such person or group,
PictureTel gives Polycom written notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of PictureTel's intention to furnish
nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, and

•
contemporaneously
with furnishing any such information to such person or group, PictureTel furnishes such information to Polycom. 

    
"Acquisition
Transaction" means any offer or proposal by a third party relating to: 

•
any
acquisition or purchase from PictureTel by any person or group of more than 15% of the outstanding voting securities of PictureTel or any of its
subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting securities of PictureTel or any of
its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving PictureTel pursuant to which the stockholders of PictureTel immediately preceding that transaction
would hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of that transaction;

•
any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition,
or disposition of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of PictureTel; or

•
any
liquidation or dissolution of PictureTel. 

    
"Acquisition
Proposal" means any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Transaction. 

    
"Superior
Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal involving the acquisition of all of PictureTel's outstanding voting securities with respect to which PictureTel's board of directors
has reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of a nationally recognized standing) taking into account, among other things, the legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the party making such Acquisition Proposal, that the acquiring party is 

capable of consummating the proposed Acquisition Transaction on the terms proposed, and which, if any cash consideration is involved, shall not be subject to any financing contingency, and that the
proposed Acquisition Transaction would, if consummated, be more favorable to the PictureTel's stockholders (in their capacities as such), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. 

 
Antitrust Laws  

    As soon as may be reasonably practicable, Polycom and PictureTel each shall make the filings required under any applicable antitrust laws in connection with
the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
Polycom and PictureTel each shall cooperate and coordinate with one another in the making of such filings, supply the other with any information which may be
required in order to effectuate such filings, and supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or the competition or
merger control authorities of any other governmental entity.
Polycom shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Polycom or PictureTel or any of Polycom's subsidiaries or affiliates of any
assets, properties and stock, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Polycom or PictureTel or any of Polycom's subsidiaries or affiliates to conduct their businesses or to own or
exercise control of their assets, properties and stock. 

 
No Rights Plan Amendment  

    Prior to the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the closing of the merger, PictureTel and the PictureTel board shall not amend or modify or
take any other action with regard to the PictureTel rights plan in any manner or take another action so as to: 

•
render
the PictureTel rights plan inapplicable to any transaction(s) other than the offer, the merger and other transactions contemplated by this agreement
and the PictureTel tender and voting agreements, or

•
permit
any person or group (other than Polycom, Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. or any of their affiliates) who would otherwise be an acquiring person, as
defined in the PictureTel rights plan, not to be an acquiring person, or

•
provide
that a distribution date or a stock acquisition date, as such terms are defined in the PictureTel rights plan, or similar event does not occur as
promptly as practicable by reason of the execution of any agreement or transaction other than this agreement and the PictureTel tender and voting agreements and the offer, the merger and the
agreements and transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or

•
except
as specifically contemplated by this agreement, otherwise affect the rights of holders of rights. 

 
Product Support Statement  

    In connection with all press releases relating to the merger agreement or the offer, Polycom and PictureTel agreed to make public statements, to be
communicated in writing by each party to their respective sales forces and others, that: Polycom's belief in the iPower PC architecture and PictureTel's belief in the Viewstation's architecture are
significant factors in their decision to enter into the merger
agreement as it rounds out their respective product lines allowing them to address increasing customer demand for a broad range of video communication products for the expanding IP and
circuit-switched broadband networks and after the consummation of the offer and the merger, in addition to its Viewstation products, Polycom intends to sell and support PictureTel's iPower PC based
products, and to develop next generation appliance and PC products that leverage the best of breed features and 

functionality of the Viewstation and iPower PC platforms.
In connection with all press releases relating to the merger agreement or the offer, both Polycom and PictureTel agreed to state their
respective individual beliefs that appliance and PC based architectures are needed to exploit pent up demand.
Polycom agreed that it will not issue press releases or make other public statements, or
give instructions to its sales force, in contravention of the above obligations.
Polycom and PictureTel acknowledged that the agreements regarding product support are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

 
Employee Benefits  

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, we have agreed to give credit under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by us
or the surviving corporation (other than sabbatical benefits) to each employee of PictureTel or its subsidiaries for all service with PictureTel or its subsidiaries.
In addition, Polycom will cause
the surviving corporation to provide benefits (including health benefits, severance policies, 401(k) plans and general employment policies and procedures, subject to the terms and conditions of such
plans) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to benefits that are available to similarly situated employees of Polycom and its subsidiaries as of May 24, 2001, provided, however,
that such insurance carriers, outside providers or the like are able to provide such benefits on terms reasonably acceptable to Polycom, and provided, further, that nothing shall prevent the surviving
corporation or any of its subsidiaries from making any change required by applicable law, and provided, further, that it shall not result in any duplication of benefits. 

    
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
  
PictureTel shall take steps necessary to terminate its employee
stock purchase plan and 1999 Foreign Subsidiary Stock Purchase Plan on the earlier to occur of the expiration date of the offer or August 31, 2001.
In the event the plans are terminated on the
expiration date, the exercise date for outstanding purchase rights under the plans shall be accelerated to enable participants effectively to exercise and tender in the offer shares acquired upon
exercise. 

    
Benefit Plans.
  
PictureTel shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the
date PictureTel becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations, as defined in Section 414(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as Polycom, any and all 401(k)
plans unless Polycom provides notice to PictureTel that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated.
To the extent permitted by Polycom's applicable plan and otherwise practicable, Polycom shall take
appropriate steps to enable continuing employees to roll over distributions from the terminated plans to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans maintained by Polycom or an
affiliate.

Termination by Either Polycom or PictureTel  

    The merger agreement may be terminated by either Polycom or PictureTel by giving notice of termination to the non-terminating party: 

•
at
a time prior to the effective time of the merger if:

•
the
offer expires or terminates in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. having accepted for

of the merger agreement by Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp.;

•
the
offer has not been consummated on or before February 24, 2002, unless the failure to consummate the offer is principally caused by or results
from the failure to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement of the party seeking termination and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement; or

•
there
shall be any applicable law or regulation that makes consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any judgment, injunction, order or

adverse effect on the non-terminating party, in either case that is not curable by the non-terminating party through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts; or 

•
at
any time prior to the acceptance for exchange by Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. of shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the offer, if the
non-terminating party materially breaches 

any
covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement, or any representation or warranty of the non-terminating party contained in the merger agreement was when made or becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that, overall, the untruths or inaccuracies would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the non-terminating party, if that untruth or inaccuracy has not been or is incapable of being cured by the non-terminating party within
30 days following receipt by the non-terminating party of written notice from the terminating party of the untruth or inaccuracy or breach or the non-terminating party
ceases to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such untruth or inaccuracy or breach. 

 
Termination by Polycom  

    Polycom can terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the first acceptance of shares of PictureTel common stock in the offer by Polycom if: 

•
the
PictureTel board of directors, or any of its committees, approves or recommends to the PictureTel stockholders any Acquisition Proposal;

•
the
PictureTel board of directors, or any of its committees, for any reason withholds, withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation in favor of the
offer, the adoption and approval of the merger agreement or the approval of the merger;

•
PictureTel
fails to include the recommendation of the PictureTel board of directors described in the bullet point directly above in the
Schedule 14D-9, the Schedule TO and this prospectus;

•
PictureTel
enters into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or commitment, other than a confidentiality agreement as
permitted by the merger agreement, accepting any Acquisition Proposal;

•
a
tender or exchange offer is commenced by a person unaffiliated with Polycom, and PictureTel does not send to its stockholders pursuant to certain rules
under the Exchange Act, within 10 business days of the day that the offer is first published, sent or given, a statement that PictureTel recommends rejection of that tender or exchange offer and
reaffirming the recommendations described in the second bullet point above; or

•
PictureTel
breaches the provisions regarding nonsolicitation contained in the merger agreement in any material respect. 

 
Termination by PictureTel  

    PictureTel may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the first acceptance for exchange of shares of PictureTel common stock pursuant to the
offer, to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that: 

•
PictureTel
is not in breach of its obligations under the conditions listed below and under the nonsolicitation provisions of the merger agreement and
continues to comply with all such obligations in all respects;

•
the
PictureTel board of directors has authorized, subject to complying with the terms of the merger agreement, PictureTel to enter into a definitive
written agreement for a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal;

•
PictureTel
notifies Polycom in writing that it has received a Superior Proposal and intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to that
Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of that agreement to the notice;

•
Polycom
does not make, within three business days after receipt of PictureTel's written notice of its intention to enter into a definitive agreement for a
Superior Proposal, an offer that the 

PictureTel
board of directors in good faith reasonably determines, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable
to PictureTel's stockholders as such Superior Proposal; 

•
during
that period PictureTel has informed Polycom of the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person making such
Superior Proposal, with the intent of enabling both parties to agree to a modification of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
may be effected;

•
prior
to PictureTel's termination under these circumstances, PictureTel pays to Polycom the termination fee as described below under
"—Termination Fee"; and

•
following
such termination PictureTel enters into a definitive agreement to effect the Superior Proposal. 


Termination Fee  

    If the merger agreement is either terminated: 

•
by
Polycom or PictureTel prior to the effective date of the merger as described under the first or second bullets of the first paragraph of
"—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Polycom or PictureTel" or as a result of a material adverse effect on PictureTel; or

•
by
PictureTel as described under "—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by PictureTel," 

then
PictureTel shall be required to pay to Polycom a termination fee in an amount equal to $14,500,000 million in immediately available funds.
However, if Polycom or PictureTel terminates the
merger agreement as described in the first or second paragraph under "—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by either Polycom or PictureTel" prior to which no event
described under "—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Polycom" has occurred, then such payment shall be made only if, (i) after the date of the merger
agreement and prior to the date of termination of the merger agreement any Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or has become publicly known and not withdrawn at least 5 business days
prior to the termination by PictureTel, and (ii) within 9 months following termination of the merger agreement either a Company Acquisition occurs or PictureTel enters into an agreement
providing for a Company Acquisition and such Company Acquisition is later consummated.
If a payment is required under the foregoing sentence, then PictureTel shall promptly pay to Polycom, no later
than one day after the consummation of such Company Acquisition, $14,500,000 in immediately available funds. 

    
For
purposes of the preceding paragraph, "Company Acquisition" means any of the following transactions, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement: 

•
a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving PictureTel pursuant to which the
PictureTel stockholders immediately preceding that transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of the transaction;

•
a
sale or other disposition by PictureTel of a business or assets representing 50% or more of the aggregate fair market value of PictureTel's business
immediately prior to such sale consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of PictureTel immediately prior to such sale; or

•
the
acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by PictureTel, directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of PictureTel. 


Extensions, Waivers and Amendments  

    The merger agreement may be amended by a written instrument signed on behalf of Polycom and PictureTel at any time.
The merger agreement provides that if
Polycom designates directors of PictureTel, any amendment of the merger agreement, any termination of the merger agreement by PictureTel, any extension by PictureTel of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Polycom or Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. under the merger agreement, waiver by PictureTel of any rights of PictureTel under the merger agreement or any other
determination with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by PictureTel relating to the merger agreement, will require the concurrence of a majority of the PictureTel directors then in
office who were not designated by Polycom. 

    
At
any time prior to the effective time of the merger, any party to the merger agreement may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth in the merger agreement, 

•
extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,

•
waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and

•
waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. 

    
Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
Delay in
exercising any right under the merger agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. 

AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    This section of the prospectus describes agreements related to the merger agreement, including the PictureTel voting and tender agreements.
While we believe
that these descriptions cover the material terms of these agreements, these summaries may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
These agreements are attached to this prospectus
as part of Annex A, and we urge you to read them carefully. 


PictureTel Voting and Tender Agreements  

 Parties  

    As an inducement for Polycom and Pharaoh Acquisition Corp. to enter into the merger agreement, immediately prior to the signing of the merger agreement,
PictureTel's directors and executive officers entered into voting and tender agreements with Polycom. 

    
The
obligations of those stockholders under the voting and tender agreements cover, in the aggregate, 2,468,274 PictureTel shares (after giving effect to the exercise of all of their
options with an exercise price not greater than $5.63 and conversion of their outstanding preference stock), which represented approximately 4.4% of the outstanding PictureTel shares as of
June 8, 2001, (approximately 4.11% after giving effect to all options which will become exercisable if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated and the conversion
of all outstanding preference stock). 

 
Agreement to Tender  

    Each stockholder who signed a voting and tender agreement agreed to tender in the offer and not withdraw his or her shares. 

 
Proxy  

    Each stockholder who signed a voting and tender agreement granted Polycom or any nominee of Polycom a proxy to vote or grant a consent with respect to that
stockholder's PictureTel shares: 

•
in
favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

•
against
the approval of any Acquisition Proposal;

•
against
any merger, consolidation, business combination or sale of assets of PictureTel with any party other than Polycom;

•
against
the reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or winding up of PictureTel or any other extraordinary transaction involving PictureTel;

•
against
the corporate action that would prevent or delay consummation of the offer, the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement; or

•
against
any other matters relating to the foregoing. 

 
Termination  

    All obligations under the voting and tender agreements terminate upon the earlier of; 

•
the
effective time of the merger, or

•
the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. 


Affiliate Agreements  

    Each executive officer and director of PictureTel entered into an agreement with Polycom under which: 

•
Such
affiliate acknowledged that he, she or it was sole record and beneficial owner of the shares referenced therein; had no obligation to sell or deliver
such shares to any party; and owned no other shares than such shares.


•
Such
affiliate acknowledged that his, her or its shares of Polycom Common Stock issued in connection with the Offer or the Merger would be subject to the
restrictions set forth in Rule 145 and, accordingly, such affiliate agreed not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such Polycom Common Stock unless the sale, transfer or other disposition
is made in compliance with the requirements of Rule 145(d), is made pursuant to an effective registration statement or an appropriate exemption, or is made in reliance upon a written opinion of
counsel delivered to Polycom that such sale, transfer or disposition is otherwise exempt from registration. 


Note Agreement and Related Documents  

    In connection with the merger agreement, PictureTel and Polycom have entered into a note agreement.
Under the terms of the note agreement, PictureTel issued to
Polycom a Series A senior convertible note, referred to as the Series A Note, having an original principal amount of $6,600,000 and a Series B senior convertible note having an
original principal amount of $34,900,000, referred to as the Series B Note.

PictureTel has granted a security interest in favor of Polycom on substantially all of its assets to secure its obligations under the notes.
PictureTel's obligations to Polycom under the notes are
subordinated to the obligations of PictureTel to Congress Financial Corporation (New England) under the Loan and Security Agreement dated August 21, 2000. 

    
In
addition, Polycom has obtained a letter of credit to back letters of credit issued by Congress Financial Corporation (New England) on behalf of PictureTel, or Back-up LC.
The face
amount of the letter of credit obtained by Polycom is $8,400,000 and the face amount declines over time as the letters of credit it is backing expire. 

 
Notes  

    The principal amount of each note is convertible into common stock of PictureTel at any time after the termination of the merger agreement and prior to the
repayment in full of the principal amount of the note.
The conversion rate is 222.22 shares of common stock for each $1,000 in principal amount of the note, except that if the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed for certain reasons, the conversion rate is 164.74 shares of common stock for each $1,000 in principal amount.
The conversion rate is subject to
adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events described in the notes, including dividends and distributions, the issuance of options having an exercise price less than the current
market price per share of PictureTel's common stock, subdivisions and combinations of PictureTel's common stock and other distributions to holders of PictureTel's common stock. 

    
Interest
on each note may be paid in cash or in kind by issuing a note in substantially the form as the Series A Note or the Series B Note, as applicable, except that
the payment in kind note is not convertible. 

    
The
notes are subject to redemption at the election of PictureTel, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
In addition, the holder of the notes may require PictureTel to repurchase them upon a change in control or the repurchase events described in the notes.

The repurchase events arise from the termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances. 

    
Prior to the termination of the merger agreement, PictureTel has agreed to comply with the provisions of the merger agreement governing conduct by PictureTel of its business and
operations.
After the termination of the merger agreement and until the obligations under each note is paid in full, PictureTel must comply with covenants regarding: 

•
maintenance
of existence, good standing and foreign qualifications;

•
compliance
with applicable statutes, regulations and orders;

•
payment
of taxes;

•
maintenance
of insurance;

•
delivery
of financial statements;

•
restrictions
on investments;

•
restrictions
on dividends, distributions and redemptions on its equity securities; and

•
payments
or distributions in cash to stockholders or affiliates outside the ordinary course of business. 

    
The
notes contain the following events of default: 

•
default
in the payment of interest, or principal in the case of the Series B Note, when due and payable, and the continuance of such default for a
period of 30 days;

•
default
in the performance by PictureTel of its obligations in respect of the conversion of a note for a period of five days;

•
failure
by PictureTel to give notice of a change in control;

•
default
in the performance or breach of any covenant of PictureTel, other than the covenant to comply with the conduct of business provisions of the merger
agreement, and the continuance of the default or breach for 45 days after notice is given to PictureTel;

•
default
under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for borrowed money by PictureTel with a principal amount then outstanding in
excess of $1,000,000 constituting a failure to pay principal or otherwise resulting in the acceleration of the principal amount of the indebtedness, and the indebtedness is not discharged or the
acceleration rescinded or annulled within 30 days after notice is given to PictureTel;

•
the
entry of a decree or order with respect to PictureTel or any of its significant subsidiaries in respect of involuntary proceedings under bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws;

•
commencement
by PictureTel or any of its significant subsidiaries of a voluntary case under bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws; or

•
the
entry of one or more judgments, orders or decrees against PictureTel and/or its significant subsidiaries involving a liability of $500,000 or more in
the aggregate and such judgment, order or decree is not vacated, discharged or stayed or bonded pending appeal within 30 days after its entry. 

    
Each
note limits the ability of the holder to exercise its rights to require a repurchase of the note or to accelerate the obligations under the note to the extent that doing so
causes the cash and cash
equivalents of PictureTel to be less than its current liabilities, in each case determined on a consolidated basis.
Further, each note provides that the holder will not join with other creditors to
commence an involuntary case or proceeding against PictureTel under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar law. 

 
Series A Note  

    The principal amount of the Series A Note is subject to increase from time to time to the extent of any draws on the Back-up LC obtained by Polycom, up
to a maximum principal amount of $15,000,000.
Interest accrues at the rate of 8% per annum and is payable quarterly.
The principal amount of the Series A Note is due on June 15, 2003. 

 
Series B Note  

    The proceeds of the Series B Note are held in an account in which Polycom has a first priority security interest subject to no other liens.
The note
agreement permits PictureTel to withdraw funds from the account as follows: 

•
up
to $2,000,000 for the quarters ended June 30, 2001, September 30, 2001, December 31, 2001 and March 31, 2001, and up to
$6,000,000 in the aggregate, based on PictureTel's net revenue, operating expenses and cash;

•
up
to $9,000,000 if the offer is extended beyond February 24, 2002; and

•
the
remaining balance in the account if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. 

    
Interest
on the Series B Note is payable quarterly and accrues at the rate of 8% per annum, except to the extent funds are held in the account, interest accrues on the funds at
a rate equal to the interest payable on the account.
To the extent not automatically converted pursuant to the terms of the note, the principal of the Series B Note is payable in four quarterly
installments, with the final installment due on May 31, 2005. 

 
Registration Rights Agreement  

    PictureTel has agreed to file a registration statement registering the resale of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes on or before
September 12, 2001 and has agreed to use its commercial best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective no later than the later of 90 days after the
registration statement is initially filed or immediately after the termination of the merger agreement.
If PictureTel does not continuously use its best efforts to cause the registration statement to
be declared effective, additional interest will accrue on the notes as set forth in the registration rights agreement. 

 
Voting Agreement  

    Polycom has agreed that, after the termination of the merger agreement, the shares of PictureTel common stock underlying the notes will be voted
proportionately with all other votes cast by PictureTel's stockholders on matters relating to the election of directors, mergers and dividends, stock issuances and charter amendments.
The voting
agreement also provides PictureTel with a right of first refusal on the sale of the notes and the shares of PictureTel common stock underlying the notes.
This right of first refusal with respect to
the shares of common stock terminates on the earlier of December 20, 2001 or 90 days after the registration statement registering the resale of the common stock issuable upon conversion
of the notes is filed. 


UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
  COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared to give effect to the acquisition of PictureTel by
Polycom using the purchase method of accounting.
These pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements were prepared as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1,
2000 for statement of operations purposes and as of March 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes. 

    
The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position
or results of operations that would have actually been reported had the acquisition occurred at March 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes and as of January 1, 2000 for statement of
operations purposes, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of operations.
The pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements include
adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of purchase consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities of PictureTel, before any integration or
restructuring adjustments.
The final allocation of the purchase consideration will be determined after the completion of the acquisition and will be based on appraisals and a comprehensive final
evaluation of the fair value of the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at the time of the acquisition as considered appropriate.
The final
determination of tangible and intangible assets may result in depreciation and amortization expenses that may be materially different from the preliminary estimates of these amounts.
The pro forma
adjustments are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of the filing of this prospectus.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements do not
include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that may result from the merger. 

    
These
unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are based upon the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Polycom (as restated to
include the accounts and results of operations of Accord Networks, Ltd. acquired by Polycom on February 28, 2001, treated as a pooling of interests, see Form 8-K filed
on June 15, 2001, incorporated herein by reference in this prospectus) and PictureTel and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Polycom (as
restated) and PictureTel and related notes thereto, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Polycom" (as restated) and "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of PictureTel" contained in the reports and other information Polycom and PictureTel have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
  COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION  

    On May 24, 2001 Polycom and PictureTel entered into an agreement under which Polycom will acquire PictureTel.
Under the terms of the agreement, Polycom
will acquire all of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock for a combination of 0.1177 shares of Polycom common stock and $3.11 in cash for each outstanding share of PictureTel common
stock.
Polycom expects to issue approximately 6.4 million shares of its common stock and approximately $179 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock
and assume PictureTel options exercisable for approximately 1.3 million shares of Polycom common stock.
Completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt by Polycom of offers to
tender a majority of PictureTel's diluted common stock, among other conditions.
The actual number of shares of Polycom common stock, options and cash to be issued will be determined on the effective
date of the acquisition based upon the number of shares of PictureTel common stock and options actually outstanding on such date.
Polycom intends to account for the transaction as a purchase. 


2.  PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE  

    The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately
$393 million, consisting of cash and Polycom common stock to be issued valued using the average fair value of Polycom's outstanding common stock from May 22, 2001 to May 29, 2001,
five trading days surrounding the date the acquisition agreement was announced, and the fair value of the options and warrant to be issued by Polycom in the acquisition, and other costs directly
related to the acquisition as follows (in thousands): 

Cash

$

179,400

Fair value of Polycom's common stock

181,000

Fair value of options and warrant assumed

25,600

Estimated acquisition related costs

7,000

Total consideration

$

393,000

    The
estimated purchase price excludes the impact, if any, of the Note Agreement entered into as part of the Merger Agreement. 

    
For
purposes of computing the estimated fair value of the options and warrant assumed, the Black-Scholes pricing model was used with the following assumptions: fair value of Polycom's
stock of $28.21, expected life of 5.5 years, risk free rate of 5.5%, expected dividend yield of 0% and volatility of 90%. 

    
The
final purchase price is dependent on the actual number of shares of common stock exchanged, the actual number of options and warrant assumed, and actual acquisition related costs.

The final 

purchase price will be determined upon completion of the acquisition.
The preliminary purchase price allocation, which is subject to change based on Polycom's final analysis, is as follows (in
thousands): 

Tangible assets acquired

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS  

Balance Sheet:

    The
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet has been prepared as if the acquisition was completed on March 31, 2001 and reflects the
following pro forma adjustments: 

(a)

To
record estimated direct acquisition costs of approximately $7 million to be incurred by Polycom and approximately $7.5 million of estimated transaction costs to be
incurred by PictureTel.


(b)
To
adjust the PictureTel deferred revenue, accounts receivables and inventory to estimated fair value.


(c)
To
eliminate the historical stockholders' equity and redeemable convertible preferred stock of PictureTel, and record cash paid and Polycom shares issued in the acquisition.


(d)

To
record sale of short-term investments for cash payment on purchase.


(e)
To
eliminate intercompany receivable and payable balances.


(f)
To
record in-process research and development, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the purchase.


(g)
To
eliminate valuation allowances on PictureTel net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. 


Statement of Operations:

    The
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition was completed as of January 1, 2000 and
reflects the following pro forma adjustments: 

(a)

To
record the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition on a straight line basis.
Goodwill and other intangibles are expected to be
amortized over three years.
A proposed FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards on Business Combinations would eliminate goodwill amortization.
(See accounting treatment)

(b)
To
eliminate intercompany transactions relating to the sale and purchase of products. 


(c)
To
adjust provision for taxes applying Polycom's effective tax rate on pro forma combined loss before taxes.


(d)
To
reclassify PictureTel general and administrative expenses from sales and marketing to conform to Polycom's financial statement presentation.


(e)
To
eliminate interest income on cash and investment balances used in acquisition. 


4.  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE DATA  

    Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma combined net loss per share, were computed by adding 6.4 million shares assumed to be issued in exchange
for the outstanding PictureTel shares to Polycom's basic weighted average shares outstanding.
As the pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented shows
a combined net loss, weighted average basic and diluted shares are the same. 


COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF PICTURETEL COMMON STOCK 
  AND POLYCOM COMMON STOCK    

    This section of the prospectus describes certain differences between PictureTel common stock and Polycom common stock.
While we believe that the description
covers the material differences between the two, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to PictureTel stockholders, including the complete text of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Polycom and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of PictureTel.
PictureTel stockholders should read this entire document and the other documents referred to
carefully for a more complete understanding of the differences between PictureTel common stock and Polycom common stock. 

    
PictureTel's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws currently govern the rights of stockholders of PictureTel.
After the completion of the merger, PictureTel's stockholders will
become stockholders of Polycom.
As a result, former PictureTel stockholders' rights will be governed by Polycom's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
The following paragraphs summarize certain
differences between the rights of Polycom stockholders and PictureTel stockholders under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Polycom and certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
PictureTel. 


Polycom Common Stock  

    Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any class or series of capital stock with prior rights as to dividends that may be issued in the future, the
holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.
There are no redemption or
sinking fund provisions available to the common stock.
The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders, but must take actions at a
duly called annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders.
175,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0005 per share, are authorized and, as of June 7, 2001, there were 83,851,448
shares of common stock outstanding. 


PictureTel Common Stock  

    The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends on their shares of stock when and as declared by PictureTel's board of directors.
The holders of
common stock are entitled to one vote per share.
80,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, are authorized, and as of June 8, 2001, there were 53,402,550 shares of common stock
outstanding. 


Polycom Preferred Stock  

    Polycom's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock, and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designations of such series,
without any further vote or action by the stockholders.
Such issued preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock.
The issuance of preferred
stock may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Polycom.
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share are authorized and, at present, there
are no outstanding shares of preferred stock and Polycom has no present plans to issue preferred stock. 

    
On
July 15, 1998, Polycom issued to holders of Polycom common stock, rights to purchase Polycom preferred stock pursuant to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement of the same
date between Polycom and Fleet Bank N.A., as rights agent, as amended March 2, 2001.
Under the terms of the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, the preferred stock purchase rights will become
exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including the acquisition by an acquiring person of 20% of the outstanding shares of Polycom Common Stock.
The preferred stock purchase
rights also entitle the 

stockholders to acquire stock of the acquiring person under certain circumstances.
The existence of the stockholder rights plan may discourage or render more difficult an acquisition of Polycom that
is deemed undesirable by Polycom's board of directors. 


PictureTel Preferred Stock  

    PictureTel's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preference stock in one or more series, to fix the designations,
preferences, powers and rights of these series, without any vote of the stockholders.

share.
As of June 8, 2001, no shares of series A preference stock were issued and outstanding.

Under
PictureTel's bylaws, a special meeting of stockholders may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president, or by the board of directors. 


Stockholder Action without a Meeting  

    Under Section 228 of the DGCL, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at a meeting
of stockholders of a corporation may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action to be taken is signed by the minimum number of holders of outstanding stock necessary
to take such action.
Polycom's bylaws prohibit stockholders from taking any action without a meeting.
PictureTel's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not prohibit stockholders from taking an
action without a meeting. 


Bylaw Amendments  

    Section 109 of the DGCL provides that the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws shall be in the stockholders entitled to vote.
A corporation may, in
its certificate of incorporation, confer such powers on the board of directors.
Under the Polycom charter, the Polycom board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the bylaws of
Polycom.

the terms of the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, the preferred stock purchase rights will become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including the
acquisition by an acquiring person of 20% of the outstanding shares of Polycom common stock.
The preferred stock purchase rights also entitle the stockholders to acquire stock of the acquiring person
under certain circumstances.
The existence of the stockholder rights plan may discourage or render more difficult an acquisition of Polycom that is deemed undesirable by Polycom's board of directors. 


PictureTel Stockholder Rights Plan  

    On March 25, 1992, PictureTel's board of directors declared a dividend of one junior preference stock purchase right for each outstanding share of
PictureTel common stock to the stockholders of record on April 7, 1992.
The junior preference stock purchase rights are governed by the Rights Agreement, dated as of March 25, 1992, and
as amended January 13, 1995 and July 24, 2000, between PictureTel and Fleet National Bank. 

    
Under
the terms of the rights agreement, the junior preference stock purchase rights will become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including the
acquisition by an acquiring person of 15% of the outstanding shares of PictureTel common stock.
The junior preference stock purchase rights also entitle the stockholders to acquire stock of the
acquiring person under certain circumstances.
The existence of the rights agreement may discourage or render more difficult an acquisition of PictureTel that is deemed undesirable by PictureTel's
board of directors.
PictureTel has amended this agreement so that it will not apply to the offer and merger.

Stock
Portion
") (such Cash Portion and Stock Portion being hereinafter referred to as the "
Offer Price
"), in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions provided herein; 

    C.  Also
in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the

    D.  Concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) all executive

Amendment
") the Rights Agreement between Company and the First National Bank of Boston as Rights Agent dated March 25, 1992, as amended (the

"), to render the Rights thereunder inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Company Tender and Voting Agreements; and 

    E.  Following
the execution of this Agreement, Company may issue to Parent a Senior Convertible Note—Series A and a Senior Convertible
Note—Series B (collectively, the "

"), pursuant to a Note Agreement to be entered into between Company and Parent
(the "

A–1

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I
  
THE OFFER    

    1.1
  The Offer.

    
(a) Provided
that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and (ii) none of the events set forth in Annex A
hereto that would entitle Parent and Merger Sub to fail to consummate the Offer shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
Exchange Act
")), the Offer for any
and all of the Shares, at the Offer Price.
The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment
and to pay for any Shares tendered) shall be subject only to (i) the condition that at least a majority of Shares on a fully-diluted basis (including for purposes of such calculation all Shares
issuable upon conversion of the Company's Series A Preference Stock and Series B Preference Stock and upon exercise of all vested
Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 6.8(a)) and Company Warrants (as defined in Section 2.6(c)) and unvested Company Stock Options that are scheduled to vest (after giving
effect to any acceleration that would occur as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) prior to the End Date (as defined in Section 8.1, but excluding
any Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and excluding any Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes) be validly tendered (the "
Minimum
Condition
"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex A. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; 

provided, however
, that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, no change may be made that
(i) decreases the Offer Price or the Cash Portion or the Stock Portion thereof, (ii) changes the form or combination of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the
number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amends the conditions set forth in Annex A to broaden the scope of such conditions, add any additional conditions, or otherwise adversely
affect the holders of Shares, (v) extends the Offer except as provided in Section 1.1(b), or (vi) amends or waives the Minimum Condition.
It is agreed that the conditions set
forth in Annex A are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, other
than the Minimum Condition, as to which prior written Company approval is required.
The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. 

    
(b) Subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days after the
date the Offer is commenced; 
provided, however
, that without the consent of the Company's Board of Directors (the "
Company
Board
"), Merger Sub may (i) from time to time extend the Offer, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived; (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
SEC
") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; (iii) if the number of Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer is less than 90% of the outstanding Shares (on a fully-diluted basis) but at least 80% of the outstanding Shares (on a fully-diluted basis), extend the Offer for any reason on 

A–2

one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than five (5) business days beyond the date on which the Minimum Condition is satisfied if on such date there shall not have been
tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at least 90% of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis; or (iv) include a subsequent offering period (as such term is defined in
Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act) to the Offer for a period up to twenty (20) business days.
Parent and Merger Sub agree that, if any one or more of the conditions to the
Offer set forth on Annex A are not satisfied and none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a) through (i) of Annex A that would permit Merger Sub not to accept tendered Shares for
payment has occurred and is continuing at the time of any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then, 
provided
 that such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied in Parent and Merger Sub's sole judgement, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being satisfied
or any such event has occurred; 
provided, however
, that in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond February 24, 2002.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer.
No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued in connection with the payment of the Stock Portion upon consummation of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) in the Offer shall receive from Parent an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock on
the first date Merger Sub accepts Shares for exchange in the Offer, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market ("
Nasdaq
").
With respect to any such
Shares the Cash Portion shall be net to the seller thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by such seller.

Upon the issuance of any Parent Common Stock in the Offer, and consistent with, pursuant to and subject to Parent's existing Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of September 15, 1998
(as the same may be amended from time to time, the "
Parent Rights Agreement
"), between Parent and BankBoston N.A., as rights agent, one right issuable
pursuant to the Parent Rights Agreement or any other right issued in substitution thereof (a "
Parent Right
") shall be issued together with and shall
attach to each share of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Offer, unless the Rights shall have expired or been redeemed prior to the date that such shares are accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer. 

    
(c) 
As
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to
register the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "
Registration Statement
").
The Registration Statement will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "
Preliminary
prospectus
").
As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "
Schedule TO
") with respect to the Offer.
The Schedule TO shall contain
as an exhibit or incorporate by reference the Preliminary prospectus (or portions thereof) and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any.
Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they shall cause the Schedule TO, the Preliminary prospectus and all amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the "
Offer
Documents
") to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other Legal Requirements (as defined in Section 3.3).

Parent and Merger Sub further agree that the Offer Documents, on the date first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders, shall not 

A–3
