Background of the merger

   Since early 2000, NetIQ has pursued a strategy of further developing its
product lines through acquisitions of or investments in complementary products,
technologies and businesses.
In May 2000, NetIQ completed its strategic
combination with Mission Critical Software, Inc. and Ganymede Software, Inc.

   On November 14, 2000, representatives of Wit SoundView introduced Ching-Fa
Hwang, President and Chief Executive Officer of NetIQ, James Barth, Chief
Financial Officer of NetIQ, and Richard Pleczko, Vice President, Marketing, of
NetIQ, to Elijahu Shapira, co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
WebTrends and W. Glen Boyd, co-founder, President and Chief Technical Officer
of WebTrends, who were attending a conference in Boca Raton, Florida.
At the
meeting, the parties discussed the possibility of a meeting of their management
teams to explore potential joint business development opportunities.

   
On November 27, 2000, Mr. Hwang and Tom Kemp, NetIQ's Senior Vice President,
Products, met with Messrs. Shapira and Boyd in Portland, Oregon.
During the
meeting, the parties discussed the respective businesses, products, markets,
sales channels and financial results of the two companies.
At the conclusion of
the meeting, the parties determined that more extensive discussions between the
management teams of the two companies should be organized.

   
On December 5, 2000, WebTrends began working with Dain Rauscher Wessels with
respect to the potential transaction.
That engagement was formalized on January
8, 2001.

   
NetIQ had already retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as its advisor
in connection with the consideration of potential acquisitions.
On December 15,
2000, NetIQ management also engaged Wit SoundView to act as a financial adviser
in connection with a possible transaction with WebTrends.

   
On the afternoon of December 11, 2000, Messrs. Hwang and Barth went to
Portland for further discussions and dinner with Messrs. Shapira, Boyd and Jim
Richardson, WebTrends' Chief Financial Officer.
The discussions focussed on
each party's management styles, potential roles for WebTrends' senior
management in NetIQ after the proposed merger, the cultures of the two
companies and management's outlook on the future of their respective
businesses.

   
On December 13, 2000, Mr. Hwang and members of NetIQ senior management met
with Mr. Shapira and members of WebTrends senior management in San Jose,
California to discuss the proposed acquisition of WebTrends by NetIQ.
At the
meeting, the companies entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement.
Mr.
Hwang, Mr. Shapira and members of their teams each provided overviews of their
respective company's products and product strategy, and discussed the business
opportunities and challenges faced by their respective companies, the
complementary nature of their respective businesses and their personal
philosophies and management styles.
They also discussed conceptually the idea
of a combination of the two companies.
In these discussions Mr. Hwang stressed
to Mr. Shapira the importance to NetIQ of Mr. Shapira and Mr. Boyd joining the
NetIQ management team in the event of a merger (including Mr. Shapira joining
the NetIQ board of directors) and agreeing to restrictions on their
dispositions of NetIQ common stock after the merger.

   
On December 14, 2000, the NetIQ board of directors met with representatives
of Credit Suisse First Boston and Davis Polk & Wardwell to discuss a potential
acquisition of WebTrends.
The NetIQ board authorized management to continue its
discussions with WebTrends' management and, should these discussions progress,
to begin financial and legal due diligence.

   
On December 20, 2000, Messrs. Hwang and Barth of NetIQ met in Portland,
Oregon with Messrs. Shapira, Boyd and Richardson.
The discussion focused on
limitations that would be placed on dispositions of NetIQ common stock by
Messrs. Shapira and Boyd after the merger and financial results of NetIQ and
WebTrends.
The parties also discussed possible timing and next steps for
discussions between the two companies.

   
Over the holiday period the companies continued to exchange information and
to prepare for potential merger negotiations.

   
On January 3, 2001, Davis Polk & Wardwell provided a draft merger agreement
to Perkins Coie for purposes of facilitating discussion of the possible
structure and terms of an acquisition of WebTrends by NetIQ.

   
From January 4 to January 15, 2001, discussions continued between executives
and legal and financial advisors of the two companies and legal advisors for
Mr. Shapira and Mr. Boyd, and each company's CEO kept his board of directors
apprised through informal communications.
These discussions included
consideration of the risks and issues surrounding an acquisition, the terms of
the acquisition, the roles of WebTrends' management and employees after the
acquisition, the restrictions that would apply to Mr. Shapira and Mr. Boyd in
transferring the shares received in the merger, the compatibility of the two
companies' technology, products and culture and each company's financial
condition and operating results.
Davis Polk & Wardwell and Perkins Coie
exchanged numerous drafts of the merger agreement and related agreements,
negotiated the terms of these agreements and conducted legal due diligence
reviews.

   
On January 4 and 5, 2001, Mr. Barth led a team of NetIQ management, along
with representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston, Wit SoundView and Davis
Polk & Wardwell, in meetings with Mr. Richardson, WebTrends management and
representatives of Dain Rauscher Wessels in Portland, Oregon at the offices of
Perkins Coie and at WebTrends' headquarters.
WebTrends management made a series
of presentations on the products, technology, sales and distribution strategy
and financial results of WebTrends and responded to questions from NetIQ
management and its financial advisers.
NetIQ's in-house counsel and Davis Polk
& Wardwell conducted legal due diligence.

   
In discussions in early January, the parties tentatively agreed that based
on then current market prices an exchange ratio of approximately 0.48 NetIQ
shares for each WebTrends share would be acceptable to both sides.
The parties
agreed to continue with due diligence investigations and with negotiation of
other terms of the merger agreement and to revisit the exchange ratio when
these matters had progressed further.

   
On the morning of January 8, 2001, Mr. Hwang led a team including NetIQ's
senior management and one NetIQ director in meetings with Messrs. Shapira, Boyd
and WebTrends' senior management in Portland, Oregon.
The parties continued to
discuss business due diligence issues and integration issues, including
possible roles for WebTrends' senior management in NetIQ after the proposed
acquisition.

   
On January 8, 2001, the WebTrends board of directors held a special meeting
in Portland, Oregon and discussed a possible business combination with NetIQ.

board of directors at a meeting in Houston, Texas the proposed acquisition of
WebTrends by NetIQ.

WebTrends, the strategic rationale for the merger, the roles of WebTrends'
management and employees after the acquisition and the approximate exchange

overview of financial considerations relating to the acquisition, and a
representative of Davis Polk & Wardwell reviewed with the board its legal
responsibilities and the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement
and related agreements.

further discussions and due diligence to determine the merits and possible
terms of a merger agreement.

   
On January 10 and 11, 2001, Mr. Richardson led a team of WebTrends
management, along with representatives of Dain Rauscher Wessels, in meetings
with Mr. Hwang, NetIQ management and representatives of Credit Suisse First
Boston and Wit SoundView at the Menlo Park, California offices of Davis Polk &

NetIQ management made a
series of presentations on the products, technology, sales and distribution
strategy and financial results of NetIQ and responded to questions from

duties and presented a legal diligence report on NetIQ.
Members of WebTrends
management outlined the strategic reasons for a merger, integration plans, the
proposed management team of the combined entity and the results of business
diligence.
Representatives of Dain Rauscher Wessels offered a preliminary
financial analysis with respect to the proposed exchange ratio in the merger.

The board discussed the reports of Perkins Coie, Dain Rauscher Wessels and
management.
Board members considered at length the proposed combination in
light of the presentations made and other factors.
The board expressed its
approval of the continued negotiations and proposed transaction, subject to the
satisfactory completion of due diligence and the finalization of the merger
agreement.

   
On January 13 and 14, 2001 the companies finalized the principal terms of
the merger, completed their due diligence and continued preparation of
definitive agreements.
They also agreed that the 0.48 exchange ratio previously
discussed continued to be acceptable to both sides.

   
On January 15, 2001, the NetIQ board of directors met with senior management

and the close of the stock market, the merger agreement and related agreements
were executed.
The two companies issued a joint press release announcing the
acquisition prior to the opening of the stock market on January 17, 2001.

Reasons for the merger

   In their decisions to recommend and approve the merger, the boards of
directors of both NetIQ and WebTrends believe that the following reasons are
among the most important:

  .
the merger will allow the combined company to provide a more
    comprehensive suite of products and services to customers than either
    company could provide alone, encompassing systems administration,
    operations management, network performance management, security
    management, web management and eBusiness analytics and intelligence;

  .
the products of the two companies, while complementary, are not
    overlapping, which should avoid customer confusion and provide
    opportunities for cross-selling;

  .
the combined company will have significantly greater scale, with
    approximately 1,000 employees and pro forma combined revenues for the
    twelve months ended June 30, 2000, of approximately $133.0 million,
    giving it greater resources to enhance market presence, pursue research
    and development opportunities and provide coverage to customers;

  .
in addition to complementary products, each company has certain
    particular strengths that the combined company should benefit from,
    including in the case of NetIQ its direct sales organization and in the
    case of WebTrends its telemarketing and eBusiness fulfillment
    capabilities;

  .
the combination of the operations of the two companies should also result
    in efficiencies arising from shared business functions, information and
    other systems, and proprietary technologies;

  .
the combined company should be more attractive not only to customers but
    also to important partners such as Microsoft;

  .
for NetIQ, the merger enhances and accelerates its ability to serve
    customers with heterogeneous operating environments that go beyond
    NetIQ's traditional focus on the Windows platform;

  .
for WebTrends, integration with NetIQ enhances its ability to sell higher
    value products as part of its evolution beyond web analytics to business
    intelligence; and

  .
NetIQ and WebTrends share a number of important long-term corporate
    values, including a commitment to market leadership through innovative
    products and a desire to continuously deliver more value to customers.
    
Both companies also benefit from talented and dedicated employees with a
    long-standing commitment to excellence.
The boards believe that these
    shared values will facilitate a relatively smooth integration of the two
    companies.

   
Factors Considered.
Each board of directors consulted with its respective
management and outside legal and financial advisors as part of the process of
approving the merger.
The boards considered the following factors among others:

  .
historical information concerning the business, financial performance and
    condition, market opportunity and position, technology and management of
    the two companies;

  .
the respective managements' views of the benefits of the merger and of
    the impact of the merger on the combined business and operations of the
    two companies;

  .
estimates of future financial results of the two companies illustrating
    the potential financial results of the combined company;

  .
current and historical information concerning the trading prices and
    volatility of the two companies' shares;

  .
the consideration to be delivered by NetIQ and received by WebTrends
    shareholders compared to that in other transactions deemed comparable;

  .
for WebTrends, the opinion of Dain Rauscher Wessels to the effect that,
    as of the date of the opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger is fair
    from a financial point of view to the holders of WebTrends common stock;

  .
for NetIQ, the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston to the effect that,
    as of the date of the opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger is fair
    from a financial point of view to NetIQ;

  .
the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and the related voting
    agreements are reasonable;

  .
the impact of the merger upon customers and employees of the respective
    companies; and

  .
reports from the respective companies' managements, financial and legal
    advisors as to the results of their due diligence investigation of the
    other company.

   
Potential risks or other negative factors identified by the boards of
directors include the following:

  .
the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

  .
the challenges of integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures
    and organizations of the two companies, especially in light of NetIQ
    having completed two other sizable acquisition transactions within the
    past twelve months;

  .
the challenges of adding another substantial geographic center in
    Portland to NetIQ's established centers in San Jose and Houston;

  .
the risk of disruption of sales momentum as a result of uncertainties
    created by the announcement of the merger;

  .
the risk of loss of key talent;

  .
the risk that the merger might not be consummated despite the parties'
    efforts, even if approved by stockholders;

  .
the significant goodwill and other intangibles that would be added to the
    balance sheet of the combined company as a result of the impact of
    purchase accounting, and the current uncertainty as to whether and under
    what circumstances such goodwill might have to be amortized or otherwise
    deemed impaired and charged to income; and

  .
other applicable risks described in this joint prospectus/proxy statement
    in the section entitled "Risk Factors.
"

   Each board concluded that on balance the potential benefits of the merger
outweighed the potential risks.
This discussion of the information and factors
considered by the boards is not meant to be exhaustive.
Given the complexity of
the issue and the number of factors considered, neither board attempted to
quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to specific factors.


Recommendation of WebTrends' board of directors

   After careful consideration, WebTrends' board of directors unanimously
determined that the merger is in the best interests of the WebTrends
shareholders, unanimously approved the merger agreement and recommends that
WebTrends shareholders vote for approval and adoption of the merger agreement
and the merger.

description of the financial analysis.

   
Implied Consideration.
Giving effect to the exchange ratio, resulting
implied value of NetIQ consideration of $36.81 per share of WebTrends common
stock (based on the closing trading price for NetIQ common stock on January 12,
2001 of $76.69) and the outstanding WebTrends common stock on a fully diluted
basis, Dain Rauscher Wessels calculated the aggregate implied enterprise value
of WebTrends to be approximately $971 million.
Enterprise value is defined as
market capitalization, or equity value, plus debt less cash and cash
equivalents.

   
Comparable Company Analysis.
Dain Rauscher Wessels prepared a comparable
company analysis to analyze WebTrends' implied valuation relative to a group of
publicly traded companies that Dain Rauscher Wessels deemed for purposes of its
analysis to be comparable to WebTrends.
In this analysis, Dain Rauscher Wessels
compared the enterprise value of WebTrends implied by the exchange ratio (based
on the trading price of NetIQ's common stock at closing on January 12, 2001),
expressed as a multiple of actual and projected revenue in calendar years 2000
and 2001, to the range, mean and median multiples of enterprise values of
comparable companies implied by the public trading price of their common stock,
expressed as a multiple of the same operating data.
In addition, Dain Rauscher
Wessels compared the market capitalization or equity value of WebTrends implied
by the exchange ratio (based on the trading price of NetIQ's common stock at
closing on January 12, 2001), expressed as a multiple of price to earnings in
calendar years 2000 and 2001, to the range, mean and median price to earnings
multiples of comparable companies implied by the public trading

price of their common stock.
Multiples of future revenue and earnings for
WebTrends were based on projected revenue and earnings as estimated by Dain
Rauscher Wessels institutional research and, for the comparable companies, on
publicly available estimates.

   
Dain Rauscher Wessels compared enterprise value to revenue multiples and
price to earnings multiples of WebTrends' implied valuation with those of the
following publicly traded companies: Accrue Software, Inc.; Broadbase Software,
Inc.; E.piphany, Inc.; Informatica Corporation; Macromedia, Inc.; and
net.
Genesis Corporation.

   
The following table presents, as of January 12, 2001, and based on the 0.48
exchange ratio, WebTrends' implied enterprise value to revenue and price to
earnings multiples and the range, mean and median enterprise value to revenue
and price to earnings multiples for the aforementioned comparable companies for
calendar years 2000 and 2001:

   Dain Rauscher Wessels also presented selected stock market price and volume
data and illustrated the relative stock performance of WebTrends against the
comparable companies described above, the Nasdaq Composite Index and NetIQ.

   
Precedent Transaction Analysis.
Dain Rauscher Wessels compared transaction
value to revenue multiples relating to the proposed acquisition of WebTrends by
NetIQ with transaction value to revenue multiples in selected precedent merger
and acquisition transactions involving companies in the software industry.

Transaction value, with respect to NetIQ's acquisition of WebTrends, is the
enterprise value as of January 12, 2001, and, with respect to precedent
transactions, is the enterprise value on the date of announcement of the
transaction.
In selecting precedent transactions, Dain Rauscher Wessels
considered publicly traded software companies that announced transactions after
January 1, 2000, in which the transaction values at announcement were between
$250 million and $5 billion and last twelve month revenues were greater than
$10 million.

analyzed:

  .
the acquisition of Bluestone Software, Inc. by Hewlett-Packard Co.,
    announced on October 24, 2000;

For the purpose of calculating multiples, revenue was derived from both the
twelve month actual or estimated revenue of the target companies in the last
twelve months prior to the announcement of the transaction, or LTM revenue, as
well as twelve month estimated revenue of the target companies in the twelve
months following the announcement of the transaction, or FTM revenue.
Financial
data regarding the precedent transactions was taken from SEC filings, press
releases, Dain Rauscher Wessels institutional research and other Wall Street
estimates.
Dain Rauscher Wessels noted that public company valuations in the
software market have changed materially since the first quarter of the year.
As
such, Dain Rauscher Wessels analyzed the precedent transactions both in terms
of the implied transaction value at announcement and an adjusted transaction
value as of January 12, 2001, which takes into account the changes in stock
prices of the acquirers since announcement.

   
The following table compares the implied transaction multiple for the
transaction with the low, high, mean and median multiples for the selected
precedent transactions, as well as an adjusted transaction value, as of January
12, 2001, which takes into account the changes in stock prices of the acquirers
since announcement:

   Premiums Paid Analysis.
Dain Rauscher Wessels compared the implied premium
payable to holders of WebTrends common stock based on the exchange ratio to the
announced premiums in 169 stock-for-stock transactions announced since January
1, 1998, with transaction values greater than $100 million and which involved
public companies merging with or acquiring other public companies.
In this
analysis, Dain Rauscher Wessels assumed an announcement date of January 16,
2001.
Dain Rauscher Wessels compared WebTrends common stock price at
announcement implied by the exchange ratio to the WebTrends' price one day, one
week and one month prior to announcement to the price premiums for the same
periods for the targets in the selected transactions.
Dain Rauscher Wessels
observed that the one day, one week and one month premiums implied by the
exchange ratio to WebTrends on a historic basis were 40%, 53% and 30%,
respectively, and on a moving average basis for the same periods were 40%, 42%
and 35%, respectively.

   Relative Contribution Analysis.
Dain Rauscher Wessels analyzed the relative
contribution of each of WebTrends and NetIQ in calendar year 2001 in terms of
various financial statement categories relative to the pro forma combined
financial statements of the two stand-alone companies.
The financial statement
categories included revenue, operating income and net income.
Dain Rauscher
Wessels compared the relative contributions to the pro forma ownership
percentage of WebTrends and NetIQ security holders in the pro forma post-merger
combined company based on the fully-diluted equity ownership of the combined
entity, calculated using the treasury stock method of accounting on an
enterprise and equity value basis, assuming no synergies.
Dain Rauscher Wessels
observed that, based upon the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement,
the relative ownership of the combined company by WebTrends and NetIQ security
holders, on a fully diluted

equity value basis, would be 24.4% and 75.6%, respectively, at the close of the
merger.
Dain Rauscher Wessels also noted that the implied WebTrends and NetIQ
pro forma ownership, on an enterprise value basis, would be 24.7% and 75.3%,
respectively.
The following is a summary of this analysis for calendar 2001:

                                                                    Projected

Accretion/Dilution Analysis.
Dain Rauscher Wessels analyzed the pro forma
impact of the transaction on the projected earnings per share of the combined
company for fiscal 2001 using published research analyst estimates for
WebTrends and NetIQ.
Dain Rauscher Wessels estimated that the impact of the
transaction on the combined company's earnings per share would be accretive by
$0.02 in calendar 2001, excluding the impact of goodwill amortization and one-
time transaction related costs and assuming no synergies.

   
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves the
application of subjective business judgment in determining the most appropriate
and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods
to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible
to partial consideration of the analyses or summary description.
Dain Rauscher
Wessels believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of the analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete or misleading
view of the processes underlying its opinion.
In arriving at its fairness
determination, Dain Rauscher Wessels considered the results of all of its
analyses as well as qualitative factors, including the enhanced competitive
position of the combined company that is expected to result from offering a
broader suite of products, a stronger combined management team, and the greater
size and critical mass of the combined company.
In view of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the fairness of the
merger consideration from a financial point of view, Dain Rauscher Wessels did
not find it practicable to assign relative weights to the factors considered in
reaching its opinion.

   
No single company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison
is identical to WebTrends or NetIQ or the proposed merger.
The analyses were
prepared solely for purposes of Dain Rauscher Wessels providing an opinion as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock
of WebTrends of the exchange ratio and do not purport to be appraisals or
necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty.

   
In connection with its analyses, Dain Rauscher Wessels made, and was
provided by WebTrends' management, numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond WebTrends' or NetIQ's control.
Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses.
Because such analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of
WebTrends, NetIQ or their advisors, none of WebTrends, NetIQ, Dain Rauscher
Wessels or any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual
values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.

   
Dain Rauscher Wessels is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and
is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Dain
Rauscher Wessels regularly publishes research reports regarding the software
industry and the businesses and securities of publicly owned companies in that
industry.
In the ordinary course of business, Dain Rauscher Wessels and its
affiliates may act as a market maker and broker in the publicly traded
securities of WebTrends and NetIQ and may receive customary compensation in
connection with those activities.
Dain Rauscher Wessels and its affiliates may
also actively trade securities of

WebTrends and NetIQ for their own accounts or the accounts of their customers
and, accordingly, may from time to time hold a long or short position in those
securities.
WebTrends selected Dain Rauscher Wessels to render its opinion
based on Dain Rauscher Wessels' knowledge of the software industry and its
experience in mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuation generally.

   
Pursuant to an engagement letter, WebTrends paid Dain Rauscher Wessels a
customary fee upon the rendering of its opinion.
Payment of this fee to Dain
Rauscher Wessels was not contingent upon the closing of the merger.
WebTrends
has also agreed to pay Dain Rauscher Wessels a customary transaction fee upon
the closing of the merger for investment banking and financial advisory
services.
The transaction fee is contingent upon the closing of the merger.

Whether or not the transaction closes, WebTrends has agreed to reimburse Dain
Rauscher Wessels for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify
Dain Rauscher Wessels against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of
services performed by Dain Rauscher Wessels in connection with merger.
The
terms of the engagement letter, which WebTrends believes are customary for
transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arms'-length between WebTrends
and Dain Rauscher Wessels, and WebTrends' board of directors was aware of this
fee arrangement at the time of its approval of the merger agreement.


Recommendation of NetIQ's board of directors

   After careful consideration, the NetIQ board of directors has determined the
merger agreement and the merger to be fair to and in the best interests of
NetIQ and its stockholders.
In connection with the merger, NetIQ's board of
directors unanimously recommends approval of the issuance of shares of NetIQ
common stock in the merger as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.


Opinion of NetIQ's financial advisor

   NetIQ retained Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation to act as its
principal financial advisor in connection with the merger.
In connection with
Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, NetIQ requested that Credit Suisse
First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to NetIQ of
the exchange ratio provided for in the merger.
On January 15, 2001, the NetIQ
board of directors met to review the proposed merger and the final terms of the
merger agreement.
During this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to
the NetIQ board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing on January 16, 2001, that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon
and subject to the various considerations set forth in the Credit Suisse First
Boston opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
NetIQ.

   
The full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, which sets forth,
among other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Credit Suisse First
Boston in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
NetIQ
stockholders are urged to, and should, read the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion carefully and in its entirety.
The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion
addresses only the fairness of the exchange ratio to NetIQ from a financial
point of view as of the date of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed merger.

The summary of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.

   
In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston, among other
things,

  . reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents;

  .
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
    relating to NetIQ and WebTrends;

  .
reviewed certain other information relating to NetIQ and WebTrends,
    including financial forecasts discussed with it by NetIQ and WebTrends,
    and met with the managements of NetIQ and WebTrends to discuss the
    businesses and prospects of NetIQ and WebTrends, including the ability to
    integrate the businesses of NetIQ and WebTrends;

  .
considered certain financial and stock market data of NetIQ and WebTrends
    and compared that data with similar data for other publicly held
    companies in businesses similar to NetIQ and WebTrends;

  .
considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
    certain other business combinations and other transactions which have
    recently been effected or announced; and

  .
considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
    investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which Credit
    Suisse First Boston deemed relevant.

   
In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume any
responsibility for independent verification of any of the foregoing information
and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all material
respects.
With respect to financial forecasts that it reviewed, the managements
of NetIQ and WebTrends reviewed publicly available financial forecasts for
NetIQ and WebTrends, respectively, and advised Credit Suisse First Boston, and
Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, that such publicly available forecasts
represent reasonable estimates and judgments as to the future financial
performance of NetIQ and WebTrends, respectively.
In addition, Credit Suisse
First Boston relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of
the managements of NetIQ and WebTrends as to WebTrends' existing technology and
products, the validity of, and risks associated with, WebTrends' future
technology and products, and the ability to integrate the businesses of NetIQ
and WebTrends.
NetIQ also informed Credit Suisse First Boston, and Credit
Suisse First Boston assumed, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
Credit Suisse First Boston was
not requested to make, and did not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal
of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of NetIQ or WebTrends,
nor was Credit Suisse First Boston furnished with any such evaluations or
appraisals.
The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion is necessarily based upon
information available to it, and financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated, on the date of the Credit
Suisse First Boston opinion.
Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any
opinion as to what the value of the NetIQ common stock actually will be when
issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which shares of NetIQ common
stock will trade at any time.

   
In preparing its opinion to NetIQ, Credit Suisse First Boston performed a
variety of financial and comparative analyses.
The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description.
Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses
and factors, could create a misleading view of the processes underlying the
Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.
No company or transaction used in the
analysis performed by Credit Suisse First Boston as a comparison is identical
to NetIQ, WebTrends or the contemplated merger.
In addition, Credit Suisse
First Boston may have given various analyses more or less weight than other
analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions, so that the range of valuation resulting from any particular
analysis described below should not be taken to be Credit Suisse First Boston's
view of the actual value of NetIQ or WebTrends.
In performing its analyses,
Credit Suisse First Boston made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of NetIQ or WebTrends.
The analyses performed
by Credit Suisse First Boston are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold.
The analyses
performed were prepared solely as part of Credit Suisse First Boston's analysis
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to NetIQ
and were provided to the board of directors of NetIQ in connection with the
delivery of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion.

   
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the preparation of its opinion,
and reviewed with the NetIQ board of directors at a meeting of the NetIQ board
of directors held on January 15, 2001.
Certain of the summaries of those
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.
In order to
understand fully the material financial analyses

used by Credit Suisse First Boston, the tables should be read together with the
text of each summary.
The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the material financial analyses.

   Transaction Multiples.
Credit Suisse First Boston calculated several values
implied by the exchange ratio, including the implied price per WebTrends share,
the fully diluted equity value and aggregate value of WebTrends and the pro
forma fully diluted ownership of NetIQ by WebTrends shareholders, as well as
the multiples of the implied aggregate transaction value and equity value to
WebTrends' projected revenues and earnings for 2000 and 2001.

  .
Acquisition of Andromedia by Macromedia

  .
Acquisition of Blaze Software by Brokat Infosystems

  .
Acquisition of OnDisplay by Vignette

  .
Acquisition of Sterling Software by Computer Associates

No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent software transaction
analyses is identical to the merger.
In evaluating the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of WebTrends and NetIQ,
such as the impact of competition on the businesses of WebTrends and NetIQ and
the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of WebTrends and NetIQ or the
industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the average or the median, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using comparable transaction data.

   
Contribution Analysis.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the relative
contributions of WebTrends and NetIQ to the pro forma total revenues, gross
profit, operating income and net income of the combined company, based on
estimates for calendar years 2000 and 2001 prepared by securities research
analysts regarding WebTrends and NetIQ.
Credit Suisse First Boston derived the
WebTrends pro forma ownership of the combined company, the exchange ratio, the
WebTrends value per share and the premium to WebTrends' recent closing price
implied by such relative contributions.
The following table summarizes the
results of this analysis setting forth the range of results for the calendar
years 2000 and 2001:

   Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion and presentation to the NetIQ board of
directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the NetIQ board
of directors in making its determination to recommend the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby.
Consequently, the analyses described
above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the NetIQ board
of directors or the management of NetIQ with respect to the value of WebTrends
or whether the NetIQ board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different exchange ratio.

   
The NetIQ board of directors retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as
its principal financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Credit Suisse
First Boston was selected by the NetIQ board of directors based on Credit
Suisse First Boston's qualifications, expertise and reputation.
Credit Suisse
First Boston has in the past provided financial and investment banking services
to NetIQ for which Credit Suisse First Boston received compensation.
Credit
Suisse First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm.
Credit Suisse First Boston, as part of its investment banking
business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.
In the ordinary course of its business, Credit

Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively trade the securities of
NetIQ and WebTrends for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities.

   
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated November 15, 2000, NetIQ engaged
Credit Suisse First Boston to provide financial advisory services to the NetIQ
board of directors in connection with the merger, including, among other
things, rendering its opinion and making the presentation referred to above.

Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter, NetIQ has agreed to pay Credit
Suisse First Boston a customary fee in connection therewith, a significant
portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger, and the NetIQ
Board of directors was aware of this fee arrangement at the time of its
approval of the merger agreement.
Credit Suisse First Boston will also receive
a fee for rendering its opinion.
In addition, NetIQ has agreed to reimburse
Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify Credit Suisse
First Boston and certain related persons against certain liabilities and
expenses arising out of or in conjunction with its rendering of services under
its engagement, including liabilities arising under the federal securities
laws.


Interests of certain persons in the merger

   In considering the recommendations of WebTrends' board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, WebTrends shareholders should be aware that
certain directors and members of management of WebTrends have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, their interests as WebTrends
shareholders generally.
The names and titles of the individuals who are
directors or executive officers of WebTrends and who are known to have these
additional interests are listed below.
WebTrends' board of directors was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
merger.

  
NetIQ Board of Directors After the Merger

   NetIQ has agreed to take action to have Elijahu Shapira, currently the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WebTrends, elected to the NetIQ board.

See "The Merger Agreement--NetIQ Board and Management.

   Certain directors and executive officers of WebTrends have agreements with
WebTrends that provide for the acceleration of a portion of their unvested

The following table summarizes such
provisions with respect to each outstanding option for each such director or
executive officer:

                                                                                     Percentage of

In addition, the portion of such options that remain unvested after the
merger will become vested in the event that the option holder's employment with
or service to the combined company should be terminated within two years after
the merger other than by voluntary termination by the option holder.
In
addition to the persons named above, certain employees of Webtrends who are not
directors or executive officers will receive partial acceleration of their
options as a result of the merger.

  
Other Employee Benefits

   Elijahu Shapira, the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
WebTrends, and W. Glen Boyd, the current President and Chief Technical Officer
of WebTrends, entered into employment agreements with NetIQ dated January 16,
2001, that provide for the terms of their employment with NetIQ following the
merger.
The agreements provide that Mr. Shapira shall serve as Chief Strategy
Officer of NetIQ and that Mr. Boyd shall serve as Chief Information Officer of
NetIQ.
Set forth below is a description of the material terms of these
agreements.

   
Compensation.
Both employment agreements provide for the following
compensation arrangements:

eligibility for an annual bonus, the target amount of which must be at
    least $100,000, in accordance with NetIQ's usual bonus arrangements for
    similarly situated executives; and

    immediately prior to the merger under the terms of WebTrends' stock
    option plan, which grant shall be assumed by NetIQ upon consummation of

Based on the exchange ratio in the merger, each option will
    become an option to purchase approximately 150,000 shares of NetIQ common
    stock.
The option grants are subject to a vesting schedule as follows:
    25% of the shares subject to option will vest on the first anniversary of
    the merger, an additional 25% will vest on the second anniversary of the
    merger and the remaining 50% will vest on the third anniversary, assuming
    in each case the executive's continued employment with NetIQ.

   
Other Benefits.
Both executives will, at the effective time, enter into
NetIQ's standard director and officer indemnification agreement and change of
control severance agreement that NetIQ has entered into with similarly situated
executives.
Under NetIQ's standard executive officer change of control
severance agreement, an executive who is terminated involuntarily within the
12-month period following a change of control is entitled to up to six months
of continuing base salary payments as well as full acceleration of all options
granted to such executive.

   
Under these change of control severance agreements, involuntary termination
is defined to include (1) a significant reduction of the executive's duties,
position or responsibilities, (2) substantial reduction of the facilities and
perquisites available to the executive, (3) reduction of base salary, (4)
material reduction in benefits, (5) relocation to a facility more than 50 miles
from executive's then current location, (6) termination by NetIQ without cause
and (7) failure of NetIQ to obtain assumption of the change in control
severance agreement by any successor to NetIQ.
Cause is defined under these
agreements to include (1) any action of personal dishonesty by the executive in
connection with his responsibilities intended to result in substantial personal
enrichment of the executive, (2) conviction of a felony that would have a
material detrimental effect on NetIQ, (3) a willful act of misconduct that is
injurious to NetIQ, and (4) continued willful violations of executive's duties
after notice from NetIQ of executive's failure to perform his duties.

   
Limitations on Dispositions.
Each executive will be subject to NetIQ's
insider trading policies for the duration of his status as an affiliate of
NetIQ.
Subject to the blackout periods imposed by NetIQ's insider trading
policies during which NetIQ's directors, officers and certain other insiders
may not trade in NetIQ's securities, each executive will be permitted to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of up to 250,000 shares of NetIQ common stock per
quarter during the first year after the merger.
This quarterly allowance may be
increased to up to 500,000 shares if NetIQ has imposed in a previous quarter
special blackout periods exceeding the number of days specified under the
employment agreement and to the extent that during such quarter, the executive
did not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the full quarterly allowance of
250,000 shares.
Each executive will be permitted to establish a written
agreement for the distribution of their shares of NetIQ common stock pursuant
to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The plan will specify
that, to the extent practicable, sales will be made in the first fifteen days
after the opening of the regular quarterly trading window following NetIQ's
quarterly earnings release.
If an executive enters into such an agreement,
NetIQ has agreed not to impose a blackout period on the executive during such
fifteen-day period.

   
If the employment of either executive is terminated by NetIQ for cause or by
the executive without good reason during the first year of such executive's
employment, such executive shall no longer be able to sell his quarterly
allowance of shares until after the first anniversary of the merger or for such
longer period not to exceed three months, determined pursuant to a formula
provided in the employment agreement.

   
Under the employment agreements, cause is defined to include (1) executive's
willful failure to perform his duties as an executive, (2) material dishonesty
in the performance of executive's duties, (3), executive's conviction of a
felony, (4) willful breach of the employment agreement and other agreements, as
well as willful breach of fiduciary duty, and (5) any other willful act or
omission that is materially injurious to the financial condition or business
reputation of NetIQ.

   
Under the employment agreements, good reason is defined to include (1)
reduction in executive's annual base salary or benefits that are not generally
applicable to similarly situated executives, (2) a material adverse change in
executive's status, title, position or material responsibilities or (3)
relocation, without executive's consent, of executive to a location more than
50 miles away from WebTrends' facilities in Portland, Oregon.

   
Non-competition and Non-solicitation.
Each executive has agreed not to work
for, make a significant investment in or otherwise participate in the affairs
of any company that competes with NetIQ's business as it exists immediately
after the merger for a period beginning at the completion of the merger and
ending on the second anniversary of the merger.
For the same period, each
executive has agreed (1) not to solicit or otherwise divert NetIQ's customers,
suppliers or other business partners and (2) not to solicit or recruit
employees of NetIQ.

  
Indemnification and Insurance

   Under the merger agreement, NetIQ has agreed to:

  .
indemnify and hold harmless present or former directors or officers of
    WebTrends or its subsidiaries for a period of six years for all acts or
    omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, including
    the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to the same extent
    these persons are indemnified and held harmless in WebTrends' articles of
    incorporation or bylaws or under Oregon law as of the date of the merger
    agreement, and

  .
provide an insurance and indemnification policy that grants WebTrends'
    officers and directors in office immediately prior to the effective time
    of the merger coverage no less favorable than WebTrends' policy in effect
    as of the date of the merger agreement, provided, however, that in
    satisfying such obligation NetIQ shall not be obligated to pay annual
    premiums in excess of $1.0 million.
NetIQ has agreed to make arrangements
    for the assumption of these obligations in the event of a subsequent
    merger or sale of NetIQ or WebTrends.

   
See "The Merger Agreement--Principal Covenants--Benefits Continuation" for a
description of the benefits provided by the merger agreement for employees of
WebTrends generally.


Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates

   The shares of NetIQ common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act.
These shares will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of NetIQ common stock issued to any
person who is an affiliate of WebTrends or NetIQ.
Persons who may be deemed to
be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control of WebTrends or NetIQ and may include some of their
respective officers and directors, as well as their respective principal
stockholders.
Affiliates may not sell their shares of NetIQ common stock
acquired in the merger except pursuant to (1) an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, (2) an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (3) any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.


Completion and effectiveness of the merger

   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger by the shareholders of WebTrends and approval of the
issuance of NetIQ common stock in the merger by stockholders of NetIQ.
The
merger will become effective upon the filing of the articles of merger with the
State of Oregon.


Structure of the merger and conversion of WebTrends common stock

   Pursuant to the merger agreement, North Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of NetIQ, will merge with and into WebTrends.
WebTrends will
then be a wholly-owned subsidiary of NetIQ.

   
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of WebTrends common
stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.48 shares of NetIQ common
stock.
No fractional shares of NetIQ common stock will be issued pursuant to
the merger.
In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of NetIQ common
stock, WebTrends shareholders will receive cash equal to the product of such
fractional share amount, after aggregating all fractional shares to which a
former holder of WebTrends common stock would be entitled, and the average
closing price of NetIQ common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
for the five trading days immediately preceding the effectiveness of the
merger.
Options to purchase shares of WebTrends common stock will be converted
into options to purchase shares of NetIQ common stock after completion of the
merger.
The number of shares covered by, and the exercise price for, each
option will be adjusted using the merger exchange ratio of 0.48 shares of NetIQ
for each share of WebTrends.


Material U.S. federal income tax consequences

   The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger.
This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and
court decisions as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive
effect.

   
This discussion only addresses shares of WebTrends common stock held as
capital assets.
It does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that
may be important to a WebTrends shareholder in light of that shareholder's
particular circumstances or to a WebTrends shareholder subject to special
rules, such as:

  .
a shareholder who is not a citizen or resident of the United States;

  .
a financial institution or insurance company;

  .
a tax-exempt organization;

  .
a dealer or broker in securities;

  .
a shareholder that holds WebTrends common stock as part of a hedge,
    appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction; or

  .
a shareholder who acquired WebTrends common stock pursuant to the
    exercise of options or otherwise as compensation.

   
Tax Opinions.
NetIQ has received an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, and
WebTrends has received an opinion of Perkins Coie LLP, each dated as of the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, that the merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that NetIQ, its merger
subsidiary and WebTrends will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
It is a condition to
the obligation of each of NetIQ and WebTrends to complete the merger that the
relevant tax counsel confirm its opinion as of the closing date.
Neither NetIQ
nor WebTrends intends to waive this condition.

   
The opinions of tax counsel regarding the merger have relied, and the
confirmation opinions regarding the merger as of the closing date will each
rely, on (1) representations and covenants made by NetIQ and WebTrends,
including those contained in certificates of officers of NetIQ and WebTrends,
and (2) specified assumptions, including an assumption regarding the completion
of the merger in the manner contemplated by the merger agreement.
In addition,
the opinions of tax counsel have assumed, and tax counsel's ability to provide
the closing date opinions will depend on, the absence of changes in existing
facts or in law between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the closing date.
If any of those representations, covenants or assumptions is
inaccurate, either or both tax counsel may not be able to provide the required
closing date opinions or the tax consequences of the merger could differ from
those described in the opinions that tax counsel have delivered.
Tax counsel's
opinions neither bind the Internal Revenue Service nor preclude the IRS or the
courts from adopting a contrary position.
Neither NetIQ nor WebTrends intends
to obtain a ruling from the IRS on the tax consequences of the merger.

   
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger.
The merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and NetIQ, its merger subsidiary
and WebTrends will each be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Neither NetIQ, its merger
subsidiary nor WebTrends will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the merger.

   
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to WebTrends Shareholders
Who
Participate in the Merger.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes:

  .
A holder of WebTrends common stock will not recognize any gain or loss
    upon its exchange of shares of WebTrends common stock for shares of NetIQ
    common stock;

  .
If a holder of WebTrends common stock receives cash instead of a
    fractional share of NetIQ common stock, the holder will be required to
    recognize gain or loss, measured by the difference between the amount of
    cash received instead of that fractional share and the portion of the tax
    basis of that holder's shares of WebTrends common stock allocable to that
    fractional share.
This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and
    will be long-term capital gain or loss if the share of WebTrends common
    stock exchanged for that fractional share of NetIQ common stock was held
    for more than one year at the effective time of the merger;

  .
A holder of WebTrends common stock will have a tax basis in the NetIQ
    common stock received in the merger equal to (1) the tax basis of the
    WebTrends common stock surrendered by that holder in the merger, less (2)
    any tax basis of the WebTrends common stock surrendered that is allocable
    to any fractional share of NetIQ common stock for which cash is received;
    and

  .
The holding period for shares of NetIQ common stock received in exchange
    for shares of WebTrends common stock in the merger will include the
    holding period for the shares of WebTrends common stock surrendered in
    the merger.

   
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to NetIQ Shareholders.
For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, holders of NetIQ common stock will not recognize gain or
loss as a result of the merger.

   
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a
complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger.
This discussion does not address tax consequences
that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances.
In
addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local
tax consequences of the merger.
Accordingly, we strongly urge the WebTrends
shareholders to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular U.S.
federal, state or local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the
merger to such shareholder.


Accounting treatment of the merger

   The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.
The purchase price will be allocated to assets and liabilities of
WebTrends and such assets and liabilities will be recorded at their respective
fair values upon completion of the merger.
A portion of the purchase price may
be identified as in-process research and development.
This amount, if any, will
be charged to NetIQ's operations in the quarter the merger is completed and the
acquisition accounting and valuation amounts are finalized.
Furthermore, a
portion of the purchase price equal to the intrinsic value of the unvested
options assumed in the merger will be allocated to deferred stock-based
compensation, which will be amortized over the remaining vesting period of
these options.
The remaining purchase price will be reflected as goodwill and
other intangible assets.
Currently, accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States require that all intangible assets, including goodwill, be
amortized over the useful lives of such assets.
However, if current FASB
proposals become effective, certain intangible assets, including goodwill, will
be maintained on the balance sheet rather than being amortized, although they
may eventually be written down to the extent that they are deemed to be
impaired.
The results of operations and cashflows of WebTrends will be included
in NetIQ's financial statements prospectively as of the consummation of the
merger.


Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger

   U.S. Antitrust.
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, or the HSR Act, and the related rules, the merger may not be completed
until NetIQ, WebTrends and certain shareholders of WebTrends notify and furnish
information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements
have been satisfied.
In connection with the merger, on January 26, 2001, NetIQ,
WebTrends and certain shareholders of WebTrends each filed with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division the required notification and report forms under the HSR
Act.
The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the merger was
terminated on February 7, 2001.

   
Notwithstanding termination of the HSR Act waiting period, at any time
before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division or
the FTC could take any action under U.S. antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion
of the merger or seeking the divestiture of substantial assets of NetIQ or
WebTrends.
Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring actions
under U.S. antitrust laws depending on the circumstances.
Although we believe
that the merger is legal under U.S. antitrust laws, we can give no assurance
that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if
this challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

   
Other Laws.
NetIQ and WebTrends conduct operations in a number of other
jurisdictions where regulatory filings, notifications or approvals with
applicable commissions and other authorities may be required or advisable in
connection with completion of the merger.
NetIQ and WebTrends are currently
reviewing whether other filings or approvals may be required or desirable in
these other jurisdictions.
We recognize that some of these filings may not be
completed before the closing, and that some of these approvals, which are not
required to be obtained prior to effectiveness of a merger, may also not be
obtained before the closing of the merger.

   
General.
It is possible that governmental entities having jurisdiction over
NetIQ and WebTrends may seek regulatory concessions as conditions for granting
approval of the merger.
A regulatory body's approval may contain terms or
impose conditions or restrictions relating or applying to, or requiring changes
in or limitations on, the operation or ownership of any asset or business of
NetIQ, WebTrends or any of their subsidiaries, or NetIQ's ownership of
WebTrends, or requiring asset divestitures, which conditional approval could
reasonably be expected to result in a substantial detriment to NetIQ, WebTrends
and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after the closing.
If such an
approval requires these kinds of restrictions, conditions, changes, limitations
or divestitures, either NetIQ or WebTrends can decline to close under the
merger agreement.
We

can give no assurance that the required regulatory approvals will be obtained
on terms that satisfy the conditions to closing of the merger or are within the
time frame contemplated by NetIQ and WebTrends.
See "The Merger Agreement--
Principal Conditions to Completion of the Merger.
"

No dissenters' rights

   WebTrends' shareholders will not have dissenters' rights of appraisal under
Oregon law with respect to the merger because WebTrends' common stock is traded
on the Nasdaq National Market.

   
NetIQ's stockholders will not have appraisal rights under Delaware law with
respect to the merger because:

  .
NetIQ's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market; and

  .
NetIQ stockholders will continue to hold their shares after the merger.


Listing on Nasdaq of NetIQ common stock to be issued in the merger

   NetIQ has agreed to cause the shares of common stock to be issued in the
merger to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market.


Delisting and deregistration of WebTrends common stock after the merger

   If the merger is completed, WebTrends' common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

                              
THE MERGER AGREEMENT

General

   The merger agreement contemplates the merger of North Acquisition
Corporation, a subsidiary of NetIQ, with and into WebTrends, with WebTrends
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NetIQ.
The merger will
become effective at the effective time in accordance with the articles of
merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon.
We
anticipate that we will make these filings as soon as practicable after the
last of the conditions precedent to the merger, as set forth in the merger
agreement, has been satisfied or waived.
The merger agreement obligates NetIQ
to have the shares of NetIQ common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market.
The following
description of the merger agreement may not contain all the information about
it that is important to you.
We thus encourage you to refer to the agreement
itself, which we attach as Annex A and incorporate by reference.


Merger Consideration

   At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
WebTrends common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.48 shares
of NetIQ common stock.
Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of
NetIQ common stock that would otherwise be issuable.


Exchange of Shares

   Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, NetIQ will
deposit with an exchange agent designated by NetIQ and reasonably acceptable to
WebTrends certificates representing the shares of NetIQ common stock issuable
upon conversion of the outstanding shares of WebTrends common stock and will
from time to time deposit cash in an amount required to be paid for fractional
shares of NetIQ common stock and dividends and other distributions on the
shares of NetIQ common stock.
As promptly as practicable after the effective
time of the merger, NetIQ will cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder
of WebTrends common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions.
Thereafter,
holders of shares of WebTrends common stock may surrender their certificates to
the exchange agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal.
In
exchange for the share certificates, holders will receive NetIQ common stock
certificates representing the number of shares as described under "--Merger
Consideration."
Holders of unexchanged shares of WebTrends common stock will
not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions payable by
NetIQ with respect to those shares of NetIQ common stock until the applicable
WebTrends certificate is surrendered.
Upon surrender and subject to applicable
laws, however, those holders will receive accumulated dividends and
distributions, without interest, together with cash in lieu of fractional
shares.

   
NetIQ will not issue fractional shares of common stock in the merger.
For
each fractional share that would otherwise be issued, the exchange agent will
pay the holder an amount equal to the fractional part of a share of NetIQ
common stock multiplied by the average closing NetIQ stock price on the five
trading days immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.


Stock Options

   At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase
WebTrends common stock, regardless of the extent vested and exercisable, shall
be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under the WebTrends stock option, the same number of shares
of NetIQ common stock as the holder of the WebTrends option would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement, had the holder exercised
the WebTrends option in full immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
The price per share shall
equal:

  .
the aggregate exercise price for the WebTrends common stock otherwise
    purchasable pursuant to the WebTrends option, divided by

  .
the aggregate number of full shares of NetIQ common stock deemed
    purchasable pursuant to the WebTrends option in accordance with the
    foregoing.

   
NetIQ has agreed to take all action necessary to implement the above,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of a sufficient number of
shares of NetIQ common stock for delivery upon exercise of these assumed
options.
NetIQ shall cause the NetIQ common stock issuable upon exercise of
these options to be covered by a registration statement and maintain its
effectiveness for so long as the options remain outstanding.


NetIQ Board and Management

   NetIQ has agreed to take the necessary corporate action so that, as of the
effective time of the merger:

  .
Elijahu Shapira, the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
    WebTrends, will become Chief Strategy Officer and a member of the board
    of directors of NetIQ.

  .
W. Glen Boyd, current President and Chief Technical Officer of WebTrends,
    will become Chief Information Officer of NetIQ.


Representations and Warranties

   The merger agreement contains a number of representations and warranties of
NetIQ and WebTrends as to, among other things, due incorporation and valid
existence, corporate authority and required shareholder approvals to enter into
the contemplated transactions, required consents and filings with government
entities, absence of conflicts with organizational documents and material
agreements, capitalization, ownership of subsidiaries, reports filed with the
SEC, financial statements, information supplied for use in this document,
material contracts, material changes or events, undisclosed liabilities,
compliance with laws, litigation, finder's fees, opinion of financial advisor,
tax matters, environmental matters and intellectual property.
Representations
and warranties made solely by WebTrends relate to particular employee benefits
and the inapplicability of state takeover statutes to the merger.

   
Many of these representations and warranties are qualified by the absence of
a material adverse effect, which, for purposes of the merger agreement, means
with respect to NetIQ or WebTrends, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or results
of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than
a decline in stock price.

   
The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive
the effective time of the merger.


Principal Covenants

   Interim Operations of NetIQ and WebTrends.
Each of NetIQ and WebTrends has
undertaken a separate covenant that places restrictions on it and its
subsidiaries until either the effective time or termination of the merger
agreement.
In general, NetIQ and its subsidiaries and WebTrends and its
subsidiaries are required to conduct their business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and to preserve intact their present business
organizations and relationships with third parties.

   
Each company has also agreed to some specific restrictions that are subject
to exceptions described in the merger agreement.
These restrictions include:

  .
amending its organizational documents;

  .
entering into certain significant transactions, such as a merger,
    consolidation or material acquisition or disposition; and

  .
taking any action that would make any representation and warranty
    inaccurate in any respect.

   
NetIQ and WebTrends have agreed to cooperate with each other and take
actions and do all things necessary or advisable under the merger agreement and
applicable laws to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

   
No Solicitation by WebTrends.
WebTrends has agreed that it and its
subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors will not take
action to solicit or encourage an offer for an alternative acquisition
transaction involving WebTrends of a nature defined in the merger agreement.

   
Restricted actions include engaging in any discussions or negotiations with
any potential bidder, disclosing any nonpublic information relating to
WebTrends or any of its subsidiaries or affording access to their properties,
books or records to any potential bidder, granting any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of WebTrends'
equity securities, or entering into any agreement with respect to any
acquisition proposal, other than in the manner contemplated below.

   
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restricted actions described in the
previous paragraph are permitted in response to an unsolicited bona fide offer
so long as, before doing so: (1) the WebTrends' board of directors determines
in good faith by a majority vote, after consulting with its financial advisor
and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the offer, that the
offer is a superior proposal, which is defined in the merger agreement to mean
any bona fide, unsolicited written acquisition proposal for over 51% of the
outstanding WebTrends common shares or a sale of WebTrends assets representing
over 51% of the value of the business on terms that are more favorable and
provide greater value to WebTrends' shareholders than the merger; (2) WebTrends
has otherwise complied with the "no solicitation" restrictions discussed above,
as well as with the notice requirement specified below; and (3) WebTrends'
board of directors determines in good faith by a majority vote after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it must take the action in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
In addition,
before providing non-public information, WebTrends must receive from the person
making the offer an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favorable to WebTrends that those in the existing confidentiality agreement
between NetIQ and WebTrends.
In addition, WebTrends may not enter into any
agreement with respect to any third party offer without first complying with
the further restrictions discussed below.

   
WebTrends must keep NetIQ informed of the identity of any potential bidder
and the terms and status of any offer.
WebTrends also agreed to terminate any
discussions or negotiations with any person pending before January 16, 2001.

   
WebTrends Board's Covenant to Recommend.
The WebTrends board of directors
has agreed to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger to WebTrends'
shareholders.
The board, however, can withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse
to NetIQ, its recommendation if: (1) WebTrends has otherwise complied with the
no solicitation restrictions discussed above under "--No Solicitation by
WebTrends;" (2) a superior proposal is pending at the time; (3) the board
determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that it must take the action to comply with its
fiduciary duties to its shareholders; and (4) it delivers prior written notice
to NetIQ that it intends to take this action.

   
NetIQ may terminate the merger agreement if WebTrends' board of directors
fails to make or withdraws its recommendation to WebTrends shareholders in
favor of the merger with NetIQ or if it fails to call the meeting of its
shareholders.
The circumstances in which the merger agreement may be terminated
are described more fully below under the heading "--Termination."

   Indemnification and Insurance.
These provisions of the merger agreement are
discussed above under the heading "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger--
Indemnification and Insurance.
"

   Benefits Continuation.
NetIQ has agreed that it will provide, for employees
of WebTrends and its subsidiaries, benefits under employee benefits plans that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those currently provided by
NetIQ to its similarly situated employees.
In addition, NetIQ has agreed to
certain employee benefit matters and arrangements including those described
under "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger--Other Employee Benefits.
"

   Certain Other Covenants.
The merger agreement contains additional mutual
covenants, including covenants relating to preparation and distribution of this
document, cooperation regarding filings with governmental and other agencies
and organizations and obtaining any governmental or third-party consents or
approvals, public announcements, further assurances, access to information,
mutual notification of particular events, confidential treatment of non-public
information and coordination of stockholders' meetings and actions to be taken
so as not to jeopardize the intended tax or accounting treatment of the merger.

in connection with the merger by the NetIQ stockholders or the WebTrends
shareholders, in any of the following ways:

   (a) by mutual written consent of NetIQ and WebTrends,

   (b) by either NetIQ or WebTrends if:

    .
the merger has not been completed by June 30, 2001, provided that
      neither NetIQ nor WebTrends can terminate the merger agreement under
      this clause if its breach of any obligation under the merger agreement
      has resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before that
      date;

    .
NetIQ stockholders or WebTrends shareholders fail to give the
      necessary approval at a duly-held meeting;

    .
there is a permanent legal prohibition to completing the merger; or

    .
a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
      covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in the
      merger agreement has occurred that would cause the inaccuracy as of
      the effective time of the representations and warranties made by the
      other party to the extent specified in the merger agreement or the
      failure in the performance in all material respects by the other party
      of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to
      closing, and the incapacity to correct the inaccuracy or remedy the
      failure by June 30, 2001;

   (c) by NetIQ, if (1) WebTrends' board of directors has failed to recommend,
or has withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to NetIQ, its approval or
recommendation of, the merger, or has recommended, or entered into, or
publicly announced its intention to enter into a definitive agreement or
agreement in principle as to any other acquisition proposal to the WebTrends
shareholders, or (2) WebTrends has willfully and materially breached the
covenants described under "--Principal Covenants--No Solicitation by
WebTrends" and "--WebTrends Board's Covenant to Recommend.
"

   If the merger agreement is validly terminated, the agreement will become
void without any liability on the part of any party unless the party is in
willful breach thereof.
However, the provisions of the merger agreement
relating to expenses and termination fees, as well as the confidentiality
agreement entered into between NetIQ and WebTrends, will continue in effect
notwithstanding termination of the merger agreement.


Termination Fees Payable by WebTrends

   WebTrends has agreed to pay NetIQ $41.0 million in cash in the following
termination circumstances:

  .
NetIQ terminates the merger agreement as described in paragraph (c) under
    "--Termination" above and at the time of such termination a third party
    has proposed a transaction to acquire at least 20% of WebTrends equity
    interests or assets (an "alternative proposal"); or

  .
either NetIQ or WebTrends terminates the merger agreement in
    circumstances where WebTrends' shareholders do not vote in favor of the
    merger or the merger has not been consummated by June 30, 2001 and a
    third party has publicly announced an alternative proposal;

provided, in either of the cases described above, WebTrends completes a
transaction in which a third party acquires at least 50% of WebTrends equity
interests or assets with twelve months of the termination of the merger
agreement.


Other Expenses

   All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, other than termination
fees payable upon termination under "--Termination Fees Payable by WebTrends,"
will be paid by the party incurring the expenses, whether or not the merger is
consummated, except that NetIQ and WebTrends have agreed to share equally
expenses (other than attorney's and accountant's fees) incurred in the
printing and filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
registration statement of which it is part and filings under the HSR Act.

NetIQ estimates that its merger-related fees and expenses, consisting
primarily of SEC filing fees, fees and expenses of investment banks, attorneys
and accountants, and financial printing and other related charges, will total
approximately $13.0 million if we complete the merger.
WebTrends estimates
that its merger-related fees and expenses, consisting primarily of fees and
expenses of investment banks, attorneys and accountants, and financial
printing and other related charges, will total approximately $8.0 million if
the merger is completed.

Amendments; Waivers

   Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended or waived prior to
closing if the amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by WebTrends, NetIQ and the North Acquisition Corporation or, in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

After approval of the merger agreement by WebTrends shareholders, no amendment
or waiver that by law requires further approval by shareholders may be made
without such further approval.

   Both WebTrends and NetIQ stockholders are advised to obtain current market
quotations for WebTrends common stock and NetIQ common stock.
No assurance can
be given as to the market prices of WebTrends common stock or NetIQ common
stock at any time before the consummation of merger or as to the market price
of NetIQ common stock at any time after merger.
Because the exchange ratio is
fixed, the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate WebTrends
shareholders for decreases in the market price of NetIQ common stock which
could occur before the merger becomes effective.
In the event the market price
of NetIQ common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation of
merger, the value of the NetIQ common stock to be received in the merger in
exchange for WebTrends common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase.


Dividends

   Neither WebTrends nor NetIQ has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its
capital stock.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of WebTrends and NetIQ
has agreed that no changes will be made with respect to

the payment of dividends, except that NetIQ may declare or pay a dividend so
long as WebTrends shareholders receive such dividends or the benefit of such
dividends by adjusting the exchange ratio.
If the merger is not consummated,
the WebTrends and NetIQ boards anticipate that they would continue their policy
of retaining all earnings to finance the expansion of their businesses.

WebTrends and NetIQ expect the combined company to retain all earnings for use
in the operation and expansion of its business and they do not anticipate NetIQ
will pay any cash dividends after the merger.

                     
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements give effect to the proposed merger between NetIQ and WebTrends using
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and to certain
other acquisitions of NetIQ and Mission Critical Software, Inc., or MCS, as
discussed below.

   
On January 16, 2001, NetIQ entered into an agreement to acquire WebTrends
for consideration preliminarily valued at $1.04 billion, consisting of: NetIQ
common stock valued at $915.0 million, options to purchase WebTrends common
stock valued at $112.8 million and estimated direct acquisition costs of
$13.0 million.
The estimated acquisition related costs consist primarily of
investment bank, legal and accounting fees and printing costs to be incurred
which are directly related to the acquisition.

   
The actual consideration for the acquisition of WebTrends cannot yet be
determined since the acquisition has not been completed.
There can be no
assurance that NetIQ and WebTrends will not incur additional charges related to
the merger or that management will be successful in its efforts to integrate
the operations of the two companies.
For the purpose of the following pro forma
financial information, the number of shares of NetIQ common stock assumed to be
issued in the acquisition of WebTrends is approximately 12.7 million.
This
amount is based on the number of shares of WebTrends common stock outstanding
as of January 16, 2001, the date of the merger agreement.
Similarly, the
estimated value of options to purchase NetIQ common stock to be issued in the
acquisition of WebTrends is based on the outstanding options to purchase shares
of WebTrends common stock as of January 16, 2001.
The actual number of shares
of NetIQ common stock and options to be issued will be based on the actual
outstanding shares of common stock and options of WebTrends as of the date of
completion of the merger.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
information includes adjustments to give effect to the following acquisitions
by NetIQ and MCS accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for
business combinations:

  .  
MCS by NetIQ;

  .  
Ganymede Software, Inc., or Ganymede, by MCS;

  .  
Sirana Software, Inc., or Sirana, by NetIQ; and

  .  
Software Realization, Inc., or SRI, by NetIQ.

   
On May 15, 2000, pursuant to a merger agreement, NetIQ acquired all
outstanding shares of MCS for approximately 18.8 million shares of common stock
valued at approximately $1.3 billion, assumed approximately 4.9 million options
valued at approximately $285.0 million and incurred approximately $10.0 million
of direct merger costs, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.6
billion.
MCS provided systems administration and operations management software
products for corporate and Internet-based Windows NT and Windows 2000 networks.

   
On March 10, 2000, MCS acquired all outstanding shares of Ganymede for
2,750,000 shares of common stock of MCS valued at $171.2 million and incurred
approximately $4.2 million of direct merger costs, for a total purchase price
of approximately $175.4 million.
Ganymede was a developer of network and
application performance management solutions.

   
On March 10, 2000, NetIQ acquired all outstanding shares of Sirana for
approximately 27,000 shares of common stock and cash valued at approximately
$2.5 million and incurred approximately $200,000 of direct merger costs, for a
total purchase price of approximately $2.7 million.
Sirana was a developer of
web-based enterprise analysis and reporting solutions for Microsoft BackOffice.

   
On July 17, 2000, NetIQ acquired all outstanding shares of SRI for cash of
approximately $745,000, assumed liabilities of approximately $528,000 and
incurred approximately $150,000 of direct merger costs, for a total purchase
price of approximately $1.4 million.
SRI was a professional services company
focused on delivering packaged training and development offerings.

   
The accompanying pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements are presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

   The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet
combines the unaudited historical condensed consolidated balance sheet of NetIQ
and the audited historical condensed consolidated balance sheet of WebTrends as
of December 31, 2000.
No adjustments were made to the NetIQ balance sheet for
the acquisitions of MCS, Ganymede, Sirana and SRI as these acquisitions were
consummated prior to December 31, 2000.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of
operations of NetIQ give effect to the transactions as if they had been
consummated at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The unaudited
pro forma combined consolidated statement of operations of NetIQ for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000, includes the audited historical statements of
operations of NetIQ for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000.
These results have
been adjusted to include the unaudited historical statement of operations of
MCS, Ganymede, and Sirana for the period from July 1, 1999, to the date of the
acquisition as well as the unaudited historical statement of operations of SRI
for the year ended June 30, 2000.
These adjusted results are combined with the
unaudited historical statements of operations of WebTrends for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2000.

   
The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated statement of operations of
NetIQ for the six months ended December 31, 2000, has been adjusted to include
the unaudited historical statement of operations of SRI for the period from
July 1, 2000, to the date of the acquisition, and combines these results with
the unaudited historical statement of operations of WebTrends for the six
months ended December 31, 2000.

   
The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that
would have occurred if the merger had been consummated at the beginning of the
earliest period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating
results or financial position.
The pro forma adjustments are based upon
information and assumptions available at the time of the filing of this
document.
The pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying notes thereto and with NetIQ's and WebTrends' historical financial
statements and related notes thereto, incorporated by reference in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

   (A)
The following represents the allocations of the purchase prices over the
historical net book values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
the combined business of WebTrends as of the date of the pro forma balance
sheet, and is for illustrative purposes only.
The actual purchase price
allocation will be based on fair values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities as of the actual acquisition dates.
Assuming the transaction
occurred on December 31, 2000, the allocation would have been as follows (in
thousands):

   Working capital.................................................. $   73,321
   Other non-current assets.........................................     16,267
   Deferred stock-based compensation................................     
49,084
   Goodwill and other intangible assets.............................    902,470
                                                                     ----------
   Purchase price................................................... $1,041,142
                                                                     ==========

   The purchase price reflects the accrual of direct costs arising from the
pending merger of NetIQ and WebTrends, estimated at approximately $13.0
million.
The adjustment also reflects the elimination of the equity of
WebTrends and the issuance of NetIQ shares and options.
The adjustment also
reflects a reduction in the WebTrends deferred revenue related to software
license revenue that has been deferred due to installation not being completed.

Lastly, the adjustment reflects an increase in the assumed liabilities of
WebTrends related to WebTrends' estimated cost arising from the pending merger
of approximately $8.0 million.

   (B)
These results include the following:

  .
MCS unaudited historical statement of operations for the period from July
    1, 1999 to May 14, 2000 (pre-acquisition period)

  .
Ganymede unaudited historical results of operations for the period from
    July 1, 1999 to March 9, 2000 (pre-acquisition period)

  .
Sirana unaudited historical results of operations for the period from
    July 1, 1999 to March 9, 2000 (preacquisition period)

  .
SRI unaudited historical results of operations for the year ended June
    30, 2000.

   
(C) The pro forma adjustment represents amortization of goodwill and other
intangible assets related to the MCS, Ganymede, Sirana and SRI business
combinations that would have been recorded during the year ended June 30, 2000.

   
(D)
The pro forma adjustment is based on the assumption that there would be
no deferred stock-based compensation for options issued by MCS, Ganymede,
Sirana and SRI for the year ended June 30, 2000.

   
(E) The pro forma adjustment reflects the weighted average effect of the
issuance of approximately 18.8 million shares in the acquisitions not otherwise
included in the historical NetIQ basic net loss per share calculation.
The
computation of diluted net loss per share excludes securities outstanding that
could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were
excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share in the periods
presented, as their effect would have been antidilutive.

   
(F) The pro forma adjustment represents the amortization of the intrinsic
value of unvested options assumed in the merger with WebTrends over their
remaining life during the year ended June 30, 2000, and the six months ended
December 31, 2000.

   
(G) The pro forma adjustment represents the amortization of goodwill and
other intangible assets (per the allocation in (A) above) that would have been
recorded during the year ended June 30, 2000, and the six months ended December
31, 2000.

   
The pro forma adjustment is based on the assumption that the entire amount
identified as goodwill and other intangible assets in NetIQ's acquisition of
WebTrends will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period.

NetIQ has not yet completed the valuation of the actual intangible assets
acquired.
When completed, certain amounts identified as intangible assets may
be amortized over periods other than the three-year period represented in the
pro forma statement of operations.
Additionally, a portion of the purchase
price may be identified as in-process research and development.
This amount,
if any, will be charged to operating results of NetIQ in the period the merger
is completed and the acquisition accounting and valuation amounts are
finalized.

   
(H) Reflects the issuance of approximately 12.7 million shares of NetIQ
common stock to WebTrends stockholders based on the number of WebTrends shares
outstanding as of January 16, 2001, the date of the merger agreement.
The
computation of diluted net loss per share excludes securities outstanding that
could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were
excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share in the periods
presented, as their effect would have been antidilutive.

   
(I)
This adjustment is to remove the effect of the in-process research and
development expense included in the historical results of operations of NetIQ
related to the acquisition of MCS.

   
(J) This pro forma adjustment reflects the tax impact of the amortization
of identified intangible assets.
