                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholder:

     You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting of stockholders of
Cell Pathways, Inc. to be held on           ,             , 2003, at   :  a.m.,
local time, at                , located at                ,                ,
Pennsylvania.

     At the special meeting, Cell Pathways will ask you to vote on the merger of
Cell Pathways with a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the
merger, you will receive 0.0567 shares of OSI common stock for each share of
Cell Pathways common stock that you own. In addition, you will receive a
five-year contingent value right that may entitle you to an additional 0.04
shares of OSI common stock for each share of Cell Pathways common stock that you
own in the event a new drug application is accepted for filing by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration within five years of consummation of the merger for
either of Cell Pathways' two leading clinical candidates, Aptosyn(R) (exisulind)
or CP461. You will receive cash for any fractional shares of OSI common stock
that you would be entitled to receive in the merger.

     OSI's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
trading symbol "OSIP," and on April   , 2003, its closing price was $     per
share.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors has carefully reviewed and considered
the terms and conditions of the merger. Based on its review, the Cell Pathways
Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of February 7, 2003, among OSI, CP Merger Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI, and Cell Pathways and the transactions
contemplated thereby, are fair to and in the best interests of Cell Pathways and
its stockholders. THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. Cell Pathways cannot complete the merger unless the
merger agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
of Cell Pathways common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting. Failure to submit a signed proxy or vote in person at the special
meeting will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement. Only stockholders who owned shares of Cell Pathways common stock at
the close of business on             , 2003 will be entitled to vote at the
special meeting.

     PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN, DATE AND RETURN YOUR PROXY. If you hold your shares
in "street name," you should instruct your broker how to vote in accordance with
the voting instruction form furnished by your broker.

     The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus explains the merger and merger

                      QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

     Throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, references to "we", "our" and
"us" mean OSI and Cell Pathways, collectively.

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:  If the merger is completed, for each share of Cell Pathways common stock you
    hold, you will be entitled to receive 0.0567 of a share of OSI common stock
    and a contingent value right to receive 0.04 of a share of OSI common stock
    in the event a new drug application is accepted for filing with the U.S.
    Food and Drug Administration within five years of consummation of the merger
    for either of Cell Pathways' two clinical candidates, Aptosyn(R) (exisulind)
    or CP461.

Q:  WHERE WILL MY SHARES OF OSI COMMON STOCK BE LISTED?

A:  The OSI common stock received by the Cell Pathways stockholders in the
    merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
    "OSIP".

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  Carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy
    statement/prospectus. Then, please complete, sign and date your proxy and
    return it as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the
    special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy your shares will be
    voted as you indicate in your proxy. If you sign and send in your proxy but
    do not indicate how you want to vote, Cell Pathways will count your proxy as
    a vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement. IF YOU ABSTAIN FROM VOTING OR
    DO NOT VOTE BY NOT RETURNING YOUR PROXY CARD, IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A
    VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED?

A:  OSI stockholder approval is not required to adopt the merger agreement. Cell
    Pathways cannot consummate the merger unless the merger agreement is adopted
    by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Cell Pathways common
    stock outstanding and entitled to vote at a special meeting called for the
    purpose of adopting the merger agreement.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY?

A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted. You
    can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a written notice
    stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete
    and submit a new proxy dated after the date of your original proxy. If you
    choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of
    revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary of Cell Pathways at 702
    Electronic Drive, Horsham, PA 19044. Third, you can attend the special
    meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the meeting, however, will not
    revoke your proxy; you must also vote at the special meeting.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A:  Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
    vote. You should instruct your broker how to vote in accordance with the
    voting instruction form furnished by your broker. WITHOUT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS,
    YOUR BROKER WILL NOT VOTE YOUR SHARES, WHICH WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A VOTE
    AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY CELL PATHWAYS STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for
    exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock
    certificates with your proxy.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER TO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF
    CELL PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK?

A:  Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Cell Pathways common stock
    that is unvested as of the date that the Cell Pathways stockholders adopt
    the merger agreement will accelerate in full and be immediately vested and
    exercisable. Any options that are not exercised

                                       -iv-

prior to the effective time of the merger will, in accordance with their terms,
terminate.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER TO WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF
    CELL PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK?

A:  At the effective time of the merger, OSI will assume each outstanding and
    unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Cell Pathways common stock. Each
    of the assumed warrants will continue to be governed by the same terms and
    conditions as were applicable to the respective Cell Pathways warrant except
    that the exercise price of the warrant and the number of shares of OSI
    common stock for which the warrant is exercisable will be adjusted pursuant
    to a certificate of adjustment based on the exchange ratio contained in the
    merger agreement.

Q:  WILL I BE PERMITTED TO EXERCISE OPTIONS OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF
    CELL PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:  Whether you can exercise any options or warrants that you hold to purchase
    shares of Cell Pathways common stock prior to the special meeting depends
    upon the terms of such options and warrants. The fact that Cell Pathways
    entered into the merger agreement has no effect on your ability to exercise
    any options or warrants that you hold, except that, as noted above, all
    unvested options will become vested and exercisable as of the date the Cell
    Pathways stockholders adopt the merger agreement and will terminate at the
    effective time. Holders of options will be provided a period of at least two
    days following adoption of the merger agreement by the Cell Pathways
    stockholders to exercise options in accordance with their terms.

Q:  WILL I BE PERMITTED TO VOTE THE SHARES OF CELL PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK
    UNDERLYING ANY OPTIONS OR WARRANTS THAT I HOLD AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:  No. You will not be permitted to vote at the special meeting the shares of
    Cell Pathways common stock underlying any options or warrants that you hold,
    unless you have exercised the options or warrants pursuant to their terms
    prior to the record date for the special meeting.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. If the
    merger agreement is adopted by the Cell Pathways stockholders, we expect to
    complete the merger in the second quarter of 2003.

Q:  HOW MANY SHARES OF OSI COMMON STOCK WILL BE ISSUED TO THE CELL PATHWAYS
    STOCKHOLDERS AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER?

A:  It is estimated that OSI will issue 2,238,283 shares of its common stock to
    the Cell Pathways stockholders in the merger (excluding shares underlying
    the contingent value rights), based on the number of shares of Cell Pathways
    common stock outstanding on March 5, 2003 and assuming no exercise of
    options and warrants. Assuming the exercise of all outstanding options and
    warrants, it is estimated that OSI would issue 2,467,644 shares of its
    common stock to the Cell Pathways stockholders in the merger.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OSI COMMON STOCK WILL THIS REPRESENT?

A:  Assuming no exercise of options and warrants to purchase Cell Pathways
    common stock, these shares (which do not include the shares underlying the
    contingent value rights) will represent approximately 5.79% of the
    outstanding OSI common stock after the merger. OSI common stock held by its
    stockholders before the merger will represent approximately 94.21% of the
    outstanding OSI common stock after the merger.

     This summary highlights what we believe is the most important information
about the merger. To more fully understand the transaction, you should read this
entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the materials attached as annexes,
as well as the other documents to which we have referred you. See "Where You Can
Find More Information" on page 80. The page references in parentheses will
direct you to a more detailed description of each topic presented in this
summary.

                                 THE COMPANIES

OSI (SEE PAGE 54)

improve the quality-of-life for cancer patients worldwide.

The executive offices of OSI, a Delaware corporation, are located at 58 South
Service Road, Suite 110, Melville, NY 11747, and its telephone number at these
offices is (631) 962-2000.

CELL PATHWAYS (SEE PAGE 58)

Cell Pathways is a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the
research and development of products to treat and prevent cancer, and the future
commercialization of such products.

offices is (215) 706-3800.

                                   THE MERGER

SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION (SEE PAGE 40)

In the merger, CP Merger Corporation, a specially formed, wholly-owned Delaware
subsidiary of OSI, will be merged with and into Cell Pathways. Cell Pathways
will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI.

The merger will occur following adoption of the merger agreement by the Cell
Pathways stockholders and satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to this
proxy statement/prospectus and the merger agreement. The merger agreement is
attached as Annex A. We encourage you to read it because it is the legal
document that governs the merger.

WHAT THE HOLDERS OF CELL PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 40)

In the merger, Cell Pathways common stockholders will receive OSI common stock
and contingent value rights to receive additional shares of OSI common stock.
When OSI and Cell Pathways complete the merger, each outstanding share of Cell
Pathways common stock will convert into 0.0567 of a share of OSI common stock
and into a contingent value right. OSI will not issue any fractional shares of
OSI common stock in the merger. Instead, Cell Pathways stockholders will receive
cash for fractional shares.

Each contingent value right represents the right to receive 0.04 of a share of
OSI common stock in the event a new drug application, or an NDA, is accepted for
filing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for either of Cell
Pathways' two clinical candidates, Aptosyn(R) (exisulind) or CP461 within five
years of consummation of the merger. The contingent value rights, which are not
transferable, will be governed by the contingent value rights agreement, the
form of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. We
encourage you to read this agreement carefully because it is the legal document
that governs the contingent value rights.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 43)

We intend that the merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger does qualify as a
reorganization, no gain or loss will be recognized by Cell Pathways, OSI or the
merger subsidiary by reason of the merger. Except for any cash you receive
instead of fractional shares, you will not recognize gain or loss on your
receipt of OSI common stock or contingent value rights in exchange for your
shares of Cell Pathways common stock in the merger; however, a portion of any
additional shares issued pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement will
be treated as taxable interest income to the recipient at the time such
additional shares are issued and will be deductible as an interest expense by
OSI subject to applicable Internal Revenue Code limitations.

BECAUSE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON EACH CELL
PATHWAYS STOCKHOLDER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN
TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU
OF THE MERGER.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 50)

If the merger is consummated, holders of Cell Pathways common stock who do not
vote in favor of the merger will have the right under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law to demand appraisal of their shares. Under
Section 262, stockholders who demand appraisal and comply with the applicable
statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the
fair value of their shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of that fair
value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any. The value so
determined could be more or less than or equal to the price per share to be paid
in the merger. OSI will not be obligated to close the merger if the aggregate
number of shares held by Cell Pathways stockholders demanding appraisal rights
exceeds 7.5% of the number of shares of Cell Pathways common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Section 262
of the Delaware General Corporation Law is included in this proxy statement/
prospectus as Annex D.

THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 29)

In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the Cell Pathways Board of
Directors considered, among other things:

     - Cell Pathways' present financial condition and difficulty in raising
       additional capital to meet its ongoing commitments as well as its drug
       development goals;

     - Cell Pathways' inability to meet the continued listing requirements of
       the Nasdaq National Market; and

     - the greater ability of OSI to fund research and development of Cell
       Pathways' products.

OPINION OF CELL PATHWAYS' FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 30)

In connection with the merger, the Board of Directors of Cell Pathways received
a written opinion of CIBC World Markets Corp., Cell Pathways' financial advisor,
as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration
to be received by the holders of Cell Pathways common stock. The full text of
the CIBC World Markets opinion, dated February 6, 2003, is attached to this
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. We encourage you to read this opinion
carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. CIBC
WORLD MARKETS' OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION FROM A FINANCIAL POINT
OF VIEW. THE OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES
NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO HOW ANY STOCKHOLDER
SHOULD VOTE OR ACT WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE MERGER.

OSI'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 36)

In reaching its decision to approve the merger, OSI's Board of Directors
considered, among other things:

     - the quality of Cell Pathways' technology platform and the potential of
       its clinical candidates, which may enhance OSI's ability to produce
       effective therapies for cancer;

     - the expansion of OSI's product pipeline by adding Cell Pathways' product
       pipeline, which includes one product candidate in Phase III clinical
       trials and one product candidate in Phase II clinical trials; and

     - the addition of a marketed product in Gelclair(TM).

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

DATE AND PURPOSE (SEE PAGE 24)

We will hold the special meeting at           , located at           ,
Pennsylvania, at   :  a.m., local time, on           ,           , 2003.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 24)

If you owned shares of Cell Pathways common stock as of the close of business on
          , 2003,

the record date for the special meeting, you may vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement.

On that date, there were           shares of Cell Pathways common stock
outstanding. Cell Pathways stockholders will have one vote at the meeting for
each share of common stock owned on the record date.

QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTES (SEE PAGES 24)

The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Cell Pathways common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date. Because the required vote
of Cell Pathways stockholders is based upon the number of outstanding shares of
Cell Pathways common stock, rather than upon the shares actually voted, the
failure by the holder of any such shares to submit a proxy or to vote in person
at the special meeting, including abstentions and broker non-votes, will have
the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 30)

AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS
UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CELL PATHWAYS AND
ITS STOCKHOLDERS. THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

                           OTHER SELECTED INFORMATION

INTERESTS OF CELL PATHWAYS' DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 37)

The officers and directors of Cell Pathways may have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of Cell Pathways stockholders.
The Cell Pathways and OSI Boards of Directors were aware of these interests and
considered them in approving the merger agreement. Certain of Cell Pathways'
executive officers previously entered into change of control agreements which
entitle them to severance benefits upon their termination in certain instances
following the consummation of the merger. In addition, three of Cell Pathways'
executive officers will enter into consulting agreements with OSI upon
consummation of the merger.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (SEE PAGE 41)

Upon stockholder adoption of the merger agreement, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Cell Pathways common stock under its various option plans
that is unvested will accelerate in full and be immediately vested and
exercisable. Any options that are not exercised prior to the effective time of
the merger will terminate in accordance with the terms of such plans. Holders of
options will be provided a period of at least two days following adoption of the
merger agreement by Cell Pathways stockholders to exercise options in accordance
with their terms.

Before the effective time of the merger, Cell Pathways will give the required
notice of cancellation of its employee stock purchase plan to participants and
each participant will have the right to exercise his or her outstanding options
under such plan in full based on accumulated payroll deductions credited to his
or her account.

At the effective time of the merger, OSI will assume each outstanding and
unexercised warrant to purchase shares of the Cell Pathways common stock. The
number of shares for which such warrants are exercisable and the per share
exercise price for the warrants will be adjusted pursuant to a certificate of
adjustment based upon the exchange ratio used in the merger agreement.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS (SEE PAGE 42)

OSI has agreed to give the Cell Pathways employees who continue their employment
after the merger credit under OSI's employee benefits plans for services
rendered to Cell Pathways while employed by Cell Pathways. OSI has also agreed
to assume Cell Pathways' employment, severance and other compensation
agreements.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 42)

OSI will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting for
business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the
Unites States of America.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 53)

We are not aware of any material governmental or regulatory requirements that
must be complied with regarding the merger, other than federal securities

laws and the filing of documents describing principal terms of the merger
agreement with the secretary of state of Delaware.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 47)

The following conditions, among others must be satisfied before completing the
merger:

     - Cell Pathways stockholders must adopt the merger agreement;

     - the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a
       part must be declared effective and must not be the subject of any stop
       order or related proceeding;

     - there can be no legal restraint that would effect the consummation of the
       merger, prohibit or limit the operation of OSI or Cell Pathways as a
       result of the merger, or have a material adverse effect on OSI or Cell
       Pathways;

     - OSI's common stock issued in the merger must be authorized for listing on
       the Nasdaq National Market; and

     - all necessary regulatory approvals must be obtained.

"NO SOLICITATION" PROVISIONS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 46)

The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Cell Pathways from
seeking an acquisition proposal. In the event of a violation of this covenant by
Cell Pathways, a termination fee will be payable to OSI.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 49)

We can mutually terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger.
Either OSI or Cell Pathways may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is
not completed by August 6, 2003, and under other circumstances, including
failure to obtain required stockholder approval.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES (SEE PAGE 50)

Cell Pathways has agreed to pay OSI $1,250,000 if the merger agreement is
terminated in any of the following circumstances:

     - OSI or Cell Pathways terminates the merger agreement because the Cell
       Pathways Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its
       recommendation of the merger after receiving a superior proposal and the
       Cell Pathways Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its
       legal adviser, that failure to take such action could reasonably be
       expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties;

     - OSI or Cell Pathways terminates the merger agreement because Cell
       Pathways stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and an
       acquisition proposal, which was proposed prior to such termination, is
       consummated within nine months of such termination; or

     - OSI terminates the merger agreement for material misrepresentations or
       uncured breaches by Cell Pathways and an acquisition proposal, which was
       proposed prior to such termination, is consummated within nine months of
       such termination.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS AND NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING (SEE PAGE 72)

As of March 5, 2003 there were 444 stockholders of OSI of record who held an
aggregate of 36,440,246 shares of OSI common stock.

As of March 5, 2003, there were 1,302 stockholders of Cell Pathways of record
who held an aggregate of 39,475,882 shares of Cell Pathways common stock.

COMPARATIVE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 73)

When OSI and Cell Pathways complete the merger, Cell Pathways stockholders will
hold shares of OSI common stock. Their rights will thus be governed by OSI's
charter and by-laws, as well as the Delaware General Corporation Law.

COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICE INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (SEE PAGE 70)

OSI common stock (Nasdaq: OSIP) and Cell Pathways common stock (Nasdaq: CLPA)
are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market. The following table presents the
market value of OSI common stock (on a historical basis) and the market value of
Cell Pathways common stock (on a historical and equivalent per share basis) as
of February 7, 2003, the last business day before OSI and Cell Pathways publicly
announced the merger agreement. The equivalent per share value of Cell Pathways
common stock equals the closing price of OSI common stock multiplied by 0.0567,
the number of shares of OSI common stock that each Cell Pathways stockholder
will receive in the merger for each share of

Cell Pathways common stock held by such stockholder.

We encourage you to obtain current market quotations for OSI common stock and
Cell Pathways common stock.

The market price of OSI common stock is likely to fluctuate before and after the
merger is completed. OSI cannot predict the future prices for its stock, or on
which markets it will be traded in the future.

No cash dividends have ever been paid or declared on shares of Cell Pathways
common stock or OSI common stock. OSI does not anticipate paying cash dividends
on its stock in the foreseeable future.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THE
OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND THE
DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN
CONSIDERING WHAT ACTION TO TAKE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

         RISKS RELATING TO CELL PATHWAYS IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, CELL PATHWAYS MAY LACK THE MONEY AND PERSONNEL
TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.

     In the event that the merger is not consummated, Cell Pathways will require
substantial additional funds for its operations. At December 31, 2002, Cell
Pathways had $10.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, which it believes would
be sufficient, together with expected revenues, to fund operations only through
the second quarter of 2003. Cell Pathways does not know if additional funding
will be available at all or on acceptable terms. If Cell Pathways raises funds
by issuing equity securities, current stockholders may experience substantial
dilution. In addition, Cell Pathways may grant future investors rights which are
superior to those of current stockholders. If Cell Pathways raises funds by
issuing indebtedness, Cell Pathways may be subject to significant restrictions
on its operations. In addition, Cell Pathways has recently reduced its workforce
to decrease future expenses. If the merger is not consummated, Cell Pathways may
have to further reduce its workforce which would compromise its ability to
continue operations. Cell Pathways expects to pay approximately $880,000 in
professional fees incurred in connection with the merger even if it is not
consummated.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, CELL PATHWAYS' COMMON STOCK WILL LIKELY BE
DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET.

     Although Cell Pathways' common stock is presently listed on the Nasdaq
National Market, it must maintain certain minimum financial requirements to
avoid being delisted. In January 2003, Cell Pathways received notification from
Nasdaq that its common stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market
because its share price fell below the minimum bid requirements and thereby
failed to comply with Nasdaq marketplace rules. Cell Pathways appealed the
delisting notification and attended a hearing with Nasdaq which was held on
February 27, 2003. On March 21, 2003, Cell Pathways was informed that its common
stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market until June 30,
2003 in order to allow consummation of the merger, provided Cell Pathways
complies with all of the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq
National Market with the exception of the minimum bid requirement. If Cell
Pathways' common stock is delisted, the liquidity of Cell Pathways' common stock
would be impaired, and Cell Pathways' efforts to raise additional capital would
be negatively impacted.

CELL PATHWAYS HAS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE
WHICH MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO DECREASE.

     Cell Pathways is a development stage pharmaceutical company that has
experienced significant operating losses since its inception in 1990. Cell
Pathways reported operating losses of $18.2 million, $33.1 million and $29.2
million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and as of December 31, 2002, had
an accumulated deficit of $141.2 million. Cell Pathways has not received any
revenue from the sale of its own products, none of which has been approved for
marketing, and has received only immaterial revenues from marketing and selling
the products of others. Cell Pathways expects to incur additional operating
losses for at least the next several years. If Cell Pathways succeeds in
obtaining marketing approval for any of its product candidates, it will incur
significant manufacturing and marketing costs. Cell Pathways' ability to achieve
profitability, if the merger is not consummated, is dependent on its ability,
alone or with others, among other things, to:

     - obtain additional financing;

     - successfully complete the development of its product candidates;

     - obtain required regulatory approvals;

     - successfully manufacture and market, or have others successfully
       manufacture and market, its product candidates;

     - successfully market any products it may in-license from third parties;
       and

     - gain market acceptance for its product candidates.

THE TERMINATION FEE PROVIDED FOR IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER
COMPANIES FROM TRYING TO ACQUIRE CELL PATHWAYS IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED.

     Cell Pathways has agreed to pay a $1.25 million termination fee to OSI in
specified circumstances if the merger agreement is terminated and within nine
months thereafter Cell Pathways consummates a strategic transaction with a
company other than OSI. The termination fee could discourage other companies
from trying to acquire Cell Pathways.

                          RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IS FIXED, AT THE TIME
THAT YOU VOTE ON THE MERGER, YOU WILL NOT KNOW THE MARKET VALUE OF THE OSI
COMMON STOCK YOU WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER.

     Each share of Cell Pathways common stock will be exchanged for 0.0567
shares of OSI common stock and a contingent value right to receive 0.04 shares
of OSI common stock upon completion of the merger regardless of changes in the
market value of Cell Pathways common stock or OSI common stock. The contingent
value right represents a right to receive a fraction of a share of OSI common
stock for each share of Cell Pathways common stock in the event an NDA is
accepted for filing by the FDA for either of Cell Pathways' two clinical
candidates, Aptosyn(R) (exisulind) or CP461 within five years of consummation of
the merger. These exchange ratios are fixed numbers and the merger agreement
does not contain any provision to adjust these ratios for changes in the market
price of either Cell Pathways common stock or OSI common stock. Neither party is
permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the
market price of OSI common stock or Cell Pathways common stock. Consequently,
the specific dollar value of OSI common stock you will receive will depend on
the market value of OSI common stock at the time of completion of the merger and
may decrease from the date that you submit your proxy. You are urged to obtain
recent market quotations for OSI common stock and Cell Pathways common stock.
Neither OSI nor Cell Pathways can predict or give any assurances as to the
market price of OSI common stock at any time before or after the merger. The
prices of OSI common stock and Cell Pathways common stock may vary because of
factors such as:

     - changes in the business, operating results or prospects of OSI or Cell
       Pathways;

     - actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations of
       OSI or Cell Pathways;

     - market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed;

     - the timing of the completion of the merger;

     - announcements or launching of technological innovations or new
       therapeutic products by others;

     - negative or neutral clinical trial results;

     - developments concerning strategic alliance agreements;

     - negative clinical or safety results from OSI's and/or Cell Pathways'
       competitors' products;

     - changes in government regulation including pricing controls;

     - delays with the FDA in the approval process for Tarceva(TM) and other
       clinical candidates;

     - developments in patent or other proprietary rights;

     - public concern as to the safety of OSI's and/or Cell Pathways' products
       and potential products;

     - future sales of substantial amounts of OSI's common stock by existing
       stockholders; and

     - comments by securities analysts and general market conditions.

THE CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF AN NDA FOR APTOSYN(R)
OR CP461 IS NOT ACCEPTED FOR FILING BY THE FDA WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF CONSUMMATION
OF THE MERGER.

     After the merger, Aptosyn(R) and CP461 will be integrated into OSI's
product pipeline and will consequently be subject to the same development
considerations and risks that OSI's current potential oncology products face.
Aptosyn(R) and CP461 may be found to be ineffective or to cause harmful side
effects in the course of their respective clinical trials which could result in
a determination to cease development of either or both of such products.
Additionally, conducting successful clinical trials often takes a number of
years. It is possible that sufficient results from such trials needed for an NDA
filing may not be achieved within the five-year term of the contingent value
rights. (See "Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to OSI" beginning on page 10.)

IF OSI IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING AND ASSIMILATING THE CELL PATHWAYS
BUSINESS INTO ITS OWN BUSINESS, THEN THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER WILL NOT BE
FULLY REALIZED AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OSI'S COMMON STOCK MAY BE NEGATIVELY
AFFECTED.

     OSI and Cell Pathways entered into the merger agreement with the
expectation that the merger will result in benefits arising out of the
combination of the anti-cancer platforms of OSI and Cell Pathways. To realize
benefits from the merger, OSI will face the following post-merger challenges:

     - transitioning the clinical trials for Aptosyn(R) and CP461 and continuing
       development of these clinical candidates; and

     - developing new products that utilize the assets and resources acquired
       from Cell Pathways.

     OSI anticipates that it will take between six and nine months to
effectively transition full management and oversight for Aptosyn(R) and CP461 to
the OSI development group. In order to provide for a smooth transition, OSI has
developed a detailed transition plan that includes the maintenance of temporary
employment arrangements with certain Cell Pathways employees during the
transition period. The loss of these temporary employees could cause some delay
in the programs and require a modest increase in funding paid to contract
research organizations to support the studies. These challenges, if not
successfully met by OSI, could result in diversion of OSI management and
employee attention.

THE ISSUANCE OF OSI COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER COULD DECREASE
THE MARKET PRICE OF OSI COMMON STOCK.

     Based on the number of shares of Cell Pathways common stock outstanding as
of March 5, 2003, at the closing of the merger, OSI will issue to Cell Pathways
stockholders 2,238,283 shares of OSI common stock and 39,475,882 contingent
value rights, assuming no exercise of outstanding options or warrants to
purchase Cell Pathways common stock before the merger becomes effective, and
2,467,644 shares of OSI common stock and 43,521,051 contingent value rights,
assuming full exercise of all options and warrants outstanding to purchase Cell
Pathways common stock. The issuance of the OSI common stock may result in
substantial fluctuations in the price of OSI common stock, including a stock
price decline. The decrease may or may not be the result of the dilutive effect
of the additional shares to be issued in connection with the merger. The
issuance of these shares could also impair OSI's ability to raise capital
through sales of additional common stock.

CELL PATHWAYS' OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS THAT
MAY INFLUENCE THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

     In considering the recommendation of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
to approve the merger, Cell Pathways stockholders should recognize that some of
Cell Pathways directors and officers may have interests which differ from those
of Cell Pathways stockholders because of employment arrangements, consulting
arrangements, change of control agreements, indemnification and liability
insurance and other reasons. These reasons are described under the heading "The
Merger and The Merger Agreement -- Interests of Cell Pathways' Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 37.

OSI FACES DIFFERENT MARKET RISKS FROM THOSE FACED BY CELL PATHWAYS AND THESE
RISKS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF OSI COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO YOU TO
DECLINE.

     In the merger you will receive shares of OSI common stock. OSI common stock
has experienced fluctuations in price and volume. The business, strategy and
financial condition of OSI is different from that of Cell Pathways. OSI's
results of operations, as well as the price of OSI common stock, may be affected
by various factors different from those affecting Cell Pathways' results of
operations and its common stock price. Future events that may not have affected
the price of Cell Pathways common stock may cause the price of OSI common stock
to decline.

                             RISKS RELATING TO OSI

ALTHOUGH OSI HAS POTENTIAL ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR TO BE PROMISING AT
EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND IN CLINICAL TRIALS, NONE OF ITS POTENTIAL
ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY REACH THE MARKET FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

     Successful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high
risk. Most projects and development candidates fail to reach the market. OSI's
success depends on the discovery of new drugs that it can commercialize. It is
possible that none of OSI's potential oncology products, including Tarceva(TM),
may ever reach the market for a number of reasons. They may be found ineffective
or cause harmful side effects during pre-clinical testing or clinical trials or
fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. OSI may find that certain
products cannot be manufactured on a commercial scale basis and, therefore, they
may not be economical to produce. OSI's products could also fail to achieve
market acceptance or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights
of third parties.

     OSI has a number of oncology product candidates in various stages of
development and does not expect them to be commercially available for a number
of years, if at all. All but six of OSI's product candidates are in the
pre-clinical development phase. The six candidates that are in clinical trials
will still require significant research and development and regulatory approvals
before OSI or its collaborative partners will be able to market them.

IF OSI HAS A SETBACK IN ITS TARCEVA(TM) PROGRAM, ITS STOCK PRICE WOULD ALMOST
CERTAINLY DECLINE.

     OSI is currently conducting four Phase III clinical trials for Tarceva(TM).
If it does not receive any positive results from these trials, OSI would need to
conduct additional clinical trials or abandon its Tarceva(TM) program. Since
Tarceva(TM) is OSI's most advanced product candidate, a setback of this nature
would almost certainly cause a decline in its stock price. In August 2002,
AstraZeneca PLC announced unfavorable results from its clinical trials which
were testing its drug candidate, Iressa, which is in the same class of targeted
therapies as Tarceva(TM), in combination with traditional chemotherapy agents
for the treatment of front-line non-small cell lung cancer. While there are
important differences between Iressa and Tarceva(TM) and AstraZeneca's clinical
program and OSI's clinical program, including structure, formulation,
pharmacokinetics and Phase III trial design and dosing, two of OSI's four Phase
III trials are designed to test Tarceva(TM) in combination with chemotherapy
agents for front-line non-small cell lung cancer in studies whose design share
many similarities with AstraZeneca's trials. A positive outcome from these two
trials must now be considered higher risk.

SET-BACKS ON THE PART OF OSI'S COMPETITORS WHO ARE DEVELOPING DRUGS IN THE
HER1/EGFR FIELD HAVE HISTORICALLY CAUSED VOLATILITY IN OSI'S STOCK PRICE AND
COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

     OSI's major competitors who are developing drugs in the HER1/EGFR field
which are similar to OSI's most advanced clinical candidate, Tarceva(TM), have
suffered setbacks with respect to their drug candidates during the last 18
months which have impacted OSI's stock price by raising concerns regarding the
HER1/ EGFR class of targeted therapies. Both AstraZeneca and ImClone Systems
Incorporated, which are each developing drug candidates in the same class of
HER1/EGFR targeted therapies as Tarceva(TM), suffered setbacks in their programs
during the last 18 months. On December 28, 2001, ImClone announced that it had
received a letter from the FDA advising it that the FDA was not accepting for
filing ImClone's rolling Biologics License Application for its drug candidate,
Erbitux, a monoclonal antibody designed to target and block the HER1/EGFR gene,
which was then in Phase II trials. In August 2002, AstraZeneca announced
unfavorable results from its clinical trials that were testing its drug
candidate, Iressa, in combination with traditional chemotherapy agents for the
treatment of front-line non-small cell lung cancer. These setbacks have resulted
in casting doubt amongst some investors on all drug candidates targeting the
HER1/EGFR gene, including Tarceva(TM), which has led to declining stock prices
for OSI and others developing drugs in this class. Although no immediate
material impact on OSI's common stock was seen with the ImClone announcement, on
the day of AstraZeneca's announcement, OSI's stock price declined $18.73 per
share, or 57%. Additional set-backs on the part of OSI's competitors could
result in a further decrease in its stock price.

IF OSI IS UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ACCEPTABLE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF TARCEVA(TM)
DURING CLINICAL TRIALS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL AND
THUS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE AND GENERATE REVENUES FROM TARCEVA(TM).

     OSI must continue to demonstrate, through pre-clinical testing and clinical
trials, that Tarceva(TM) is safe and effective. The results from pre-clinical
testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in
subsequent clinical trials, and OSI cannot be sure that its clinical trials will
demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for
Tarceva(TM). A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even
after obtaining promising results in earlier trials. In addition, certain
clinical trials for oncology drugs are conducted with patients having the most
advanced stages of disease. During the course of treatment, these patients often
die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related
to the pharmaceutical agent being tested. These events can complicate OSI's
analysis of clinical trial results and may lead to misinterpretation of clinical
trial results. Any significant delays in, or termination of, clinical trials for
Tarceva(TM) may hinder OSI's ability to obtain regulatory approval of
Tarceva(TM). Any delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approval
will delay or prevent, respectively, OSI from commercializing and generating
revenues from Tarceva(TM).

IF OSI DOES NOT MAINTAIN ITS CO-DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING ALLIANCE WITH
GENENTECH INC. AND ROCHE FOR TARCEVA(TM), ITS ABILITY TO PROCEED WITH THE TIMELY
AND PROFITABLE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF TARCEVA(TM) MAY BE COMPROMISED OR
DELAYED.

     Tarceva(TM) is being developed in an alliance with Genentech Inc. and
Roche. The development program is managed by the three parties under a global
development committee. Genentech and Roche are each managing one of the Phase
III trials in non-small cell lung cancer testing Tarceva(TM) in combination with
cytotoxic chemotherapy. OSI is managing two Phase III trials in refractory
non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The loss of either party
during the development program could cause a delay in completion of the trials.
If Tarceva(TM) receives regulatory approval, Genentech will lead the marketing
effort in the United States and Roche will market it in the rest of the world.
OSI has entered into agreements with both Genentech and Roche with respect to
the alliance. The term of the OSI/Genentech agreement continues until the date
on which neither OSI nor Genentech is entitled to receive a share of the
operating profits or losses on any products resulting from the collaboration.
The OSI/Genentech agreement is subject to early termination in the event of
certain customary defaults, such as material breach of the agreement and
bankruptcy. In addition, beginning January 8, 2003, Genentech has the right to
terminate the OSI/Genentech agreement with six months prior written notice. The
term of the OSI/Roche agreement continues until the date on which OSI is no
longer entitled to receive a royalty on products resulting from the development
of Tarceva(TM). The OSI/Roche agreement is subject to early termination in the
event of certain customary defaults, such as material breach of the agreement
and bankruptcy. In addition, after July 30, 2003, Roche may terminate the
agreement on a country-by-country basis. After such time OSI also has the right
to terminate the agreement on a country-by-country basis if Roche has not
launched or marketed a product in such country under certain circumstances. If
OSI does not maintain a successful collaborative partnership with Genentech and
Roche for the co-development and commercialization of Tarceva(TM), it may be
forced to focus its efforts internally to commercialize Tarceva(TM) which would
require a greater expenditure of financial resources and may cause a delay in
launch and market penetration while OSI builds its own commercial operation or
seeks alternative partners. Although OSI manages the manufacturing of
Tarceva(TM) for the U.S. market through third party providers, there may be a
delay in its ability to scale up if OSI is required to replace Roche's
manufacturing role in markets outside of the United States.

IF OSI'S COMPETITORS WHO ARE DEVELOPING DRUGS IN THE HER1/EGFR FIELD RECEIVE FDA
APPROVAL FOR THEIR DRUG CANDIDATES AND COMMENCE MARKETING SUCH PRODUCTS
SIGNIFICANTLY IN ADVANCE OF OSI'S LAUNCH OF TARCEVA(TM), THEN ITS ABILITY TO
COMPETE FOR SALES IN THIS MARKET MAY BE A GREATER CHALLENGE.

     If OSI's competitors, some of which have greater resources than OSI,
receive FDA approval for their drugs and begin marketing those products
significantly in advance of OSI's launch of Tarceva(TM), it may be

more difficult for OSI to penetrate the market and its sales may be less than
projected. This could negatively impact OSI's potential future profitability and
the scope of its operations including research and development of OSI's other
oncology drug candidates. AstraZeneca has recently received approval in Japan
for Iressa, its anti-EGFR drug, and has an NDA for Iressa before the FDA.

IF OSI'S COMPETITORS SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ITS OWN, OSI'S PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE RENDERED
LESS COMPETITIVE.

     OSI faces significant competition from industry participants that are
pursuing similar products and technologies as OSI is and are developing
pharmaceutical products that are competitive with OSI's potential products.
Where OSI is developing products independently, some of the organizations
competing with it have greater capital resources, larger overall research and
development staffs and facilities, and more extensive experience in drug
discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval and pharmaceutical
product manufacturing and marketing. With these additional resources, OSI's
competitors may be able to respond to the rapid and significant technological
changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than OSI can.
OSI's future success will depend in large part on its ability to maintain a
competitive position with respect to these technologies. Rapid technological
development may result in OSI's compounds, products or processes becoming
obsolete before OSI can recover any of the expenses incurred to develop them.

     In particular, OSI faces significant competition from other biotechnology
and pharmaceutical companies which are currently developing drugs similar to
Tarceva(TM) that could dilute OSI's potential for sales from Tarceva(TM). OSI is
aware of at least three companies, some of which have resources substantially
greater than OSI does, which currently have drugs similar to Tarceva(TM) in
substantial clinical development programs. In addition to AstraZeneca's Iressa,
ImClone/Bristol Myers Squibb and Abgenix, Inc./Amgen, Inc. are developing a
different kind of product, humanized antibodies, against the HER1/EGFR target.
The ImClone product is currently in Phase III trials, and the Abgenix product is
in Phase II trials. If OSI's competitors succeed in developing drugs similar to
Tarceva(TM) that are more effective than OSI's, OSI's product may not gain
widespread market acceptance.

IF OSI IS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH A COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE MARKETING FOR
NOVANTRONE(R) OR FOR ITS POTENTIAL ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS OTHER THAN TARCEVA(TM), OSI
WILL NEED TO ENTER INTO AND MAINTAIN ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR
COMMERCIALIZATION OF THESE PRODUCTS WHICH COULD SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISH ITS SHARE
OF THE REVENUES FROM THE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS.

     In order to successfully commercialize OSI's other product candidates, OSI
must be able to:

     - manufacture its products in commercial quantities at reasonable costs;

     - obtain reimbursement coverage for its products;

     - compete favorably against other products; and

     - market its products successfully.

     In order to continue to generate sales of Novantrone(R), OSI will need to
establish and maintain a commercial infrastructure.

     OSI may not be successful in establishing a commercial infrastructure to
enable it to accomplish the above with respect to Novantrone(R) and OSI's other
potential products other than Tarceva(TM). If OSI is unsuccessful or delayed in
establishing this infrastructure, it would need to enter into and successfully
maintain additional commercialization agreements. This would result in OSI's
receipt of a decreased share of the revenues generated from the sale of these
products and would result in decreased revenues from sales of Novantrone(R) for
oncology indications.

IF OSI'S COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS GIVE OTHER
PRODUCTS GREATER PRIORITY THAN OSI'S PRODUCTS, OSI'S PRODUCTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO
DELAYS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION THAT MAY
IMPEDE ITS ABILITY TO TAKE THEM TO MARKET BEFORE ITS COMPETITORS. THIS MAY
RENDER OSI'S PRODUCTS OBSOLETE OR MAY RESULT IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUES
FOR OSI.

     OSI relies on some of its collaborative partners and certain third party
contractors to assist with research and development as well as the manufacture
of its potential products in their FDA-approved manufacturing facilities. Some
of its collaborative agreements allow these parties significant discretion in
electing whether or not to pursue the activities that they have agreed to pursue
for OSI. OSI cannot control the amount and timing of resources these parties
devote to its programs or potential products. OSI's potential products may be in
competition with other products for priority of access to these parties'
research and development and manufacturing facilities. If these parties do not
give significant priority to the research and development or manufacture of
OSI's potential products in an effective or timely manner, the clinical
development of OSI's product candidates or their submission for regulatory
approval could be delayed, and OSI's ability to deliver products to the market
on a timely basis could be impaired. Furthermore, OSI may not be able to enter
into any necessary third party research and development or manufacturing
arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all.

IF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DO NOT GRANT OSI OR ITS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS REQUIRED
APPROVALS FOR ANY OF ITS POTENTIAL PRODUCTS, OSI OR ITS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL OSI'S PRODUCTS.

     All of OSI's potential products must undergo an extensive regulatory
approval process in the United States and other countries. This regulatory
process, which includes pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of each
compound to establish its safety and efficacy, can take many years and requires
the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, data obtained from
pre-clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations
that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA and the other
regulatory agencies in additional markets which are material to OSI and its
collaborative partners (i.e., the European Union Health Authorities (EMEA) and
the Japanese Ministry of Health) may delay or deny the approval of OSI's
proposed products. None of OSI's products has yet received governmental
approval, and none may ever do so. If OSI does not receive the required
regulatory approvals, OSI or its collaborative partners will not be able to
manufacture and sell its products.

     Even if OSI obtains regulatory approval, a marketed product and its
manufacturer are subject to continuing review, including post-marketing
surveillance. OSI may be required to withdraw its product from the market if
previously unknown problems are discovered. Violations of regulatory
requirements at any stage may result in various unfavorable consequences to OSI,
including the FDA's imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer
and the holder of the NDA.

OSI'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS CLINICAL DISTRIBUTORS, MANUFACTURERS AND
CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, OR CROS, MAY RESULT IN DELAYS IN COMPLETING, OR
A FAILURE TO COMPLETE, CLINICAL TRIALS IF THEY FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER OSI'S
AGREEMENTS WITH THEM.

     From time to time in the course of product development, OSI may engage
clinical distributors, manufacturers and/or CROs to manufacture and distribute
the product candidate and to conduct and manage clinical studies and to assist
OSI in guiding products through the FDA review and approval process. Because OSI
has engaged and intends to engage clinical distributors, manufacturers and CROs
to help OSI obtain market approval for its drug candidates, many important
aspects of this process have been and will be out of its direct control. If the
clinical distributors, manufacturers and CROs fail to perform their obligations
under OSI's agreements with them or fail to manufacture and distribute the
product candidate and to perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, OSI
may face delays in completing OSI's clinical trials, as well as
commercialization of any drug candidate. Furthermore, any loss or delay in
obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of OSI's
clinical trials and the market approval of drug candidates.

OSI HAS INCURRED LOSSES SINCE ITS INCEPTION, AND OSI EXPECTS TO INCUR LOSSES
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO
DECREASE.

     OSI has had net operating losses since its inception in 1983. At December
31, 2002, OSI's accumulated deficit was approximately $354.3 million. OSI's net
operating losses were $218.5 million, $23.8 million and $16.3 million for fiscal
years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The net operating loss for fiscal 2002
included an in-process research and development charge of $130.2 million related
to the acquisition of certain assets from Gilead Sciences, Inc. OSI's losses
have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development,
acquired in-process research and development and from general and administrative
costs associated with OSI's operations. These costs have exceeded its revenues,
and OSI expects them to continue to do so until OSI generates significant sales
from marketed products.

     OSI expects to continue to incur operating losses over the next few years
as a result of its expenses for the development of Tarceva(TM) and its other
clinical products and its research programs. These expenses include enhancements
in its drug discovery technologies and increases in the resources OSI will
devote to its internally funded proprietary projects. OSI does not expect to
generate revenues from the sale of its potential products for the next few
years, and OSI expects to continue to incur operating losses during this period.

IF OSI CANNOT PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OSI'S ABILITY TO DEVELOP
AND COMMERCIALIZE ITS PRODUCTS WILL BE SEVERELY LIMITED.

     As of February 24, 2003, OSI held 26 U.S. patents, 93 foreign patents, 35
pending applications for U.S. patents, four of which have been allowed, and 165
applications for foreign patents, two of which have been allowed. Moreover, OSI
jointly holds with Pfizer, Inc. rights to numerous issued U.S. and foreign
patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. OSI also jointly
holds, with North Carolina State University, two issued U.S. patents and certain
U.S. and foreign pending patent applications. OSI intends to continue to
aggressively seek patent protection for all of the product candidates that it
has discovered, developed or acquired.

     OSI's success depends, in part, on its ability and its collaborative
partners' ability to obtain patent protection for new product candidates,
maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary
rights of third parties. As with most biotechnology and pharmaceutical
companies, its patent position is highly uncertain and involves complex legal
and factual questions. Without patent and other similar protection, other
companies could offer substantially identical products for sale without
incurring the sizable discovery and development costs that OSI has incurred.
OSI's ability to recover these expenditures and realize profits upon the sale of
products could be diminished.

     The process of obtaining patents can be time consuming and expensive with
no certainty of success. Even if OSI spends the necessary time and money, a
patent may not issue or it may insufficiently protect the technology it was
intended to protect. OSI can never be certain that OSI was first to develop the
technology or that OSI was the first to file a patent application for the
particular technology because most U.S. patent applications are confidential
until a patent issues, and publications in the scientific or patent literature
lag behind actual discoveries.

     The degree of future protection for OSI's proprietary rights will remain
uncertain if its pending patent applications are not approved for any reason or
if OSI is unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are
patentable. Furthermore, third parties may independently develop similar or
alternative technologies, duplicate some or all of its technologies, design
around its patented technologies or challenge its issued patents.

IF OTHER COMPANIES CLAIM THAT OSI INFRINGES ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS, OSI MAY BE SUBJECT TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING LITIGATION AND DELAYS IN
PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

     OSI's processes and potential products may conflict with patents which have
been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others. As the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are filed
and issued, the risk increases that OSI's product candidates may give rise to a

declaration of interference by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or to
claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals.
These entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against OSI seeking
substantial damages or seeking to enjoin OSI from testing, manufacturing or
marketing OSI's products. If any of these actions were successful, OSI may also
be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain the requisite licenses or
rights to use the technology which may not be available to OSI on acceptable
terms, if at all. Any litigation, regardless of the outcome, could be extremely
costly to OSI.

IF OTHER BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY
APPROPRIATE ROYALTIES FOR THE USE OF OSI'S PATENTED "GENE TRANSCRIPTION ESTATE,"
OSI MAY NEED TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF FUNDS AND RESOURCES IF OSI CHOOSES
TO ENFORCE THE PATENTS.

     OSI licenses to other companies rights to use its patented "gene
transcription estate" which consists of drug discovery assays that provide a way
to identify novel product candidates that can control the activity of genes. OSI
believes technology and practices covered by these patents are in widespread use
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To date, OSI has granted
seven licenses to use its gene transcription patents. If other pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies which OSI believes are using its patented technology
are not willing to negotiate license arrangements with OSI on reasonable terms,
OSI may have to choose between abandoning its licensing strategy or initiating
legal proceedings against those companies. Legal action, particularly patent
infringement litigation, is extremely costly.

IF OSI OR ITS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM THIRD
PARTIES, OSI'S REVENUES AND ROYALTIES ON ANY COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCTS COULD BE
REDUCED.

     The development of some of OSI's products may require the use of technology
developed by third parties. The extent to which efforts by other researchers
have resulted or will result in patents and the extent to which OSI or its
collaborative partners are forced to obtain licenses from others, if available,
is currently unknown. If OSI or its collaborative partners must obtain licenses
from third parties, fees must be paid for such licenses. These fees would reduce
the revenues and royalties OSI may receive on commercialized products.

THE USE OF ANY OF OSI'S POTENTIAL PRODUCTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE SALE OF
ANY APPROVED PRODUCTS MAY EXPOSE OSI TO LIABILITY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM THE USE
OF PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES.

     The nature of OSI's business exposes it to potential liability risks
inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of drug discovery
candidates and products. Using OSI's drug candidates in clinical trials may
expose it to product liability claims. These risks will expand with respect to
drugs, if any, that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. While OSI
currently maintains product liability insurance that OSI believes is adequate,
such insurance may not be available at reasonable rates, if at all, in the
future. If OSI does not or cannot maintain adequate insurance coverage, OSI may
incur significant liability if a product liability claim arises.

IF OSI CANNOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS
OR ITS PROJECTED FUTURE SALES ARE DELAYED OR DIMINISHED, OSI MAY HAVE TO LIMIT
THE SCOPE OF ITS PROPRIETARY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN FUTURE YEARS OR ENTER INTO
MORE RESTRICTIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS.

     As of December 31, 2002, OSI's cash reserves, consisting of cash, cash
equivalents, restricted short and long-term investments, and unrestricted
short-term investments, aggregated $445.8 million. Following the completion and
assimilation of the Cell Pathways and Novantrone(R) transactions, OSI estimates
its cash reserves will decline to approximately $250 million as of September 30,
2003. Additionally, OSI estimates its cash burn will be less than $100 million
in fiscal 2004, and has established a goal of achieving profitability and
positive cash flow within 18 to 24 months of a successful market launch of
Tarceva(TM).

     OSI's future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including
the size and complexity of OSI's research and development programs, the progress
of pre-clinical testing and early stage clinical trials, the time and costs
involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for OSI's product candidates, the
costs of manufacturing arrangements and the costs of commercialization
activities.

     Although OSI believes its current cash reserves are sufficient for its
near-term operating needs, OSI may choose to raise additional funds through
public or private sales of its securities, including equity securities, as well
as from collaborative partners in order to further its growth. OSI may not be
able to obtain adequate funding from the sale of its securities or from
collaborative partners on reasonable or acceptable terms, if at all.
Furthermore, any additional equity financings may dilute the value of the common
stock held by its stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, OSI may be
required to significantly curtail one or more of its research and development
programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or
others that may require it to relinquish certain of OSI's rights to a number of
OSI's technologies or product candidates.

IF THE MARKET PRICE OF OSI'S COMMON STOCK, SIMILAR TO OTHER BIOTECHNOLOGY
COMPANIES, REMAINS HIGHLY VOLATILE, THEN OSI'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
SELL THEIR STOCK WHEN DESIRED OR AT DESIRABLE PRICES.

     When the stock prices of companies in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fall,
OSI's stock price will most likely fall as well. The market price of the common
stock of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and OSI's common stock has
been volatile and may remain volatile for the foreseeable future. From October
1, 2000 through September 30, 2001, the range of OSI's stock price was between
$86.38 and $30.19, and the range of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was between
$1,323.41 and $608.24. From October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002, the
range of OSI's stock price was between $50.94 and $11.50, and the range of the
Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was between $978.42 and $397.36. From October 1, 2002
through March 31, 2003, the range of OSI's stock price was between $22.74 and
$12.84, and the range of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was between $570.48 and
$442.09.

     The following factors, among others, some of which are beyond OSI's
control, may also cause OSI's stock price to decline:

     - fluctuations in operating results;

     - announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by
       others;

     - negative or neutral clinical trial results;

     - developments concerning strategic alliance agreements;

     - negative clinical or safety results from OSI's competitors' products;

     - changes in government regulation including pricing controls;

     - delays with the FDA in the approval process for Tarceva(TM) and other
       clinical candidates;

     - developments in patent or other proprietary rights;

     - public concern as to the safety of OSI's products;

     - future sales of substantial amounts of OSI's common stock by existing
       stockholders; and

     - comments by securities analysts and general market conditions.

     If OSI's stock price falls, its stockholders may not be able to sell their
stock when desired or at desirable prices.

OSI'S OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE ISSUANCE OF
CONVERTIBLE SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES IN FEBRUARY 2002, AND OSI MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO PAY THESE NOTES AND ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

     As a result of the sale of the Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes in
February 2002 and the subsequent repurchase of a portion of these notes in
August and September 2002, OSI's long-term debt relating to these notes was $160
million as of December 31, 2002 which has significantly increased OSI's interest
expense and related debt service costs. Interest payments of $3.2 million are
due and payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year at the
rate of 4% per annum. Cumulative interest payments of $41.6 million are
scheduled to be paid between January 1, 2003 and February 1, 2009. The repayment
of

$160 million of principal is scheduled to occur when the notes mature on
February 1, 2009. This long-term debt may:

     - make it more difficult for OSI to obtain any necessary financing in the
       future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
       requirements or other purposes; and

     - make OSI more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business.

     Currently, OSI does not have any product sales and it is not generating
sufficient cash flow to satisfy the annual debt service payments that is
required as a result of the consummation of the sale of the notes. This may
require OSI to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to pay
interest or borrow additional funds or sell additional equity to meet its debt
service obligations after the first three years when the payment of interest on
the notes is no longer secured. If OSI is unable to satisfy its debt service
requirements, or does not have the funds to repay the notes upon maturity in
2009, it will default on the notes and liquidity problems could result.

OSI'S GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS AND STATE LAW PROVIDE CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES
WHICH WILL DISCOURAGE A THIRD PARTY FROM SEEKING TO ACQUIRE IT AND MAY IMPEDE
THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO REMOVE AND REPLACE OSI'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND,
THEREFORE, ITS MANAGEMENT.

     OSI has had a shareholder rights plan, commonly referred to as a "poison
pill," since January 1999. The purpose of the shareholder rights plan is to
protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of OSI that
do not offer a fair price to OSI's stockholders as determined by OSI's Board of
Directors. Under the plan, the acquisition of 17.5% or more of OSI's outstanding
common stock by any person or group, unless approved by OSI's board of
directors, will trigger the right by OSI's stockholders to acquire additional
shares of OSI's common stock (and in certain cases the stock of the potential
acquiror) at a bargain purchase price, thus significantly increasing the
acquisition cost to a potential acquiror. The shareholder rights plan may have
the effect of dissuading a potential hostile acquiror from making an offer for
OSI's common stock at a price that represents a premium to the then current
trading price.

     OSI's certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain additional
anti-takeover protective devices:

     - No stockholder action may be taken without a meeting, without prior
       notice and without a vote. Solicitations by consent are thus prohibited.

     - Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by OSI's Board of
       Directors.

     - Nominations by stockholders of candidates for election to the Board of
       Directors at OSI's annual meeting of stockholders must be made at least
       45 days prior to the date on which OSI first mailed its proxy materials
       for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders.

     - The Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the
       stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences, and issue shares of,
       preferred stock. An issuance of preferred stock with dividend and
       liquidation rights senior to the common stock and convertible into a
       large number of shares of common stock could prevent a potential acquiror
       from gaining effective economic or voting control.

     Further, OSI is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts certain transactions and
business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more
of the corporation's outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from
the date the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder.

     In addition to discouraging a third party from acquiring control of OSI,
the foregoing provisions could impair the ability of existing stockholders to
remove and replace OSI's management and/or Board of Directors.

THE MARKET PRICE OF OSI'S COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

     The market price of OSI's common stock may decline as a result of the
merger for a number of reasons, including if:

     - the integration of Cell Pathways' business into OSI's existing operations
       is not completed in a timely and efficient manner;

     - OSI does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or
       to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;

     - the effect of the merger on OSI's financial results is not consistent
       with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or

     - significant stockholders of OSI or Cell Pathways decide to dispose of
       their stock following completion of the merger.

                       THE CELL PATHWAYS SPECIAL MEETING

     This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to stockholders of Cell
Pathways as of the record date as part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Cell Pathways Board of Directors for use at the special meeting called to adopt
the merger agreement.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

     Cell Pathways will hold the special meeting at           , located at
          , Pennsylvania, at   :  a.m., local time, on           ,           ,
2003.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, Cell Pathways will ask holders of Cell Pathways
common stock to adopt the merger agreement. The Cell Pathways Board of Directors
has unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, are fair to and in the best interests of Cell Pathways and
its stockholders.

     THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of Cell Pathways common stock at the close of
business on                , 2003, the record date, are entitled to notice of
and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,                shares of
Cell Pathways common stock were issued and outstanding and held by approximately
               holders of record. A quorum is present at the special meeting if
a majority of all the shares of Cell Pathways common stock issued and
outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting are
represented at the special meeting in person or by a properly executed proxy. In
the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected
that the meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.
Holders of record of Cell Pathways common stock on the record date are entitled
to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Cell Pathways common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date. Because the required vote
of Cell Pathways stockholders is based upon the number of outstanding shares of
Cell Pathways common stock, rather than upon the shares actually voted, the
failure by the holder of any such shares to submit a proxy or to vote in person
at the special meeting, including abstentions and broker non-votes, will have
the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

SHARES OWNED BY CELL PATHWAYS' DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND AFFILIATES

     At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive
officers of Cell Pathways and their affiliates beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote 572,462 shares of Cell Pathways common stock, which represented
approximately 1.45% of the shares of Cell Pathways common stock outstanding on
that date.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for
the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified
by the holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

     Shares of Cell Pathways common stock represented at the special meeting but
not voting, including shares of Cell Pathways common stock for which proxies
have been received but for which holders of shares

have abstained, will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes
of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all
business.

     Brokers who hold shares of Cell Pathways common stock in "street name" for
customers who are the beneficial owners of such shares may not give a proxy to
vote those customers' shares in the absence of specific instructions from those
customers. These non-voted shares are referred to as broker non-votes and count
as votes against the adoption of the merger agreement.

     In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the
persons named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more
adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies.
No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted
in favor of any such adjournment or postponement.

     Cell Pathways does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement will be brought before the special meeting. If,
however, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors properly presents other matters,
the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     The grant of a proxy on the enclosed form of proxy does not preclude a
stockholder from voting in person at the special meeting. A stockholder may
revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by (i) filing with the
Secretary of Cell Pathways a properly executed revocation of proxy, (ii)
submitting a properly executed proxy to the Secretary of Cell Pathways bearing a
later date or (iii) appearing at the special meeting and voting in person.
Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Cell Pathways will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and
employees of Cell Pathways may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone or
other electronic means or in person. Cell Pathways will cause brokerage houses
and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials
to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons. Cell Pathways
will reimburse such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in doing so.

     Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. will assist in the solicitation
of proxies by Cell Pathways. Cell Pathways will pay Georgeson a fee of
approximately $15,000, plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, and
will indemnify Georgeson against any losses arising out of its proxy
solicitation services on behalf of Cell Pathways.

     STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR PROXIES. A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of Cell Pathways common
stock certificates will be mailed to Cell Pathways stockholders shortly after
consummation of the merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     If the merger is consummated, holders of Cell Pathways common stock who do
not vote in favor of the merger will have the right under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law to demand appraisal of their shares. See "The
Merger and The Merger Agreement -- Appraisal or Dissenters' Rights" beginning on
page 50. Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is included in this
proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex D.

                     BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

BACKGROUND

     Since Cell Pathways began conducting business, its Board of Directors and
management have considered and explored the possibility of collaborating with
other companies in its industry in order to further its research and development
efforts and bring its products to market. In January 2001, Cell Pathways began
to place more emphasis on exploring strategic and financing alternatives,
including licensing the rights to one of its drug candidates, acquiring another
company in its industry or engaging in industry collaborations or strategic
alliances.

     During 2001, OSI's management together with its investment bankers
conducted a review of publicly available financial statements and other business
and financial information of Cell Pathways in order to determine whether a
transaction with Cell Pathways would be beneficial to OSI. OSI's management team
constantly surveys the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries for
acquisition and licensing opportunities that could complement its oncology
mission. Initial assessments of Cell Pathways and a number of other potential
acquisition candidates were made during 2001 and 2002. Following an internal
review of publicly available information regarding Cell Pathways which occurred
during the early part of 2002, OSI management determined that Cell Pathways was
a potentially good fit with OSI's strategic goals and decided to explore the
possibility of a transaction with Cell Pathways. OSI contacted Cell Pathways
during the summer of 2002 to discuss a potential transaction, and OSI and Cell
Pathways entered into a confidentiality agreement on August 5, 2002 to allow OSI
to explore a possible transaction with Cell Pathways and facilitate further
discussion.

     During the summer and fall of 2002, Cell Pathways was in contact with
various companies, including OSI, that indicated an interest in exploring a
strategic transaction with Cell Pathways. These companies engaged in discussions
with Cell Pathways' management and conducted varying degrees of due diligence.
As a result of these discussions and diligence, a number of companies declined
to proceed with discussions, but two companies, in addition to OSI, continued to
explore potential strategic transactions with Cell Pathways. Among the meetings
held by Cell Pathways was one on December 2, 2002 in Melville, New York with
representatives of OSI. In attendance at the meeting were Mr. Robert J.
Towarnicki, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cell
Pathways, Dr. Rifat Pamucku, Director, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive
Vice President of Research and Development of Cell Pathways, Dr. Pedro
Santabarbara, Vice President, Clinical Research Oncology of OSI, Dr. Arthur
Bruskin, Vice President, Strategic Planning of OSI and Dr. Geoffrey Cooper, Vice
President, Corporate Development of OSI.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors held a meeting on December 20, 2002 at
which it discussed Cell Pathways' strategic alternatives. The Cell Pathways
Board of Directors was updated on the status of discussions with companies which
had expressed interest in a possible transaction or strategic alliance with Cell
Pathways. Senior management informed the Board of Directors that one company,
Company A, submitted a non-binding indication of interest and two other
companies, OSI and Company B, were in the process of performing diligence on
Cell Pathways. The Cell Pathways Board of Directors considered and reviewed
these developments as well as the current state of financial markets and
concluded that Cell Pathways should continue its discussions with Company A and
continue to permit OSI and Company B to perform diligence on Cell Pathways. At a
further meeting on December 23, 2002, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
continued its review and consideration of strategic alternatives and appointed a
strategy committee composed of Mr. Towarnicki, Dr. Pamucku, Mr. William A.
Boeger and Mr. Paul J. Duggan to consider all matters regarding the strategic
alternatives. The Board of Directors also authorized management to continue to
explore financing alternatives.

     The strategy committee of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors held a
meeting on December 31, 2002 at which it discussed the status of discussions
with the two identified transaction candidates other than OSI. The strategy
committee was informed that Company A requested an exclusivity arrangement
whereby Cell Pathways would be required to negotiate exclusively with Company A
for a specified period regarding a strategic transaction. The strategy committee
determined that it was not advisable at that time for Cell

Pathways to grant exclusivity and concluded that management should continue to
pursue negotiations with Company A on a non-exclusive basis. The strategy
committee also was informed that OSI was scheduled to visit Cell Pathways on
January 6, 2003.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors held a meeting on January 6, 2003 and
reviewed the status of discussions with Company A and Company B. Senior
management informed the Board of Directors that negotiations continued with
Company A, that Company B continued to perform diligence but was not prepared to
submit an indication of interest at that time, and that OSI was conducting due
diligence. It was the consensus of the Board of Directors that Cell Pathways
should continue to proceed with discussions with Company A, Company B and OSI.

     On January 6, 2003, members of OSI's management team including Dr.
Santabarbara, Dr. Bruskin and Dr. Neil Gibson, Vice President, Research, met
with members of Cell Pathways' management and staff including Mr. Towarnicki,
Dr. Pamucku, Mr. Robert Bellet, a management employee of Cell Pathways, Mr.
Lloyd Glenn, a management employee of Cell Pathways, and Mr. Robert Stevenson,
internal counsel of Cell Pathways, in Cell Pathways' Horsham, Pennsylvania
offices, for the purpose of conducting a preliminary scientific evaluation of
Cell Pathways' products and technology. Following this meeting, OSI engaged
Lazard Freres & Co. LLC to provide OSI with financial advice in connection with
a potential transaction with Cell Pathways. On January 10, 2003, OSI's executive
management committee reviewed the potential for an acquisition of Cell Pathways
and determined that OSI should pursue the acquisition opportunity.

     On January 10, 2003, Company A distributed to Cell Pathways an initial
draft of a merger agreement. Throughout January, Cell Pathways and Company A
continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement. The Cell Pathways
Board of Directors was kept apprised of the progress of negotiations throughout
this period.

     On January 15, 2003, OSI presented Cell Pathways with a non-binding
indication of interest to acquire Cell Pathways through a merger. Mr. Towarnicki
spoke with Colin Goddard, Ph.D., OSI's Chief Executive Officer, and advised him
that Cell Pathways wished to consider a strategic collaboration rather than a
merger.

     From January 22, 2003 through January 24, 2003, OSI conducted a further due
diligence review of Cell Pathways' technologies, business and operations at Cell
Pathways' offices in Horsham, Pennsylvania. This diligence meeting included a
presentation to Cell Pathways' management by Dr. Goddard. During this period,
Dr. Goddard and Mr. Towarnicki discussed possible structures for a strategic
transaction between OSI and Cell Pathways. Cell Pathways also presented a
proposed term sheet to OSI for an investment in Cell Pathways and purchase of
rights in some of its products.

     On January 24, 2003, OSI withdrew its initial indication of interest and
presented Cell Pathways with a non-binding proposal to purchase specified assets
of Cell Pathways and enter into a collaboration and license agreement with Cell
Pathways. The managements of Cell Pathways and OSI began to negotiate the terms
of such a potential transaction but were unable to agree upon terms for such a
transaction.

     On January 27, 2003, Dr. Goddard and Mr. Towarnicki had further discussions
regarding potential transaction structures. Dr. Goddard explained to Mr.
Towarnicki that OSI was primarily interested in acquiring Cell Pathways through
a merger. Later that evening, Mr. Towarnicki received a revised non-binding
indication of interest from OSI providing for OSI's acquisition of Cell Pathways
through a merger.

     On January 28, 2003, Mr. Towarnicki contacted Dr. Goddard to inform him
that the valuation of Cell Pathways included in the indication of interest he
had received on January 27, 2003 was not satisfactory. Dr. Goddard indicated
that OSI would be willing to review the valuation, and Mr. Towarnicki received a
revised non-binding indication of interest later that evening that included a
revised valuation for Cell Pathways.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors held a special meeting on January 29,
2003 at which it discussed the terms of the OSI proposal and also discussed
alternatives and the status of discussions with Company A and Company B. The
Cell Pathways Board of Directors was informed that, although contact with
Company A

continued, it had not submitted a proposal to Cell Pathways which contained
specific financial terms and that negotiations with Company B remained at a very
early stage. Senior management reviewed the terms of the OSI proposal with the
Board of Directors and explained that OSI was primarily interested in acquiring
Cell Pathways through a merger. The Board of Directors was advised that it was
not possible to structure a strategic collaboration between Cell Pathways and
OSI that both parties would find acceptable and determined that it was advisable
to continue negotiations with OSI regarding a merger.

     From January 29, 2003 through February 6, 2003, Cell Pathways' and OSI's
respective managements and advisors negotiated the terms of the merger
agreement, and Cell Pathways and its legal and financial advisors conducted due
diligence on OSI, including at a meeting on January 31, 2003 at OSI's
headquarters in Melville, New York.

     A telephone conference was held in the early evening on February 3, 2003,
in which representatives of Cell Pathways' and its legal and financial advisors,
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP and CIBC World Markets, respectively, and OSI and
its legal and financial advisors, Mintz Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo,
P.C., and Lazard, respectively, participated. During this telephone conference,
Cell Pathways proposed that the exchange ratio, which was to be used to
determine the number of OSI common shares to be received in exchange for each
outstanding share of Cell Pathways common stock, be based on the average closing
price of OSI common stock just prior to consummation of the merger, which would
provide for an exchange ratio that would vary with the market price of OSI
common stock prior to consummation of the merger. OSI rejected this proposal and
instead proposed a fixed exchange ratio that would not vary prior to
consummation of the merger. After negotiation among Cell Pathways, OSI and their
respective financial advisors, it was agreed that the exchange ratio would be
fixed and would be based on an OSI common stock price of $15.00 per share, which
was approximately the average of the closing price of OSI common stock for
January 31, 2003 and February 3, 2003, which were the two trading days
immediately preceding the negotiation.

     On the evening of February 6, 2003, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
held a meeting to review the proposed transaction with OSI and to discuss
alternatives with respect to Company A and Company B. Mr. Towarnicki reviewed
with the Board of Directors the status of negotiations with OSI, the terms of
the proposed merger transaction and the status of discussions with Company A and
Company B. A representative of Morgan Lewis reviewed with the Board of Directors
the terms and provisions of the proposed merger agreement and the legal duties
and responsibilities of the directors in connection with the proposed
transaction. CIBC World Markets reviewed its financial analysis of the proposed
merger consideration and rendered to the Board of Directors an oral opinion,
which was confirmed by a written opinion dated February 6, 2003, to the effect
that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described in its
opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Cell Pathways
common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Following full consideration and discussion, a review of the principal reasons
for the merger and consideration that achieving a more favorable transaction
with Company A or Company B was unlikely, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement determining the that the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to
and in the best interests of Cell Pathways and its stockholders. The reasons for
the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' approval are summarized below.

     The OSI Board of Directors held a meeting on February 7, 2003, at which
representatives from Lazard, Mintz Levin and Saul Ewing LLP, OSI's securities
counsel, participated. Several members of management including Dr. Goddard, Dr.
Bruskin, and Ms. Barbara Wood, OSI's General Counsel, made presentations as to
various aspects of Cell Pathways and the proposed transaction to the Board of
Directors of OSI. Lazard also discussed the proposed transaction with the OSI
Board of Directors. After these presentations by OSI's management and
discussion, OSI's Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger and
authorized the officers of OSI to finalize and execute the merger agreement.
Immediately following the OSI Board of Directors meeting, the Board of Directors
of CP Merger Corporation met and unanimously approved the merger and authorized
its officers to finalize and execute the merger agreement.

     On the evening of February 7, 2003, OSI, CP Merger Corporation and Cell
Pathways executed a definitive merger agreement. On February 10, 2003, each of
Cell Pathways and OSI issued a press release announcing the merger agreement.

THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the
Cell Pathways Board of Directors considered and reviewed with Cell Pathways'
senior management and outside advisors a number of factors relevant to the
merger, including Cell Pathways' strategic business plans, its financial
position and potential for raising additional funds, its products and research
and development portfolio and its commercial operations.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors also considered the following factors:

     - Cell Pathways' present financial condition and difficulty in raising
       additional capital to meet its ongoing commitments as well as its drug
       development goals and the view of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
       that the merger will provide greater opportunities and resources for Cell
       Pathways' drug development programs;

     - Cell Pathways' inability to meet the continued listing requirements of
       the Nasdaq National Market and the negative effect delisting would have
       on the liquidity of the Cell Pathways common stock and any future efforts
       by Cell Pathways to raise additional capital;

     - the greater ability of OSI to fund research and development of Cell
       Pathways' products as a result of OSI's cash position relative to Cell
       Pathways' cash position;

     - Cell Pathways' difficulties in competing against larger companies with
       greater resources and the advantages of the merger in light of OSI's
       greater financial resources;

     - the fact that the merger will allow Cell Pathways stockholders to receive
       an equity interest in OSI, and thereby participate in the potential
       success of Cell Pathways' products;

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' view that the combination of the
       businesses of Cell Pathways and OSI will result in an organization with
       greater financial, technical and other resources than Cell Pathways could
       provide as a stand-alone entity, and will allow for a significant
       acceleration in the commercial success of Cell Pathways products and
       technologies;

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' view that OSI will provide greater
       resources and opportunities for Cell Pathways technology and product
       development programs;

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' assessment of the strengths of OSI
       and its research and development staffs and the positive effect such
       strengths may have on the clinical development of Cell Pathways' drug
       candidates;

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' assessment of Cell Pathways'
       strategic alternatives and its view that the merger presented more
       attractive opportunities than remaining as an independent company;

     - the results of the process that had been conducted by Cell Pathways to
       evaluate strategic alternatives, and in particular, the difficulties Cell
       Pathways encountered in exploring financing alternatives and strategic
       collaborations and the substantial additional funds required to continue
       Cell Pathways' operations if it remained an independent company;

     - information regarding historical market prices and other information with
       respect to Cell Pathways common stock, and the financial performance and
       condition, assets, liabilities, business operations and prospects of each
       of OSI and Cell Pathways;

     - the financial presentation of CIBC World Markets, including its opinion
       dated February 6, 2003, to the Cell Pathways Board of Directors as to the
       fairness, from a financial point of view and as of that date, of the
       merger consideration to be received by holders of Cell Pathways common
       stock, as described below under the heading "Opinion of Cell Pathways'
       Financial Advisor";

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors' assessment of the value of shares
       of OSI common stock to be received by Cell Pathways stockholders in the
       merger and the premium represented thereby over various historical prices
       for Cell Pathways common stock;

     - a comparison of selected recent acquisition and merger transactions in
       the industry as well as the trading performance for comparable companies
       in the industry;

     - the likelihood that the merger will be consummated, and the terms and
       conditions of the merger agreement, including that the break-up fee
       payable in specific circumstances set forth in the merger agreement is
       reasonable, taking into account the other terms of the transaction and
       the range of commercially reasonable break-up fees for a transaction of
       this size;

     - the expected tax treatment of the merger; and

     - reports from the Cell Pathways management and advisors as to the results
       of their review of OSI's business.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors also considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following material factors:

     - the risk that the benefits sought to be achieved in the merger will not
       be realized due to OSI not successfully integrating or assimilating the
       Cell Pathways business into its own business;

     - the loss of control over the future operations and the inability of Cell
       Pathways' Board of Directors, management and stockholders to direct the
       future clinical development of Cell Pathways' drug candidates;

     - the fixed nature of the exchange ratio and the resulting risk that,
       should there be a decrease in the market value of OSI common stock, the
       value of the consideration to be received by the Cell Pathways
       stockholders in the merger would be reduced; and

     - the fact that Cell Pathways would be foregoing other potential
       opportunities by entering into the merger agreement and the possibility
       that, if the merger is not completed, Cell Pathways will not have
       sufficient financing or a collaboration arrangement in place.

     The Cell Pathways Board of Directors believes that these potentially
negative factors are outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     This summary is not meant to be an exhaustive description of the
information and factors considered by the Cell Pathways Board of Directors but
includes all material factors considered. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by the Cell Pathways Board of Directors, it was not possible to
quantify or to give relative weights to the various factors. After taking into
consideration all the factors set forth above, as well as other factors not
specifically described above, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors approved the
merger and the merger agreement because of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors'
belief that the merger is advisable to Cell Pathways and its stockholders.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After careful consideration, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors has
unanimously determined that the merger agreement, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, are fair to and in the best interests of Cell Pathways and
its stockholders. THE CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF CELL PATHWAYS' FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Cell Pathways engaged CIBC World Markets to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger. In connection with this engagement, the Board of
Directors of Cell Pathways requested that CIBC World Markets evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Cell Pathways common
stock of the merger consideration. On February 6, 2003, at a meeting of the
Board of Directors held to

evaluate the merger, CIBC World Markets rendered an oral opinion, which was
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion to the Cell Pathways Board of
Directors dated the same date, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to the matters described in the opinion, the merger consideration
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Cell Pathways common
stock.

     The full text of CIBC World Markets' written opinion, dated February 6,
2003, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex C. CIBC WORLD MARKETS' OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE
CELL PATHWAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW. THE OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY
OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW
ANY STOCKHOLDER SHOULD VOTE OR ACT WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE
MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CIBC WORLD MARKETS' OPINION DESCRIBED BELOW IS QUALIFIED
IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF ITS OPINION. HOLDERS OF CELL
PATHWAYS COMMON STOCK ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ THE OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

     In arriving at its opinion, CIBC World Markets:

     - reviewed a draft dated February 6, 2003 of the merger agreement and form
       of contingent value rights agreement attached as an exhibit to the merger
       agreement;

     - reviewed audited financial statements of Cell Pathways for the fiscal
       years ended December 31, 1999, December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001
       and audited financial statements of OSI for the fiscal years ended
       September 30, 2000, September 30, 2001 and September 30, 2002;

     - reviewed unaudited financial statements of Cell Pathways for the fiscal
       year ended December 31, 2002 and discussed with OSI's management
       estimated financial results for OSI for the three-month period from
       September 30, 2002 through December 31, 2002;

     - reviewed financial forecasts relating to Cell Pathways and OSI prepared
       by Cell Pathways' management and discussed with CIBC World Markets by the
       managements of Cell Pathways and OSI;

     - reviewed historical market prices and trading volume for Cell Pathways
       common stock and OSI common stock;

     - held discussions with senior managements of Cell Pathways and OSI with
       respect to the businesses and prospects of Cell Pathways and OSI,
       including, in the case of Cell Pathways, the liquidity needs of, and
       capital resources available to, Cell Pathways and the potential strategic
       and operational benefits to Cell Pathways of the merger;

     - contacted, at Cell Pathways' direction, selected third parties to solicit
       indications of interest in a possible acquisition of or investment in
       Cell Pathways and held discussions with Cell Pathways' management as to
       the results of its solicitation of third parties regarding a possible
       acquisition of or investment in Cell Pathways and exploration of other
       strategic and financial alternatives (for more information regarding Cell
       Pathways' consideration of third-party indications of interest and
       strategic and financial alternatives, see "Background and Reasons for the
       Merger -- Background" beginning on page 26);

     - reviewed and analyzed publicly available financial data for selected
       companies that CIBC World Markets deemed comparable to Cell Pathways and
       OSI;

     - reviewed the premiums paid, based on publicly available information, in
       transactions with transaction values comparable to the merger;

     - analyzed Cell Pathways' estimated liquidation value using assumptions and
       estimates provided to or discussed with CIBC World Markets by Cell
       Pathways' management as to the current market value of Cell Pathways'
       assets and the amount of Cell Pathways' liabilities;

     - analyzed the estimated present value of the unlevered, after-tax free
       cash flows and estimated present value of the future trading price of OSI
       common stock using financial forecasts, including assumptions

       of future performance contained in those forecasts, prepared by Cell
       Pathways' management and discussed with CIBC World Markets by the
       managements of Cell Pathways and OSI;

     - reviewed potential pro forma financial effects of the merger on OSI based
       on financial forecasts prepared by Cell Pathways' management and
       discussed with CIBC World Markets by the managements of Cell Pathways and
       OSI;

     - reviewed public information concerning Cell Pathways and OSI; and

     - performed other analyses and reviewed other information as CIBC World
       Markets deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets relied on and assumed, without
independent verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial and other information provided to or discussed with it by Cell
Pathways, OSI and their respective employees, representatives and affiliates.
With respect to financial forecasts relating to Cell Pathways and OSI which were
prepared by Cell Pathways' management and discussed with CIBC World Markets by
the managements of Cell Pathways and OSI, CIBC World Markets assumed, at the
direction of Cell Pathways' management, without independent verification or
investigation, that the financial forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best available information, estimates and judgments of Cell
Pathways' management as to the future financial condition and operating results
of Cell Pathways and OSI and the other matters covered by those forecasts. CIBC
World Markets relied, at the direction of the managements of Cell Pathways and
OSI, without independent verification or investigation, upon the assessments of
the managements of Cell Pathways and OSI as to the existing and future
technology and product candidates of Cell Pathways and OSI and the risks
associated with such technology and product candidates. CIBC World Markets also
relied, at the direction of Cell Pathways' management, without independent
verification or investigation, upon the assessments of Cell Pathways' management
as to the probability that the future financial results reflected in the
financial forecasts prepared by Cell Pathways' management relating to Cell
Pathways and OSI, including the estimated revenue expected to be generated from
product candidates of Cell Pathways and OSI, will be realized as well as to the
amount and timing of those future financial results if realized. CIBC World
Markets assumed, with Cell Pathways' consent, that the merger would be treated
as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes. CIBC World Markets also
assumed, with Cell Pathways' consent, that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or third party consents and approvals for the merger, no
limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed that would have an
adverse effect on Cell Pathways, OSI or the contemplated benefits of the merger.
In addition, representatives of Cell Pathways advised CIBC World Markets, and
CIBC World Markets therefore assumed, that the final terms of the merger
agreement and the contingent value rights agreement attached as an exhibit to
the merger agreement will not vary materially from those set forth in the draft
of those documents reviewed by CIBC World Markets.

     CIBC World Markets did not make or obtain any independent evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Cell
Pathways or OSI. CIBC World Markets expressed no opinion as to Cell Pathways' or
OSI's underlying valuation, future performance or long-term viability, or the
prices at which Cell Pathways common stock, OSI common stock or the contingent
value rights would trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. CIBC World
Markets expressed no view as to, and its opinion does not address, Cell
Pathways' underlying business decision to effect the merger, and its opinion
also does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might exist for Cell Pathways or the effect
of any other transaction in which Cell Pathways might engage. CIBC World
Markets' opinion was necessarily based on the information available to CIBC
World Markets and general economic, financial and stock market conditions and
circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by CIBC World Markets as of
the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, CIBC World Markets does not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. Except as described above, Cell Pathways imposed no other
instructions or limitations on CIBC World Markets with respect to the
investigations made or the procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.

     This summary is not a complete description of CIBC World Markets' opinion
or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by CIBC World Markets
in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. CIBC World Markets
believes that its analyses and this summary must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the
narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the processes underlying CIBC World Markets' analyses and opinion.

     In performing its analyses, CIBC World Markets considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond
Cell Pathways' and OSI's control. No company, transaction or business used in
the analyses as a comparison is identical to Cell Pathways, OSI or the merger,
and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments
or transactions analyzed.

     The estimates contained in CIBC World Markets' analyses and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating
to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Accordingly, CIBC World Markets' analyses and estimates are inherently subject
to substantial uncertainty.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined
through negotiation between Cell Pathways and OSI and the decision to enter into
the merger was solely that of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors. CIBC World
Markets' opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Cell Pathways
Board of Directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors or management
with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
CIBC World Markets' opinion delivered to the Cell Pathways Board of Directors in
connection with the merger. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE
INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND CIBC WORLD
MARKETS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF
EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE
FINANCIAL ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING
THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE
METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING
OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF CIBC WORLD MARKETS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES. For purposes of
the summary of CIBC World Markets' analyses, the term "implied per share merger
consideration range" refers to the estimated implied per share value range of
the merger consideration based on the per share price of OSI common stock on
February 5, 2003, the upper end of which assumes the occurrence of either of the
milestones which would result in the conversion of each contingent value right
into an additional 0.04 of a share of OSI common stock and the lower end of
which is based solely on the exchange ratio assuming that neither of those
milestones occurs.

  CELL PATHWAYS ANALYSES

     Selected Companies Analysis.  CIBC World Markets compared financial and
stock market information for Cell Pathways and the 10 selected publicly held
companies listed below. These selected companies were chosen for comparison with
Cell Pathways because, as is the case with Cell Pathways, these companies
operate in the biotechnology industry and have one or more of the following
characteristics: (i) a therapeutic focus generally comparable to that of Cell
Pathways, (ii) compounds which received adverse results in clinical trials, were
the subject of negative announcements from development and commercialization
partners or were

denied approval by the FDA, and/or (iii) market and financial characteristics
generally comparable to those of Cell Pathways.

     - EntreMed, Inc.

     - Genzyme Molecular Oncology

     - ImmunoGen, Inc.

     - Maxim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     - NeoPharm, Inc.

     - Praecis Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

     - Seattle Genetics, Inc.

     - SuperGen, Inc.

     - Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     - Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     CIBC World Markets reviewed technology values, calculated as equity value
plus debt, minority interests, preferred stock and out-of-the-money convertible
securities, less cash and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. CIBC World
Markets then utilized a range of selected technology values derived from the
selected companies in order to derive an implied per share equity reference
range for Cell Pathways. Technology values were based on closing stock prices on
February 5, 2003. Estimated financial data for Cell Pathways were based on
internal estimates of Cell Pathways' management. This analysis indicated the
following implied per share equity reference range for Cell Pathways, as
compared to the implied per share merger consideration range:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                            IMPLIED PER SHARE
      REFERENCE RANGE FOR CELL PATHWAYS                  MERGER CONSIDERATION RANGE
      ---------------------------------                  --------------------------

                 $0.39-$0.44                                     $0.82-$1.39

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  CIBC World Markets reviewed the premiums paid in
32 selected merger or acquisition transactions announced since February 5, 2001
having transaction values ranging from $20 million to $50 million. These
selected transactions were chosen for comparison with the proposed merger
because the transaction value range of the selected transactions is comparable
to the transaction value of the merger based on the closing price of OSI common
stock on February 5, 2003. CIBC World Markets also reviewed the premiums paid in
28 selected merger or acquisition transactions announced since February 5, 1999
in the biotechnology industry, which is the industry in which Cell Pathways and
OSI operate. CIBC World Markets then applied a range of selected premiums
derived from these transactions based on the average closing stock prices of the
target company for the one day, one week and four week periods prior to public
announcement of the transaction to the average closing price of Cell Pathways
common stock for the one day, one week and four week periods ended February 5,
2003. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity reference
range for Cell Pathways, as compared to the implied per share merger
consideration range:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                            IMPLIED PER SHARE
      REFERENCE RANGE FOR CELL PATHWAYS                  MERGER CONSIDERATION RANGE
      ---------------------------------                  --------------------------

                 $0.56-$0.76                                     $0.82-$1.39

     Liquidation Analysis.  CIBC World Markets performed a liquidation analysis
of Cell Pathways to estimate the potential range of proceeds available for
distribution upon a liquidation of Cell Pathways. Financial data for this
analysis were based on internal estimates of Cell Pathways' management as to the
estimated market value of Cell Pathways' assets as of December 31, 2002, the
percentages of estimated market value of those assets which Cell Pathways'
management believed could be realized in a liquidation and the amount of Cell
Pathways' liabilities as of December 31, 2002 without giving effect to potential
incremental expenditures incurred pending a liquidation and severance, legal and
other expenses associated with a

liquidation. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity
reference range for Cell Pathways, as compared to the implied per share merger
consideration range:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                            IMPLIED PER SHARE
      REFERENCE RANGE FOR CELL PATHWAYS                  MERGER CONSIDERATION RANGE
      ---------------------------------                  --------------------------

                 $0.23-$0.27                                     $0.82-$1.39

  OSI ANALYSES

     Selected Companies Analysis.  CIBC World Markets compared financial and
stock market information for OSI and the seven selected publicly held companies
listed below. These selected companies were chosen for comparison with OSI
because, as is the case with OSI, these companies operate in the biotechnology
industry and have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) a
therapeutic focus generally comparable to that of OSI, (ii) marketed compounds
or late stage compounds generally in Phase III trials, and/or (iii) market and
financial characteristics generally comparable to those of OSI.

     - Allos Therapeutics, Inc.

     - Celgene Corporation

     - Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

     - Enzon, Inc.

     - ILEX Oncology, Inc.

     - Immunomedics, Inc.

     - Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

     CIBC World Markets reviewed technology values and technology values as a
multiple of estimated calendar year 2003 and 2004 revenue. CIBC World Markets
then utilized a range of selected technology values derived from the selected
companies and applied selected multiples of estimated calendar year 2003 and
2004 revenue derived from the selected companies to corresponding financial data
of OSI in order to derive an implied per share equity reference range for OSI.
Technology values were based on closing stock prices on February 5, 2003.
Estimated financial data for the selected companies were based on publicly
available research analysts' estimates, and estimated financial data for OSI
were based on internal estimates prepared by Cell Pathways' management after
discussion with OSI's management. This analysis indicated the following implied
per share equity reference range for OSI, as compared to the per share price of
OSI common stock on February 5, 2003:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                   PER SHARE PRICE OF OSI COMMON STOCK
           REFERENCE RANGE FOR OSI                           ON FEBRUARY 5, 2003
          ------------------------                   -----------------------------------

                $12.05-$13.78                                      $14.40

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  CIBC World Markets performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of OSI to calculate the estimated present value of the
unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that OSI could generate for fiscal years
2004 through 2007. Estimated financial data for OSI were based on internal
estimates prepared by Cell Pathways' management after discussion with OSI's
management, which estimates took into account, among other things, the
probability that particular product candidates being developed by OSI would be
commercialized. CIBC World Markets calculated a range of estimated terminal
values by applying terminal value revenue multiples ranging from 4.0x to 5.0x to
OSI's projected fiscal year 2007 revenue. The present value of the cash flows
and terminal values were calculated using a discount rate of 20.0%. This
analysis indicated the following implied per share equity reference range for
OSI, as compared to the per share price of OSI common stock on February 5, 2003:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                   PER SHARE PRICE OF OSI COMMON STOCK
           REFERENCE RANGE FOR OSI                           ON FEBRUARY 5, 2003
          ------------------------                   -----------------------------------

                $17.10-$19.88                                      $14.40

     Discounted Trading Price Analysis.  CIBC World Markets performed a
discounted trading price analysis of OSI to calculate the estimated present
value of hypothetical prices at which OSI common stock could trade in calendar
year 2007. Estimated financial data for OSI were based on internal estimates
prepared by Cell Pathways' management after discussion with OSI's management,
which estimates took into account, among other things, the probability that
particular product candidates being developed by OSI would be commercialized.
CIBC World Markets calculated a range of implied hypothetical future trading
prices for OSI common stock by applying one-year forward earnings per share
multiples of 25.0x to 30.0x to OSI's projected calendar year 2007 earnings per
share. The present value of the implied hypothetical future trading prices was
calculated using a discount rate of 20.0%. This analysis indicated the following
implied per share equity reference range for OSI, as compared to the per share
price of OSI common stock on February 5, 2003:

          IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                   PER SHARE PRICE OF OSI COMMON STOCK
           REFERENCE RANGE FOR OSI                           ON FEBRUARY 5, 2003
          ------------------------                   -----------------------------------

                $24.39-$29.26                                      $14.40

  OTHER FACTORS

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets also reviewed and considered
other factors, including the following:

     - trading volumes of Cell Pathways common stock and OSI common stock at
       various historical price ranges, as a percentage of public float, defined
       as total outstanding shares of common stock excluding shares owned by
       directors, officers and 5% institutional holders;

     - the relationship between movements in Cell Pathways common stock and OSI
       common stock, movements in the AMEX Biotechnology Index and movements in
       the Standard and Poor's MidCap 400 Stock Price Index;

     - trading multiples of selected publicly traded companies in the specialty
       pharmaceuticals industry and selected publicly traded companies having
       market capitalizations in excess of $1.8 billion in the biotechnology
       industry;

     - the ratio of the per share closing prices of Cell Pathways common stock
       and OSI common stock on February 5, 2003 and the average of this ratio
       calculated over various periods ended February 5, 2003;

     - the potential pro forma effect of the merger on OSI's estimated earnings
       per share in fiscal years 2004 through 2008; and

     - selected research analysts' reports for OSI, including stock price and
       earnings per share estimates reflected in those reports.

  MISCELLANEOUS

     Cell Pathways has agreed to pay CIBC World Markets for its financial
advisory services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of
approximately $1.1 million, approximately $800,000 of which is contingent upon
completion of the merger. In addition, Cell Pathways has agreed to reimburse
CIBC World Markets for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify CIBC World
Markets and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws, relating to, or arising out of, its engagement. In the
ordinary course of business, CIBC World Markets and its affiliates may actively
trade securities of Cell Pathways and OSI for their own account and for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in those securities.

     Cell Pathways selected CIBC World Markets as its financial advisor based on
CIBC World Markets' reputation, experience and familiarity with Cell Pathways.
CIBC World Markets is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and,
as a customary part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in
valuations of businesses and securities in connection with acquisitions and
mergers, underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private
placements and valuations for other purposes.

OSI'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In evaluating the merger, the OSI Board of Directors reviewed presentations
from management and held discussions with its financial advisor, Lazard. In
reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the
OSI Board of Directors considered the following factors in favor of the merger:

     - the quality of Cell Pathways' technology platform and the potential for
       its clinical candidates, which may enhance OSI's ability to produce
       effective therapies for cancer;

     - the expansion of OSI's product pipeline by adding Cell Pathways' product
       pipeline, which includes one product candidate in Phase III clinical
       trials and one product candidate in Phase II clinical trials; and

     - the addition of a marketed product in Gelclair(TM).

     The OSI Board of Directors weighed these advantages against potential risks
of the merger. The following summarizes potentially negative factors considered
by the OSI Board of Directors:

     - As with most mergers, there is a risk that anticipated benefits will not
       be realized; for example, OSI may encounter difficulties integrating Cell
       Pathways' business.

     - There is inherent uncertainty in developing and commercializing
       pharmaceutical products.

     The OSI Board of Directors believes these potentially negative factors are
outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     After considering the potential positive and negative factors of the
merger, the OSI Board of Directors did not attempt to quantify or prioritize
particular considerations. Ultimately, the OSI Board of Directors unanimously
concluded that the merger should provide significant long-term benefits to OSI's
stockholders; consequently, the Board of Directors approved the merger
agreement.

INTERESTS OF CELL PATHWAYS' DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
with respect to adopting the merger agreement, you should be aware that the
directors and officers of Cell Pathways have interests in the merger and
participate in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to,
those of Cell Pathways stockholders generally. The Cell Pathways Board of
Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters,
in approving the merger agreement. These include:

  CONSULTING ARRANGEMENTS

     Robert J. Towarnicki, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Cell Pathways, Brian J. Hayden, Chief Financial Officer of Cell Pathways, and
Rifat Pamucku, M.D., Director, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Vice
President of Research and Development of Cell Pathways, will each enter into a
consulting agreement with OSI upon consummation of the merger.

     Mr. Towarnicki and Mr. Hayden will receive consulting agreements with OSI
to facilitate the interim management of Cell Pathways' operations and the
transition, integration, and transfer of Cell Pathways' assets to OSI. The term
of each consulting agreement will be 18 months beginning on the effective date
of the merger. In consideration for this commitment, OSI has agreed to pay Mr.
Towarnicki $200,000 and Mr. Hayden $150,000. In addition, and following the
successful transition of assets to OSI, due consideration will be given to the
forgiveness of loans from Cell Pathways to Mr. Towarnicki and Mr. Hayden that
currently have principal and interest outstanding in the amounts of
approximately $553,000 for Mr. Towarnicki and $509,000 for Mr. Hayden.

     Dr. Pamukcu will receive a consulting agreement for a term of three years
beginning on the effective date of the merger. In consideration of this
commitment, OSI has agreed to pay Dr. Pamukcu $20,000 per month for the first
8-10 months (i.e., the period through completion of the Phase II trial of CP461
in the inflammatory bowel disorder), $10,000 per month for the next 2-4 months
(i.e., the period through the end of the first year of the term) of the
consulting agreement and $5,000 per month for the second and third years of

the term of the consulting agreement. In connection with his execution and
delivery of the consulting agreement, OSI will also pay to Dr. Pamukcu either
(i) 8,000 shares of OSI common stock plus a cash payment equal to all taxes
payable by Dr. Pamukcu with respect to the issuance of such common stock or (ii)
the cash equivalent of the current value of 8,000 shares of OSI common stock
plus an additional cash payment equal to all taxes payable by Dr. Pamukcu with
respect to the cash payment.

  ACCELERATED VESTING OF OPTIONS

     All outstanding options to purchase Cell Pathways' stock held by a
director, officer or employee of Cell Pathways that are unvested as of the date
that the stockholders adopt the merger agreement will accelerate in full and be
immediately vested and exercisable. On March 5, 2003, options to purchase
1,832,573 shares of Cell Pathways stock were held by directors and officers of
Cell Pathways with an weighted average exercise price per share of $7.81.

 CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS

     Robert J. Towarnicki, Brian J. Hayden, Rifat Pamukcu, M.D., Lloyd Glenn and
Robert Bellet, M.D., each an executive officer of Cell Pathways, have entered
into change of control agreements with Cell Pathways that provide for the
benefits below in the event they are terminated by OSI without cause or they
terminate their employment for good reason following a change of control.

     Mr. Towarnicki is entitled to:

     - a cash payment equal to his unpaid annual base salary earned through his
       date of termination and a pro-rated amount of the annual incentive bonus
       that he would have received for the year of his termination;

     - a cash payment equal to three times the sum of his annual base salary in
       effect prior to the change of control and his annual incentive bonus;

     - a cash payment equal to the after-tax cost of continued medical and
       dental coverage for Mr. Towarnicki and his spouse and dependents for the
       three year period following Mr. Towarnicki's termination of employment;
       and

     - outplacement assistance services for a period of twelve months following
       Mr. Towarnicki's termination of employment at a cost not to exceed
       $10,000.

     Messrs. Hayden and Glenn and Drs. Pamukcu and Bellet are each entitled to:

     - a cash payment equal to such executive's unpaid annual base salary earned
       through such executive's date of termination and a pro-rated amount of
       the annual incentive bonus that such executive would have received for
       the year of such executive's termination;

     - a cash payment equal to two times the sum of such executive's annual base
       salary in effect prior to the change of control and such executive's
       annual incentive bonus;

     - a cash payment equal to the after-tax cost of continued medical and
       dental coverage for such executive and his spouse and dependents for the
       two-year period following such executive's termination of employment; and

     - outplacement assistance services for a period of twelve months following
       such executive's termination of employment at a cost not to exceed
       $10,000.

     If any of the payments described above would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code, as amended, the executive shall also receive an additional cash payment
equal to the amount of any taxes levied pursuant to Section 280G plus an
additional cash payment equal to all taxes payable by the executive with respect
to the cash payment.

 INDEMNIFICATION

     The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the merger existing in favor of present and former officers,
directors and employees of Cell Pathways under Cell Pathways' certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or any applicable contract or agreement in effect on the
date of the merger agreement, will be assumed by OSI for a period of six years
after the date of the merger agreement. In addition, a "tail" policy under Cell
Pathways' existing directors' and officers' insurance policies will be purchased
that (i) has an effective term of six years from the effective time of the
merger, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered, or will be covered
on or prior to the effective time of the merger, by Cell Pathways' directors'
and officers' insurance policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the effective time of the
merger and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including, without limitation,
coverage amounts) that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate as the
terms and conditions of Cell Pathways' directors' and officers' insurance
policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement. The term of the coverage
of the "tail" policy may be reduced, if necessary, to a term of coverage that
can be obtained for a premium equal to $1,562,500 plus any unearned premium
actually refunded or credited to Cell Pathways with respect to Cell Pathways'
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies.

                      THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of significant provisions of the merger
agreement. For a more complete understanding of the merger agreement, you should
read the agreement. The agreement is attached hereto as Annex A and is
incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

     In the merger, CP Merger Corporation, a specially formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary of OSI, will merge with and into Cell Pathways. Cell Pathways will be
the surviving corporation and will continue to exist under Delaware law as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI. The by-laws of the specially formed,
wholly-owned subsidiary, as in effect immediately before the merger, will be the
by-laws of the surviving company. At the effective time of the merger, the
certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended so as
to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, of the certificate of
incorporation of the specially formed, wholly-owned subsidiary as in effect
immediately before the merger, and accordingly, the name of the surviving
corporation will be CP Merger Corporation.

EFFECTIVE TIME

     The merger will close as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement. The merger will be
effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State. The closing date is expected to be on or about           , 2003.

MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR CELL PATHWAYS' COMMON STOCK AND EXCHANGE RATIOS

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Cell
Pathways common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.0567 of a
share of OSI common stock.

     Each holder of Cell Pathways common stock will also receive one contingent
value right for each share of Cell Pathways stock he, she or it holds. Each
contingent value right represents the right to receive 0.04 shares of OSI common
stock upon the earlier to occur of (i) the filing of an NDA (i.e., accepted for
filing) with the FDA for marketing in the United States of Aptosyn(R)
(exisulind) for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in
combination with Taxotere(R) on the basis of the registration trial currently
underway, (ii) the filing of an NDA (i.e., accepted for filing) with the FDA for
marketing of CP461 in the United States for the treatment of any indication or
(iii) a determination by OSI, in its sole discretion, that the contingent value
rights should convert into OSI common stock, provided such milestone event
occurs on or prior to the date that is five years after consummation of the
merger. If none of these milestone events has occurred prior to such date, the
contingent value rights will terminate. The contingent value rights are not
transferable.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

     OSI will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Instead, OSI will pay
cash to each Cell Pathways stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to
receive a fractional share of OSI common stock. The cash amount for the shares
of OSI common stock to be issued at the closing of the merger will equal the
fractional share number multiplied by $15.00.

     The cash amount for the shares of OSI common stock to be issued pursuant to
the contingent value right, if any, will equal the fractional share number
multiplied by the per share closing price of OSI common stock as reported by the
Nasdaq National Market on the trading day on which the milestone event occurs.

EXCHANGE OF CELL PATHWAYS' STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Promptly after the effective time, OSI will cause the exchange agent
designated by OSI to mail transmittal forms to each person who held shares of
Cell Pathways common stock as of the effective time for use in exchanging Cell
Pathways stock certificates for OSI common stock certificates, cash for
fractional shares, and contingent value right certificates. The transmittal
forms will include instructions specifying details of the exchange.

     If a milestone is achieved, OSI or the rights agent, Bank of New York, will
promptly mail transmittal forms to each person who held contingent value right
certificates as of the date such milestone is achieved for use in exchanging the
contingent value right certificates for OSI common stock certificates and any
cash for fractional shares. The transmittal forms will include instructions
specifying details of the exchange.

     DO NOT SEND IN YOUR CELL PATHWAYS STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A
     TRANSMITTAL FORM.

     If certificates for any shares of Cell Pathways common stock have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder must submit appropriate evidence regarding
the ownership, loss, theft or destruction of the certificate, an affidavit to
that effect and a customary indemnification agreement to the exchange agent.

     OSI will honor a request from a person surrendering a Cell Pathways common
stock certificate that the OSI common stock being given in exchange be issued to
a person other than the registered holder of the certificate on the exchange
agent's books, so long as the requesting person:

     - submits all documents necessary to evidence and effect the transfer to
       the new holder; and

     - pays any transfer or other taxes for issuing shares of OSI common stock
       to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate, unless
       the requesting person satisfactorily establishes to OSI that any tax has
       been paid or is inapplicable.

     Holders of Cell Pathways common stock exchanged for OSI common stock in the
merger will be entitled to receive dividends and other distributions on OSI
common stock (without interest) that are declared or made with a record date
after the effective time. Dividends or other distributions will not be paid to
any former holder of Cell Pathways common stock, however, until that holder
surrenders its shares of Cell Pathways stock to the exchange agent.

TREATMENT OF CELL PATHWAYS' STOCK OPTIONS, EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND
WARRANTS

 OPTIONS

     Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Cell Pathways common stock
under the Cell Pathways 1997 Equity Incentive Plan, 1997 Non-Employee Directors'
Stock Option Plan and 1995 Stock Award Plan that is unvested as of the date that
the Cell Pathways stockholders adopt the merger agreement will accelerate in
full and be immediately vested and exercisable. Any options that are not
exercised prior to the effective time of the merger, will terminate in
accordance with the terms of the various Cell Pathways option plans. Prior to
the effective time of the merger, the participants under each of the plans will
be given any required notice regarding the accelerated vesting and the
cancellation of such plan.

 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Before the effective time of the merger, Cell Pathways will give the
required notice of the cancellation of the Cell Pathways Employee Stock Purchase
Plan to participants and each such participant will have the right to exercise
his or her outstanding option under such plan in full based on accumulated
payroll deductions credited to his or her account. After the effective time of
the merger, no new payroll contributions will be accepted and any cash remaining
in a participant's account will be distributed to such participant without
interest.

 WARRANTS

     At the effective time of the merger, OSI will assume each outstanding and
unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Cell Pathways stock, which in the
aggregate are exercisable for 778,249 shares of Cell Pathways common stock with
a weighted average exercise price per share of $3.85. Each assumed warrant will
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the respective Cell Pathways warrant, except that:

     - each warrant will be exercisable for (i) a number of shares of OSI common
       stock equal to the number of shares of Cell Pathways stock that were
       issuable upon exercise of the warrant immediately before

       the effective time multiplied by 0.0567, and (ii) either (A) if exercised
       prior to the date a milestone is achieved (but not after the date
       occurring five years after consummation of the merger), that number of
       contingent value rights equal to the number of shares of Cell Pathways
       common stock subject to the warrant or (B) if exercised after a milestone
       is achieved (provided such milestone was achieved prior to the date
       occurring five years after the effective time of the merger), that number
       of shares of OSI common stock that would have been issued, if any, had
       the holder of the warrant had contingent value rights on the date the
       milestone was achieved; and

     - the per share exercise price for the OSI common stock issuable upon
       exercise of an assumed warrant will be equal to the price per share of
       Cell Pathways stock at which the warrant was exercisable immediately
       before the effective time divided by 0.0567.

TREATMENT OF CELL PATHWAYS BENEFITS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND OTHER EMPLOYEE
MATTERS

     For a period of nine months after the effective time, OSI will give Cell
Pathways' employees who continue their employment after the merger,
compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated
employees of OSI or to those provided by Cell Pathways prior to the effective
time, or a combination of both, such that the compensation, employee benefits
and terms and conditions of employment are substantially similar to those of
Cell Pathways as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger. In addition, such employees will receive service credit for eligibility
and vesting (but not benefit accrual) for employment, compensation and employee
benefit purposes, except as would result in duplication of benefits or payments.
OSI has also agreed to waive limitations for preexisting condition exclusions
and waiting periods under any OSI welfare benefit plans that a continuing Cell
Pathways employee is eligible to participate in after the merger. This waiver
would not include, however, limitations and waiting periods that have not been
satisfied by an employee under any Cell Pathways welfare plan prior to the
merger. Continuing Cell Pathways employees will also receive credit for their
accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the effective time
of the merger.

     All Cell Pathways' employment, change of control and other compensation
agreements existing prior to execution of the merger agreement will be assumed
and honored by OSI.

     After consummation of the merger, OSI shall determine whether to continue,
terminate, merge, modify or amend any employee benefit plan or arrangement
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Cell Pathways including, without
limitation, the Cell Pathways Retirement Savings Plan, and any such action shall
be carried out in accordance with applicable law and in accordance with the
terms of any such plan.

     Prior to the effective time, Cell Pathways will distribute an aggregate
amount of $250,000 to its employees, other than employees who have entered into
a change of control agreement with Cell Pathways. The $250,000 will be allocated
between all such employees in amounts to be determined by the Chief Executive
Officer of Cell Pathways, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of
OSI.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase by OSI under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under the
purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Cell Pathways will
be recorded, as of completion of the merger, at their respective fair values and
added to those of OSI. Reported financial condition and results of operations of
OSI issued after completion of the merger will reflect Cell Pathways' balances
and results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of
operations of Cell Pathways. Following the completion of the merger, the
earnings of OSI will reflect purchase accounting adjustments, including in-
process research and development write-offs and increased amortization and
depreciation expense for acquired assets.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code, related regulations, existing administrative interpretations and court
decisions, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion assumes that Cell Pathways' stockholders hold their shares of Cell
Pathways stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.
This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be important to Cell Pathways' stockholders either in light of your
particular circumstances or if a Cell Pathways' stockholder is subject to
special rules. These special rules include those relating to:

     - stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or residents or that are foreign
       corporations, partnerships, estates or trusts;

     - financial institutions;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities;

     - stockholders who acquired their Cell Pathways stock by exercising options
       or similar derivative securities or otherwise as compensation; and

     - stockholders who hold their Cell Pathways stock as part of a hedge,
       straddle, appreciated financial position or conversion transaction.

     This section, as it relates to matters of U.S. federal income tax law,
constitutes the opinions of Morgan Lewis and Mintz Levin. These opinions are
based on a number of assumptions, representations and covenants, including the
assumption that the merger will be completed as described in this document and
that the representations contained in letters delivered to counsel by Cell
Pathways, OSI and the merger subsidiary in connection with the delivery of the
opinions will be accurate through the closing. The opinions neither bind the IRS
nor preclude the IRS from adopting a position contrary to that expressed in the
opinions. Cell Pathways and OSI cannot assure you that contrary positions will
not be successfully asserted by the IRS or adopted by a court if the issues are
litigated. Neither Cell Pathways nor OSI intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS
with respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

     Based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations stated above, it
is the opinion of Morgan Lewis and Mintz Levin that the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and OSI, Cell
Pathways and the merger subsidiary will each be a party to that reorganization.
As a result of the qualification of the merger as a reorganization, the material
federal income tax consequences will be as described below.

 TAX CONSEQUENCES TO CELL PATHWAYS STOCKHOLDERS

     Except as discussed below with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any portion of additional shares of OSI common stock
received pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement that is treated as
imputed interest, Cell Pathways' stockholders will not recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes on their receipt of OSI common stock or the
contingent value rights in exchange for their Cell Pathways' common stock in the
merger.

     The aggregate tax basis of the OSI common stock received by Cell Pathways'
stockholders in exchange for their Cell Pathways' common stock (including
fractional shares of OSI common stock that are converted to cash and any
additional shares of OSI common stock that are distributed pursuant to the
contingent value rights agreement) will be the same as the aggregate tax basis
of the Cell Pathways common stock surrendered in exchange therefor and, in the
case of additional shares of OSI common stock received pursuant to the
contingent rights agreement, such tax basis will be increased by any amount
treated as imputed interest.

     Until additional shares are distributed pursuant to the contingent value
rights agreement or such agreement terminates without distributions, the interim
basis of the OSI common stock received by each Cell Pathways stockholder in
exchange for such stockholder's Cell Pathways common stock will be determined by
assuming that such stockholder will receive the maximum number of additional
shares of OSI common stock that could be issued pursuant to the contingent value
rights agreement. Upon final determination of the number of shares to be issued
pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement, the aggregate tax basis will
be reallocated by the exchanging Cell Pathways' stockholder among the shares of
OSI common stock actually received.

     The holding period of the OSI common stock received by Cell Pathways
stockholders in exchange for their Cell Pathways common stock (including
fractional shares of OSI common stock that are converted to cash and any
additional shares of OSI common stock that are distributed pursuant to the
contingent value rights agreement) will include the holding period of the Cell
Pathways common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, except that the portion
of additional shares of OSI common stock received pursuant to the contingent
value rights agreement which represent the receipt of imputed interest income,
as described below, will begin a new holding period upon receipt.

     Stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of OSI common
stock will be treated as having received the fractional shares and then as
having exchanged the fractional shares for cash in a redemption by OSI. A
stockholder will recognize gain or loss as a result of this deemed redemption in
an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
portion of the tax basis of the stockholder's Cell Pathways common stock
surrendered in the merger that is allocable to the fractional share.

     Stockholders who demand appraisal of their shares under Delaware General
Corporation Law and receive a cash payment with respect to their shares
generally will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received and the stockholder's basis in such shares. The gain or
loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss.

 IMPUTED INTEREST ON ADDITIONAL SHARES RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THE CONTINGENT VALUE
 RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     Under current law the deferred receipt of additional shares in a
reorganization, such as those to be received pursuant to the contingent value
rights agreement, requires that a portion of the additional shares be treated as
interest income. Where there is no express provision for interest, as is the
case here, under the current regulations interest will be imputed under Section
483 of the Code. Thus, if the additional shares become payable more than one
year after the merger, a portion of such shares will constitute ordinary
interest income. The amount of such interest income will be calculated by taking
the fair market value of any additional shares issued and discounting such
amount from the date of issuance back to the time of the merger using the
imputed interest rate under the Code. The imputed interest rate will be the
"applicable federal rate" provided under Section 1274(d) of the Code as of the
time of the merger. Thus, the longer the period of time until the additional
shares are received, the greater the proportion of such shares that will be
treated as ordinary interest income. Each additional share received will be
deemed to represent its pro rata share of the interest income. Upon the issuance
of any additional shares, OSI will report to the recipient and to the IRS the
amount of such interest income, as required by the Code.

 TAX CONSEQUENCES TO OSI AND CELL PATHWAYS

     OSI, including its merger subsidiary, and Cell Pathways will not recognize
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of the merger,
except that a portion of additional shares issued pursuant to the contingent
value rights agreement will be treated as interest paid at such time and will be
deductible subject to applicable Internal Revenue Code limitations.

 BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     Unless a stockholder complies with reporting and/or certification
procedures or is an exempt recipient under the backup withholding and
information reporting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury
regulations, the stockholder may be subject to a backup withholding tax, the
current rate of which is

30%, on any cash payments received in the merger and on the portion of any
additional shares of OSI common stock received pursuant to the contingent value
rights agreement that are treated as imputed interest. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against the stockholder's federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is furnished to the IRS.

THIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE
MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. THIS DISCUSSION IS
NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF EVERY POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAX CONSEQUENCE OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE
DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT
ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, OSI AND CELL PATHWAYS STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH
YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR
FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

COVENANTS UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT

 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

     Until the closing of the merger, Cell Pathways has agreed to operate its
business solely in the ordinary course consistent with its past practices. Cell
Pathways also has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
substantially intact its business, to keep available the services of its

customers, suppliers and other persons with which it has significant business
relations.

     In addition to these agreements regarding the general conduct of its
business, Cell Pathways has agreed to refrain from taking any of the following
actions without the prior written consent of OSI, which OSI may not unreasonably
withhold, condition or delay:

     - issue or sell any shares of capital stock, or any options, warrants,
       convertible securities or other rights of any kind to acquire any shares
       of capital stock of Cell Pathways, except in connection with the exercise

       Purchase Plan;

     - amend the terms of any stock option or stock purchase plan or any
       outstanding security, option or warrant;

       stock;

     - amend its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or the charter
       documents of any of its subsidiaries;

     - pay any severance, special bonus or special remuneration to any director
       or employee, except as required to comply with applicable laws or
       pursuant to existing plans or policies;

     - increase salaries, wage rates or compensation of directors or, other than
       in the ordinary course of business, employees;

     - enter into material agreements with respect to any intellectual property
       rights;

     - make or change a material tax election, settle or compromise tax
       liabilities or agreements to extend statute of limitations, or enter into
       any tax allocation, tax sharing, tax indemnity or closing agreement;

     - acquire any equity interest in any entity;

     - authorize or make any capital expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the
       aggregate;

     - make any loans to any third party;

     - initiate or participate in any new clinical trials;

     - make any material changes to personnel or other business policies; and

     - hire any employees, other than in the ordinary course of business.

     Until the closing of the merger, OSI has agreed not to take any action that
would make any of its representations and warranties contained in the merger
agreement untrue in any material respect or that would be reasonably likely to
materially delay the consummation of the merger.

 NO SOLICITATION OF OTHER PROPOSALS BY CELL PATHWAYS

     The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Cell Pathways
from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these "no solicitation"
provisions, Cell Pathways has agreed that until the merger agreement is
terminated, it will not, nor will it permit any of its subsidiaries or
representatives acting on its behalf or on behalf of its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate, facilitate, induce or encourage or take any action
       that could reasonably be expected to lead to the making, submission or
       announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, as defined below;

     - participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any
       information or otherwise co-operate in any way with respect to any
       Acquisition Proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal;

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or contract
       contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction; or

     - withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to OSI, its approval or
       recommendation of the merger.

     However, the merger agreement does not prevent Cell Pathways from
participating in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnishing
information or otherwise cooperating in any way in response to an Acquisition
Proposal if:

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with independent legal counsel, that the failure to do so
       could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
       duties to Cell Pathways' stockholders;

     - the Cell Pathways Board of Directors determines in good faith that the
       Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
       Proposal, as defined below;

     - after giving prior written notice to OSI, Cell Pathways enters into a
       confidentiality agreement; and

     - there has been no previous violation of the "no solicitation" provisions
       with regard to such Acquisition Proposal.

     The merger agreement also prohibits the Cell Pathways Board of Directors
from withdrawing or modifying, or proposing to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to OSI, its approval or recommendation of the merger. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
the Cell Pathways Board of Directors determines in good faith (i) after
consultation with independent legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to Cell Pathways' stockholders and (ii) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Cell Pathways Board of Directors may
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the merger.

     "Acquisition Proposal" means:

     - any bona fide written offer or proposal to acquire (i) all or at least
       20% of the consolidated assets of Cell Pathways and its subsidiaries, or
       (ii) any equity securities of Cell Pathways or its subsidiaries;

     - any tender or exchange offer for any class of equity securities of Cell
       Pathways;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of at least 20% of
       the consolidated assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
       similar transaction involving Cell Pathways or its subsidiaries; or

     - any other transaction which, if consummated, would impede, interfere
       with, prevent or materially delay the merger or materially dilute the
       benefits to OSI of the merger.

     "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by
a third party to purchase all of the outstanding Cell Pathways voting stock or
all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Cell Pathways and its
subsidiaries without any financing condition that the Cell Pathways Board of
Directors determines, in its reasonable judgment, after consultation with
independent legal counsel and its financial advisor:

     - is more favorable to the Cell Pathways stockholders than the merger; and

     - is capable of being consummated.

 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE FOR CELL PATHWAYS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     OSI and CP Merger Corporation will honor Cell Pathways' indemnification
obligations under agreements with its directors and officers and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws in effect before the effective time of the merger
for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger. The merger
agreement also provides that OSI will purchase a six year "tail" policy that
will have the effect of maintaining the directors' and officers' existing
liability insurance policies with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the completion of the merger. The term of the coverage of the "tail"
policy may be reduced, if necessary, to a term of coverage that can be obtained
for a premium equal to $1,562,500 plus any unearned premium actually refunded or
credited to Cell Pathways with respect to Cell Pathways' existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies.

 OTHER COVENANTS

     The merger agreement contains covenants of both parties relating to, among
other things, public announcements, notifications, regulatory filings, reporting
of the transaction for federal income tax purposes, further assurances and
cooperation in obtaining consents approvals and affiliates' agreements.

     Cell Pathways has also agreed, among other things, to grant OSI access to
company information, employees and facilities, as is reasonably necessary.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Each of OSI's, CP Merger Corporation's and Cell Pathways' obligations to
complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified

       the merger, or which is otherwise likely to have a material adverse
       effect on the business, condition or results of OSI or Cell Pathways;

     - the approval for listing on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of
       OSI common stock to be issued, or to be reserved for issuance, in

       as to materiality being true and correct as of the date of the merger
       agreement and the date the merger is completed;

     - the representations and warranties of the other party that are not
       qualified as to materiality being true and correct in all material

       case as described above;

     - there having been no material adverse affect on the business, condition
       or results of the other party after the date of the merger agreement; and

     - the receipt of a tax opinion from counsel.

     In addition, OSI's and CP Merger Corporation's obligations to complete the
merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following
additional conditions before completion of the merger:

     - there must not be pending any action or proceeding having a reasonable
       likelihood of success by or before any governmental authority or court,
       nor must there be any judgment, decree or order of any governmental
       authority or court, seeking to make the merger materially more costly, to
       obtain material damages in connection with the merger, or to prohibit or
       limit the ownership or operation by OSI or Cell Pathways of their, or
       their subsidiaries', respective business or assets, or compelling OSI,
       Cell Pathways or their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold
       separately any material portion of their business or assets, as a result
       of the merger;

     - appraisal rights must not have been exercised by holders of more than
       7.5% of the outstanding voting shares of Cell Pathways;

     - Robert J. Towarnicki, Brian J. Hayden and Rifat Pamukcu must have entered
       into a consulting agreement in form and substance satisfactory to OSI.
       See the "Background and Reasons for the Merger -- Interests of Cell
       Pathways Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger -- Consulting
       Arrangements" on page 33.

     - absence of certain related party transactions.

     Cell Pathways also made additional representations and warranties to OSI

     - compliance with governmental regulations concerning employees and
       relations with employees;

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective
time, whether before or after its adoption by Cell Pathways stockholders:

     - by written consent of OSI, CP Merger Corporation and Cell Pathways;

     - by OSI, CP Merger Corporation or Cell Pathways:

      - if the effective time of the merger has not occurred before August 6,
        2003, unless that party's own breach of the agreement is the reason that
        the merger has not been consummated;

      - if there is a non-appealable government action prohibiting the
        consummation of the merger, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
        have issued an order or other action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
        the merger or there is a law making consummation of the merger illegal
        or otherwise prohibited; or

      - if Cell Pathways stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement.

     - by OSI or CP Merger Corporation:

      - if the Cell Pathways Board of Directors receives a Superior Proposal (as
        defined above) and withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of
        the merger after determining in good faith, after consultation with
        independent legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could
        reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties;
        or

      - for a material misrepresentation or an uncured breach by Cell Pathways.

     - by Cell Pathways:

      - if the Cell Pathways Board of Directors receives a Superior Proposal (as
        described above) and, withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation
        of the merger after determining in good faith, after consultation with
        independent legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could
        reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties,
        unless Cell Pathways is in breach of the "no solicitation" provisions or
        has not paid the termination fee (as described below); or

      - for a material misrepresentation or an uncured breach by OSI.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the conditions set forth
above, unless the termination results from the willful failure of either party
to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party,
or the willful failure by either party to perform a covenant, all further
obligations of the parties under the merger agreement will terminate, except
that any obligations with respect to payment of the termination fee described
below will survive.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES

 PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE

     Cell Pathways has agreed to pay OSI $1,250,000 if the merger agreement is
terminated in any of the following circumstances:

     - OSI or Cell Pathways terminates the merger agreement because the Cell
       Pathways Board of Directors receives a Superior Proposal (as described
       above) and withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of the
       merger;

     - OSI or Cell Pathways terminates the merger agreement because Cell
       Pathways stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement and an
       Acquisition Proposal (as described above), which was proposed prior to
       such termination, is consummated within nine months of such termination.

     - OSI terminates the merger agreement for a material misrepresentation or
       an uncured breach by Cell Pathways and an Acquisition Proposal (as
       described above), which was proposed prior to such termination, is
       consummated within nine months of such termination.

 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AND INTEREST

     If Cell Pathways fails to pay the termination fee when due, in addition to
the termination fee Cell Pathways will be required to pay OSI's costs of
collection and interest on the unpaid fee at the prime rate.

 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES

     OSI and Cell Pathways will share equally the fees and expenses of printing
and filing this proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement, and
each will each pay its own other merger-related fees and expenses.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

     OSI and Cell Pathways may amend or waive any provision of the merger
agreement in writing before the effective time of the merger, except that after
the Cell Pathways stockholders have approved the merger, the further approval of
the Cell Pathways stockholders would be required to reduce the amount or change
the type of consideration that they will receive in the merger.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     If the merger is consummated, holders of Cell Pathways common stock who do
not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement will have the right to seek
an appraisal of, and to be paid the "fair value" for, their shares of Cell
Pathways common stock, instead of receiving the OSI common stock and contingent
value right that such stockholders would otherwise be entitled to under the
merger agreement. In order to assert

these rights such stockholders must follow the procedures set forth in Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     These rights are commonly referred to as "appraisal rights" or "dissenters'
rights." The following summary of appraisal rights is qualified in its entirety
by the text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is
reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus.

     This summary does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights, or otherwise constitute any legal or other
advice. If a stockholder wishes to exercise his or her appraisal rights, such
stockholder is urged to contact his or her legal counsel or advisors. Failure to
follow strictly the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in a loss of
appraisal rights. If a stockholder loses his or her appraisal rights, such
stockholder will be entitled to receive OSI common stock and the contingent
value right as determined under the merger agreement.

     Appraisal rights are available only to the record holder of shares.
References in Section 262 to "stockholders" are to record holders. References in
the summary below to "you" and "your" assume that you are a record holder. If
you wish to exercise appraisal rights but have a beneficial interest in shares
which are held of record by or in the name of another person, such as a broker
or nominee, you should act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 to perfect your appraisal rights.

     Section 262 requires Cell Pathways to notify you, at least 20 days prior to
the special meeting, as to the availability of appraisal rights and to provide
you with a copy of the text of Section 262. This proxy statement/prospectus,
including Annex D, serves as the required notice and text.

     To claim your appraisal rights, you must do each of the following:

     - deliver to Cell Pathways prior to the vote on the merger a written demand
       for an appraisal of your shares;

     - continuously hold your shares from the date you deliver a written demand
       for an appraisal through the completion of the merger;

     - not vote in favor of the merger agreement; and

     - file within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if Cell
       Pathways does not file within that time, a petition in the Delaware Court
       of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of your shares.
       Cell Pathways is under no obligation and has no intent to file any
       petition.

     If you sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of your shares before the
merger is completed, you will lose your appraisal rights with respect to those
shares. If neither any stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights nor Cell
Pathways has filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, then all stockholders' appraisal rights
will be lost.

     Voting against the adoption of the merger agreement or otherwise failing to
vote for the adoption of the merger agreement will not by itself constitute a
demand for an appraisal or sufficient notice of an election to exercise
appraisal rights. Any demand for an appraisal must be in writing, signed and
mailed or delivered to:

                              Cell Pathways, Inc.
                              702 Electronic Drive
                          Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044
                Attention: Brian Hayden, Chief Financial Officer

     A written demand must reasonably inform Cell Pathways of the identity of
the stockholder and of the stockholder's intent to demand appraisal of his, her
or its shares of Cell Pathways common stock.

     A demand for appraisal should be signed by or on behalf of the stockholder
exactly as the stockholder's name appears on the stockholder's stock
certificates. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as
by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be executed in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint
owners, may

execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a record holder; however, in the
demand the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose
that the agent is executing the demand as an agent for the record owner or
owners. A record holder such as a broker who holds shares as nominee for several
beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights for the shares held for one or
more beneficial owners and not exercise rights for the shares held for other
beneficial owners. In this case, the written demand should state the number of
shares for which appraisal rights are being demanded. When no number of shares
is stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held of record by the
broker or nominee.

     Cell Pathways will send notice of the effective time of the merger to each
stockholder who has properly demanded appraisal rights under Section 262 and has
not voted in favor of the merger agreement. Cell Pathways will send this notice
within 10 days after the effective time of the merger.

     If you have complied with the requirements for claiming your appraisal
rights, then during the 120 days following the effective time of the merger, you
may request from Cell Pathways a statement as to the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the number of holders of those shares. Upon any
request, which must be made in writing, Cell Pathways will mail a statement of
that information to you within 10 days.

     If a petition for an appraisal is filed timely, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will hold a hearing on the petition to determine the stockholders
entitled to appraisal rights and the "fair value" of their shares. The
determination of fair value will not include any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. The court will also determine a
fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value of the shares. The court may determine that the fair value of the
shares is more than, the same as or less than the value of the OSI common stock
and contingent value right you would have received under the merger agreement.
An investment banking opinion as to fairness from a financial point of view is
not necessarily an opinion as to fair value under Section 262. The Delaware
Supreme Court has stated that "proof of value by any techniques or methods that
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court" should be considered in the appraisal proceedings.

     The costs of the action may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and taxed upon the parties as the court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the court may order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in an appraisal proceeding, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of
experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata against the
value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal.

     If you have duly demanded an appraisal of your shares, you will not, after
the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote those shares for any
purpose, nor will you be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions on those shares, except for dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders as of a record date prior to the effective time of the
merger.

     You may withdraw your demand for appraisal of your shares within 60 days
after the effective time of the merger. Any attempt to withdraw your demand more
than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require the written
approval of Cell Pathways. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the
Delaware Court of Chancery, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed
without court approval.

     If you properly demand appraisal of your shares, but fail to perfect your
appraisal rights, otherwise lose your appraisal rights or effectively withdraw
your demand for an appraisal, your shares will be converted into the right to
receive OSI common stock and a contingent value right as determined under the
merger agreement, without interest.

     OSI will not be obligated to close the merger if the aggregate number of
shares held by Cell Pathways stockholders demanding appraisal rights exceeds
7.5% of the number of shares of Cell Pathways common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The legal
opinions as to the tax-free nature of the merger will be based in part on the
assumption that this 7.5% threshold will not be exceeded. See the discussion
under "The Merger and the Merger Agreement -- Material United States Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 39.

NASDAQ LISTING OF OSI COMMON STOCK

     OSI has agreed to file a listing notification with the Nasdaq National
Market concerning the OSI common stock to be issued to Cell Pathways
stockholders in the merger, including shares of OSI common stock issuable upon
conversion of the contingent value rights. The contingent value rights are
nontransferable and they will not be listed with the Nasdaq National Market or
any other exchange.

RESALES OF OSI COMMON STOCK BY CELL PATHWAYS' AFFILIATES

     Cell Pathways stockholders may freely transfer the shares of OSI common
stock received in the merger, unless they are individuals and entities who are
deemed to be "affiliates" of Cell Pathways before the merger or deemed to be
"affiliates" of OSI after the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
of Cell Pathways or OSI include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with, Cell Pathways or OSI and may
include executive officers and directors as well as principal stockholders.
These affiliates or their brokers risk being characterized as "underwriters"
when they sell shares of OSI common stock received in the merger. The U.S.
securities laws require registration of shares sold by underwriters. An
affiliate and its broker can avoid being characterized as an underwriter and,
therefore, avoid the Securities Act registration requirements by selling shares
in compliance with Rule 145 or Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Rule 145
covers sales by Cell Pathways affiliates, and Rule 144 covers sales by OSI
affiliates. Each rule limits the number of shares an affiliate can sell in a
particular period of time. The merger agreement requires Cell Pathways to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to execute and
deliver to OSI a written agreement to the effect that the affiliate will not
offer or sell or otherwise dispose of OSI common stock issued to the affiliate
in the merger, including shares issued pursuant to the contingent value rights,
if any, in violation of the Securities Act or the related rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC.

     This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of OSI common stock
received by any person who may be deemed to be an affiliate of Cell Pathways
and/or OSI.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     OSI and Cell Pathways are not aware of any material governmental or
regulatory requirements that must be complied with regarding the merger, other
than federal securities laws and the filing of documents describing principal
terms of the merger agreement with the secretary of state of Delaware. At this
time we do not expect the merger to be subject to the requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules
promulgated under that Act by the Federal Trade Commission, which prevent some
transactions from being completed until required information and materials are
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the applicable waiting periods are terminated
or expire. However, if the market price of OSI common stock rises sufficiently
to cause the total value of the merger consideration to exceed $50 million, then
OSI and Cell Pathways may be required to make filings under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

                                BUSINESS OF OSI

     OSI is a leading biotechnology company focused on the discovery,
development and commercialization of high-quality oncology products that both
extend life and improve the quality-of-life for cancer patients worldwide. OSI
has established a balanced pipeline of oncology drug candidates that includes
both next-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and novel mechanism-based,
gene-targeted therapies.

     OSI's most advanced drug candidate, Tarceva(TM) (erlotinib HC1), is a small
molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor, or HER1/EGFR. The
protein product of the HER1/EGFR gene is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is
over-expressed or mutated in many major solid tumors. OSI believes HER1/EGFR
inhibitors represent an exciting new class of relatively safe and well tolerated
anti-cancer agents that may have utility in treating a wide range of cancer
patients. Tarceva(TM) is an oral once-a-day small molecule drug designed to
specifically block the activity of the HER1/EGFR protein. Currently, Tarceva(TM)
is being developed in an alliance with Genentech and Roche. If the drug receives
regulatory approval, Genentech will lead the marketing effort in the United
States and Roche will market it in the rest of the world. OSI will receive
milestone payments from both Genentech and Roche, an equal profit share from
U.S. sales, and royalties on sales outside of the United States. Tarceva(TM) has
demonstrated encouraging indications of anti-cancer activity in single-agent,
open label Phase II trials in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer
and ovarian cancer. Tarceva(TM) is currently in Phase III clinical trials for
non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.

     Behind Tarceva(TM) OSI has five additional drug candidates in earlier
stages of clinical development. Three of these (OSI-211, OSI-7904L and OSI-7836)
are next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents which are being developed by
OSI and the other two (CP-547,632 and CP-724,714) are gene-targeted therapies
currently being developed by Pfizer Inc. OSI owns commercial rights to the first
three and will receive royalty payments on the latter two if they are
successfully commercialized.

     OSI's next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy candidates are designed to
improve upon currently marketed products in the same drug class. OSI-211 is a
liposomal formulation of lurtotecan, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, that is being
developed to compete with topotecan (Hycamtin(R)). OSI-7904L is a liposomal
formulation of a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, GW1843, that is being developed
as a potential competitor to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine (Xeloda(R)),
and OSI-7836 is a nucleoside analog being developed to compete with gemcitabine
(Gemzar(R)). OSI-211 is in Phase II clinical trials, and OSI-7904L and OSI-7836
are in Phase I clinical trials. Like Tarceva(TM), the two gene-targeted
therapies are receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CP-547,632 is a small
molecule targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR,
and CP-724,714 is a small molecule targeting HER2/erbB2. Both agents are
currently in Phase I clinical trials.

     In order to support its clinical pipeline, OSI has established (through
acquisition and internal investment) a high quality oncology clinical
development and regulatory affairs capability comprised of a fully developed
infrastructure and over 140 professionals. OSI has also acquired a pilot scale
chemical manufacturing and process chemistry group. Behind its clinical pipeline
OSI has an extensive, fully integrated small molecule drug discovery
organization designed to generate a pipeline of high quality oncology drug
candidates to move into clinical development. This research operation has been
built upon OSI's historical strengths in high throughput screening, chemical
libraries, medicinal and combinatorial chemistry, and automated drug profiling
technology platforms.

     The following table summarizes the status of OSI's more advanced oncology

     On March 12, 2003, OSI announced that it had entered into an agreement with
an affiliate of Serono S.A., Ares Trading, S.A., under which OSI has the
exclusive right to market and promote the drug Novantrone(R) (mitoxantrone
hydrochloride) for all approved oncology indications in the United States. In
consideration for these exclusive rights, OSI will pay Serono initial fees
totaling $55 million plus quarterly maintenance fees in return for commissions
on net sales in oncology. To support Novantrone(R), OSI intends to build
commercial operations to include a sales force and an associated marketing and
sales management infrastructure. OSI estimates that the fiscal year 2004
commission revenues on Novantrone(R) oncology sales will be between
approximately $20 million and $30 million.

     Novantrone(R) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute
nonlymphocytic leukemia, which includes myelogenous, promyelocytic, monocytic
and erythroid acute leukemias, and the relief of pain associated with advanced
hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The drug is also approved for certain
advanced forms of multiple sclerosis. Serono will continue to be responsible for
the marketing of the multiple sclerosis indication for Novantrone(R) and book
all U.S. sales in all indications. Total sales in 2002 of Novantrone(R) were
approximately $80 million.

OSI'S STRATEGY

     OSI believes that Tarceva(TM) has established a corporate presence for OSI
in the oncology field. OSI's strategy over the last several years has been
designed to capitalize upon this presence and to re-orient its

business towards becoming a world class oncology organization. To this end, OSI
has raised capital, formed alliances and engaged in merger and acquisition
activity with the strategic intent to:

     - maximize OSI's prospects for successful development and commercialization
       of Tarceva(TM);

     - enhance OSI's skill sets and improve the quality of its organization,
       allowing OSI to establish a comprehensive array of research, development
       and business skills necessary for its cancer mission;

     - divest or exit from its current non-oncology research activities and
       alliances;

     - engage in active in-licensing and partnering efforts to add to OSI's
       cancer pipeline and complement its internal cancer research programs; and

     - continue to invest in opportunities that will lead to successful growth
       while aggressively managing the risks inherent in the industry in order
       to sustain a strong balance sheet through to profitability.

     As OSI moves forward, it intends to follow through on the following core
elements of its strategy:

     Execution on Tarceva(TM).  Together with its partners, Genentech and Roche,
OSI has formulated a comprehensive, global development program for Tarceva(TM).
Since the beginning of the alliance, OSI, with its partners, has collectively
initiated numerous clinical trials, four of which are Phase III
registration-oriented trials in lung and pancreatic cancers. This registration
strategy focuses on the execution of adequate, controlled and well-designed
studies to support a worldwide registration program. All four Phase III trials
are designed as large-scale, placebo controlled, double-blinded trials with a
primary endpoint of survival and several secondary endpoints which include,
among others, tumor response, time to progression, symptom relief and quality of
life. The alliance has now completed targeted enrollment in all four Phase III
trials which involve a total of approximately 3,500 patients. Should these
studies prove successful, OSI has established a goal of achieving profitability
within 18 to 24 months of market launch of Tarceva(TM).

     Focus on Oncology.  OSI intends to focus its business entirely on oncology
and continue to build upon its extensive pipeline of oncology product
candidates, its strong core of discovery research, and its top-tier oncology
clinical development and regulatory affairs group. As its pipeline reaches the
commercialization stage, OSI also intends to establish a full commercial
operation, initially in the U.S. market. Although OSI intends to commercialize
selected products independently, OSI will also continue to engage in marketing
partnerships where its believes this will add value to OSI's ability to
effectively and competitively commercialize its products.

     OSI also intends to complete the divestiture of all remaining non-oncology
research programs. In July 2002, OSI agreed to accelerate the conclusion of the
phase-down period of its funded research alliance with Anaderm Research
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer, focused on the development of
novel treatments for skin and hair conditions. OSI completed the transfer of all
research related to the collaboration in February 2003. OSI is in the process of
divesting its diabetes program and certain of its adenosine receptor assets into
an entity with the intent that this entity subsequently will be funded by third
party investors and will be one in which OSI will maintain a minority interest.
This planned divestiture coupled with steps OSI took in October 2002 to re-size
and re-focus the skill sets of its organization has positioned OSI with
approximately 425 research, development and business personnel focused entirely
on oncology.

     These steps will allow OSI to maintain the level of resource commitment OSI
believes is required to achieve its primary goal of building a first-class
oncology franchise with a pipeline of clinical and research opportunities
anchored around Tarceva(TM).

     Licensing and Acquiring Oncology Products and Clinical Candidates.  In
order to effectively manage the risks inherent in pharmaceutical research and
development and to complement its internal research efforts, OSI believes it is
essential that it continue to explore licensing and acquisition initiatives
designed to add oncology products and clinical candidates to its pipeline in
order to further strengthen OSI's growing position in oncology. In December
2001, OSI acquired Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s entire pipeline of clinical
candidates in oncology and certain related intellectual property, as well as
Gilead's Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research, regulatory
affairs and drug development personnel, infrastructure, and facilities. This

transaction accelerated OSI's development and commercialization capabilities
with the addition of an outstanding and complementary drug development and
oncology group comprised of approximately 120 professionals, and augmented OSI's
pipeline of gene-targeted small molecule therapeutics with several promising
next-generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents currently in clinical development.
Under the terms of the transaction, OSI received exclusive worldwide development
and commercialization rights to Gilead's three clinical development candidates
in oncology. With a full array of cancer drug discovery and development
capabilities and a strong balance sheet, OSI expects to be well positioned to
compete for premier in-licensing and acquisition opportunities.

     Establishing commercial operations.  A key corporate goal for OSI has been
to secure rights to an in-the-market therapeutic product as a vehicle to enable
it to establish a sales and marketing organization and continue its mission of
building a first class oncology franchise. OSI believes that with the
Novantrone(R) transaction described above it has taken a significant step toward
accomplishing this goal.

     Accessing a quality product that will allow OSI to generate a credible
revenue flow and build a high quality sales and marketing organization has
proven to be a challenge as a result of tremendous competition for the
in-licensing or acquisition of an in-the-market therapeutic product. OSI
believes the opportunity to acquire the rights to Novantrone(R) presented itself
at the right time and is the right size financially. The transaction, in OSI's
view, allows it to meet its strategic goal and will provide a modest annual
cash-flow positive outcome by fiscal year 2004 and for succeeding fiscal years.
OSI further believes the following tangible and intangible benefits of this
transaction, among others, warranted the decision to secure an agreement with
Serono:

     - the enhancement of the possibility for future in-licensing and regional
       co-promote deals for other marketed oncology products;

     - the ability to directly market in the United States its future pipeline
       products, thereby leading to an improved economic share of product
       revenues; and

     - the further validation of OSI as a quality development and
       commercialization partner for oncology development candidates.

     In order to rapidly establish a core capability in the commercial area, OSI
intends to secure a short-term transitional arrangement with a contract sales
organization to provide a core of sales representatives, sales and marketing
operations support personnel and core infrastructure needs. Additionally, OSI
intends to recruit a corporate executive level candidate to lead the
establishment of a core commercial operation.

     OSI believes that, through the Serono and Gilead transactions, through the
proposed merger with Cell Pathways (if approved by the Cell Pathways
stockholders) and through its research and development investments, it has
created a top quality oncology organization around Tarceva(TM). Upon the
establishment of a commercial organization, OSI believes that it will have
completed the assembly of a fully integrated oncology organization from
discovery through to commercialization. Assuming Cell Pathways stockholder
approval of the proposed merger, OSI will have a portfolio consisting of two
marketed products, Novantrone(R) and Gelclair(TM), two phase III programs,
Tarceva(TM) and Aptosyn(R), and six earlier stage clinical programs, two of
which, OSI-211 and CP461, are in phase II trials. This clinical pipeline is
diversified into three areas of investment: (i) novel anti-oncogene, receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors; (ii) novel apoptotic molecules; and (iii)
next-generation cytotoxic agents. Supporting this pipeline is a highly competent
development organization of approximately 140 professionals as well as a
170-person research organization focused on next-generation small molecule
cancer drugs.

SEC. For more details about how you can obtain this information, you should read

                           BUSINESS OF CELL PATHWAYS

GENERAL

     Cell Pathways is a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the
research and development of products to treat and prevent cancer, and the future
commercialization of such products. Cell Pathways' technology may prove to have
applicability beyond the treatment and prevention of cancer, including, for
example, treatment of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.
Cell Pathways also imports, promotes through licensees and sells Gelclair(TM)
Concentrated Oral Gel to oncology, dental and other markets. Cell Pathways will
likely be considered to be in the development stage until, if ever, Cell
Pathways receives approval for, and generates significant revenues from, the
marketing and selling of one or more of its pharmaceutical drug candidates, or
generates significant revenues from its marketing and selling of products made
by others, such as Gelclair(TM).

     Cell Pathways' technology is based upon a mechanism which it believes,
based on its research, can be targeted to induce selective apoptosis, or
programmed cell death, in precancerous and cancerous cells without affecting
apoptosis in normal cells. Cell Pathways has created a new class of selective
apoptotic anti-neoplastic drugs, or SAANDs, and has synthesized many new
chemical compounds in this new class. Published data indicate that some of these
compounds have anti-proliferative activity in addition to pro-apoptotic
activity.

     Cell Pathways' product development program focused initially on compounds
likely to be helpful in treating precancerous lesions such as colonic polyps and
cervical dysplasia. Attention next turned to the prevention of the recurrence of
prostate cancer and breast cancer. Clinical trials subsequently expanded into
the direct treatment of prostate and lung cancer. Cell Pathways has also made
arrangements for clinical trials of its first compound, Aptosyn(R) (exisulind),
in combination with leading cancer chemotherapeutic agents of major
pharmaceutical companies in trials in lung, prostate and breast cancers; many of
these trials are supported by major pharmaceutical companies, by clinical
oncology cooperative groups affiliated with the National Cancer Institute or by
investigator obtained grants. In 1999 Cell Pathways commenced clinical
development of a second compound, CP461, as a single agent in cancer
indications. Cell Pathways has also commenced clinical testing of CP461 in a
non-cancerous autoimmune indication, inflammatory bowel disease.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Cell Pathways' primary objectives have been to be a leader in the
development of pharmaceutical products to treat and prevent cancer. Recognizing
that its technology may have applicability beyond the fields of cancer and
precancer, Cell Pathways also commenced a clinical trial of CP461 in the
autoimmune indication of Crohn's Disease and correspondingly enlarged its
objectives. Cell Pathways' intentions have been to:

     - Pursue clinical development of Aptosyn(R), with emphasis on cancer
       indications.

     - Pursue clinical development of CP461 in cancer indications.

     - Develop Aptosyn(R), CP461 and other SAANDs as part of combination therapy
       with leading chemotherapeutic agents.

     - Clinically test SAANDs technology in non-cancer indications where
       pro-apoptotic activity (whether or not accompanied by anti-proliferative
       activity) may hold promise, commencing with the clinical testing of CP461
       in Crohn's Disease.

     - Use its proprietary technology to develop additional SAANDs for cancer
       therapy and for cancer chemoprevention.

     - Develop strategic pharmaceutical industry collaborations, alliances and
       combinations for research, development and/or commercialization.

     - Selectively and opportunistically acquire or in-license technologies,
       products and/or companies devoted to the treatment, prevention,
       palliation and/or diagnosis of cancer.

     The difficult financing markets for companies at Cell Pathways' stage of
development, together with recent cutbacks in Cell Pathways' personnel and
programs, have placed constraints on the rate at which Cell Pathways is able to
pursue its objectives.

PRODUCTS IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT

     Cell Pathways is currently pursuing the clinical development of two SAANDs
product candidates, targeted at the treatment and management of cancer and
precancerous lesions. Its first compound, Aptosyn(R), is a sulfone derivative of
the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, sulindac. Aptosyn(R) is not
an NSAID and lacks the COX 1 and COX 2 inhibitory activity that is associated
with the serious upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding and kidney
injury observed with NSAID use. Its second compound, CP461, is a new chemical
entity that has composition of matter patents issued or filed in the major world
markets. CP461 is a more potent SAAND than Aptosyn(R) but retains the
characteristics of not being an NSAID and not inhibiting COX 1 and COX 2.

     Clinical trials of Aptosyn(R) commenced in 1994. By 1997, clinical
development of Aptosyn(R) had expanded to include several cancer and precancer
indications. In August 1999, Cell Pathways submitted to the FDA an NDA seeking
marketing approval for Aptosyn(R) for the precancerous orphan drug indication of
familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP. In September 2000, the FDA issued a "not
approvable" letter with respect to the NDA for FAP. The future of the FAP
program is uncertain.

     The focus of Cell Pathways' continuing development of Aptosyn(R) is in
cancer rather than in precancerous conditions. In 2001, Cell Pathways began
enrolling patients in a 600-patient Phase III trial comparing the combination of
Aptosyn(R) and Taxotere(R) (docetaxel) against Taxotere(R) plus placebo in
non-small cell lung cancer patients who have failed a prior platinum-containing
regimen. This trial completed enrollment of patients in March 2003.

     Cell Pathways began the clinical trial program of its second compound,
CP461, in 1999. By the end of 2001, CP461 was in pilot Phase IIa trials to
investigate its safety and efficacy in three cancer indications -- chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and hormone refractory prostate
cancer. These studies continue, as well as studies to determine a maximum
tolerated dose for CP461. In July 2002, Cell Pathways commenced a small Phase II
trial of CP461 in the non-cancerous indication of Crohn's Disease, a form of
inflammatory bowel disease.

     Aptosyn(R) and CP461 are the only Cell Pathways' product candidates which
Cell Pathways has been studying in clinical trials. No pharmaceutical product
may be marketed in the United States without FDA approval. There can be no
assurance that the FDA will approve any of Cell Pathways' product candidates for
marketing for any indication or as to when, if ever, any such approval would
occur.

AGREEMENTS TO MARKET GELCLAIR(TM)

     In January 2002 Cell Pathways signed an agreement with Sinclair
Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. of the United Kingdom to become the exclusive distributor
of Gelclair(TM) in North America. The FDA granted 510(k) clearance to market
Gelclair(TM) in December 2001 for use in the management of pain and relief of
pain by adhering to the mucosal surface of the mouth, soothing oral lesions of
various etiologies. These applications include oral mucositis/stomatitis (which
may be caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy), irritation due to oral
surgery and traumatic ulcers caused by braces or ill-fitting dentures or
disease. Gelclair(TM) is also indicated for treatment of diffuse aphthous
ulcers. The product, which is a clear viscous gel, is applied by rinsing in the
mouth for a short period of time, forming a coating over the mucosal surface of
the mouth and thereby soothing the pain and discomfort from oral lesions.

     In October 2002 Cell Pathways signed a three-year agreement with Celgene
Corporation to co-promote Gelclair(TM) in oncology markets and markets other
than the dental market in the United States. Celgene has an oncology field sales
force in excess of 90 representatives. Celgene commenced field sales promotional
efforts in mid-November 2002. Cell Pathways terminated its own sales force in
the fourth quarter of 2002. Celgene will receive a fee based on a fixed
percentage of net sales of Gelclair(TM) in the oncology and other markets.

     In August, 2002 Cell Pathways signed a four-year exclusive agreement with
the John O. Butler Company to market and, to a limited extent, distribute
Gelclair(TM) to the dental market in the United States and, if and when approved
for sale, in Canada. Butler is a leading international supplier of oral health
care products. Butler commenced its launch of Gelclair(TM) in the dental market
in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2002. Butler will receive a
marketing fee based on the amount of Gelclair(TM) sold in the dental market.

PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY

     Cell Pathways holds title or exclusive licenses to several issued U.S.
patents and pending patent applications relating to the therapeutic uses of
Aptosyn(R) in the treatment of neoplasia, precancerous lesions and/or other
indications. A composition of matter patent on this compound is not available to
Cell Pathways (or anyone else) because the sulfone derivative of sulindac, now
named exisulind, was described in the scientific and patent literature over 20
years ago. Thus, Cell Pathways' current patent rights relating to Aptosyn(R) are
limited to a series of patents and patent applications pertaining to various
specific uses of Aptosyn(R). Cell Pathways has also been issued or holds
exclusive licenses to various foreign patents (including patents in various
European countries, Australia, Canada, Korea and Japan) and pending applications
relating to the use of Aptosyn(R) in pharmaceutical compositions for the
treatment of neoplasia, precancerous lesions and/or other indications. In
Europe, Cell Pathways' patent rights relating to Aptosyn(R) are directed to the
use of Aptosyn(R) in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for the
treatment of precancerous lesions. Cell Pathways also holds title or exclusive
licenses to several pending U.S. and international patent applications relating
to uses of exisulind in combination with certain existing conventional
chemotherapeutics.

     Cell Pathways also holds title or exclusive licenses to patents and pending
applications relating to CP461, its composition of matter and various of its
therapeutic uses.

     In addition, Cell Pathways holds title or exclusive licenses to many
patents and patent applications on other compounds, or therapeutic methods
involving such compounds, for the treatment of colonic polyps, precancerous
lesions and/or neoplasia. Cell Pathways also has patents and patent applications
on methods for screening compounds for their usefulness in selectively inducing
apoptosis. Cell Pathways has also filed patent applications relating to
diagnostic methodologies, and patent applications relating to certain business
methods and packaged pharmaceuticals with descriptive material describing and
relating to the mechanisms of action.

     Cell Pathways also relies on trade secrets to protect technology,
especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or
obtainable or where patents have not been issued. Cell Pathways attempts to
protect its proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality
agreements and assignment of invention agreements with its employees and with
its consultants and certain contractors.

                     CELL PATHWAYS' MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
         AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Cell Pathways was incorporated in Delaware in July 1998 as a subsidiary of,
and as of November 3, 1998 successor to, a Delaware corporation of the same
name. As the context requires, "Cell Pathways" is used below to signify the
successor and/or the predecessor corporation and their subsidiaries.

OVERVIEW

     Cell Pathways is a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the
research and development of products to treat and prevent cancer, and the future
commercialization of such products. Cell Pathways also markets and sells
Gelclair(TM) manufactured by Sinclair. Cell Pathways has not generated any
revenues from the sale of its own products to date, nor is there any assurance
of any future product revenues from the development of its products. Cell
Pathways' intended products are subject to long development cycles and there is
no assurance Cell Pathways will be able to successfully develop, manufacture,
obtain regulatory approval for or market its products. During the period
required to develop its products, Cell Pathways had planned to continue to
finance operations through debt and equity financings, profits from the sale of
Gelclair(TM) and corporate alliances. Management believes that Cell Pathways'
existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million as of December 31, 2002 will
be adequate to sustain operations through the second quarter of 2003, based on
projected revenue and expenditures. As discussed, in February 2003, Cell
Pathways entered into the merger agreement with OSI whereby, if adopted by the
Cell Pathways stockholders, Cell Pathways will be acquired by OSI. The merger is
subject to approval by the Cell Pathways stockholders and certain other
customary conditions. There is no assurance that the merger will be approved by
the Cell Pathways stockholders or that other conditions will be satisfied. If
the merger should not occur, there is no assurance that additional funding will
be available on terms acceptable to Cell Pathways, if at all, or that profits
will be generated from the sale of Gelclair(TM). Cell Pathways will likely be
considered to be in the development stage until, if ever, Cell Pathways receives
approval for, and generates revenues from, the marketing and selling of one or
more of its pharmaceutical drug candidates, or generates significant revenues
from its marketing and selling of products made by others, such as Gelclair(TM).

     On November 3, 1998, Cell Pathways completed a financing through the
acquisition of Tseng Labs, Inc. (a publicly held company with no continuing
operations) in which Cell Pathways issued to the Tseng stockholders
approximately 5.5 million shares of the Cell Pathways common stock and received
net proceeds of approximately $26.4 million (See Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements of Cell Pathways included in this proxy
statement/prospectus). The consolidated financial statements of Cell Pathways
included in this proxy statement/prospectus include the accounts of Cell
Pathways from inception (August 10, 1990) and the accounts of Tseng after
November 3, 1998.

     In July 2000, Cell Pathways entered into an exclusive marketing and
promotion agreement with Aventis to market Nilandron(R) (nilutamide) to
urologists in the United States and Puerto Rico for use in patients who suffer
from prostate cancer. Cell Pathways began to market and promote Nilandron(R) in
September 2000 through the use of a dedicated third party sales force. Under the
terms of the Nilandron(R) agreement, Cell Pathways was responsible for its
marketing and promotion expenses and received from Aventis a percentage of the
gross margin on Aventis' sales in excess of a pre-established gross margin
threshold, if any. The Nilandron(R) agreement with Aventis terminated in October
2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Cell Pathways recognized revenue
under the Nilandron(R) agreement of $611,264 related to the results of the
marketing efforts.

     In January 2002, Cell Pathways entered into a ten-year exclusive
distribution agreement with Sinclair to promote and distribute Gelclair(TM) in
North America (the United States, Canada and Mexico). Gelclair(TM) is an oral
gel care formulation for the management and relief of pain associated with
inflammation and ulceration of the mouth caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy
treatments and other causes. In June 2002, Cell Pathways began to promote
Gelclair(TM) in the oncology market. Cell Pathways purchases Gelclair(TM) from
Sinclair and resells to wholesale customers in the United States.

     In October 2002, Cell Pathways signed a three-year agreement with Celgene
to co-promote Gelclair(TM) in oncology markets and markets other than the dental
market in the United States. Celgene has an oncology field sales force in excess
of 90 representatives. Celgene commenced field sales promotional efforts in mid-
November 2002. Cell Pathways terminated its own sales force in the fourth
quarter of 2002. Celgene will receive a fixed percentage of net sales of
Gelclair(TM) in the oncology and other markets.

     In August 2002, Cell Pathways signed a four-year exclusive agreement with
Butler to market and, to a limited extent, distribute Gelclair(TM) to the dental
market in the United States and, if and when approved for sale, in Canada.
Butler is a leading international supplier of oral health care products. Butler
commenced its launch of Gelclair(TM) in the dental market in the United States
in the fourth quarter of 2002.

     In October 2002, Cell Pathways implemented a restructuring of its work
force eliminating 20% of its staff and reducing its efforts in research,
discovery and pre-clinical development of earlier-stage compounds, and upon
signing the agreement with Celgene to promote Gelclair(TM) in the U.S. oncology
market, eliminated its 16 person sales force and terminated its agreement with
Aventis to promote Nilandron(R). A further reduction of approximately 15% of the
Cell Pathways work-force occurred in late February 2003. Both the work force
reductions and elimination of the sales force were for the purpose of decreasing
future expenses by approximately $2.6 million annually. If the merger with OSI
does not occur, Cell Pathways will need to take appropriate steps to further
reduce the workforce, reduce, eliminate or delay research and development
programs and reduce overall expenditures until appropriate sources of funding
are available, if ever, on terms acceptable to Cell Pathways. As of December 31,
2002, Cell Pathways had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of
$141,155,959.

     In January 2003, Cell Pathways received notification from Nasdaq that its
stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market because Cell Pathways'
stock price fell below the minimum bid requirements and thereby failed to comply
with Nasdaq marketplace rules. Cell Pathways appealed the delisting notification
and has attended a hearing with Nasdaq on February 27, 2003.

     In February 2003, Cell Pathways entered into the merger agreement with OSI
whereby OSI would acquire Cell Pathways in a stock-for-stock transaction. Under
the terms of the merger agreement, Cell Pathways will merge with a subsidiary of
OSI and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI. OSI will exchange 0.0567 shares
of OSI common stock for each outstanding share of Cell Pathways common stock.
OSI will also provide additional consideration in the form of a five-year
contingent value right through which each outstanding share of Cell Pathways
common stock will be eligible for an additional 0.04 share of OSI common stock
in the event an NDA for either Aptosyn(R) or CP461 is accepted for filing by the
FDA. If the merger agreement is adopted by the Cell Pathways stockholders and
the other conditions are satisfied, it is anticipated that the merger will be
closed in the second quarter of 2003.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared with Year Ended December 31,
2001.  Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
$1,148,137 and $942,231, respectively, which represented an increase of $205,906
in 2002 due to the recognition of revenue from sales of Gelclair(TM) of
$536,873, offset by a decrease of $330,967 in Nilandron(R) revenues in 2002.
Product sales of Gelclair(TM) to Cell Pathways' wholesale customers were
initiated in the United States in June 2002. Cell Pathways defers the
recognition of revenue on product shipments of Gelclair(TM) to wholesale
customers until such time that the product is prescribed to the end user. At
each reporting period, Cell Pathways monitors shipments from wholesale customers
to pharmacies and hospitals, wholesale customer reorder history and
prescriptions filled by pharmacies based on prescription data from external,
independent sources. When this data indicates a flow of product through the
supply chain, which indicates that returns are less likely to occur, product
revenue is recognized. For the year ended December 31, 2002, shipments to
wholesale customers were $2,029,219, of which $536,873 has been recognized as
product revenues with the balance recorded as deferred revenue in Cell Pathways'
consolidated balance sheet included in this proxy statement/prospectus. For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, marketing service revenues from the
promotion of Nilandron(R) were $611,264 and $942,231, respectively. In October
2002, the agreement with Aventis related to Cell Pathways' marketing and
promotion of Nilandron(R)

was terminated which resulted in no revenue related to the Nilandron(R)
agreement in the fourth quarter of 2002.

     Total operating expenses, including cost of products sold, for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $19,320,196 and $34,013,371, respectively,
a decrease of $14,693,175. The decrease in 2002 resulted primarily from the
recognition of a non-cash reduction of litigation settlement expense of
$6,749,000 in 2002 as compared to litigation expense of $8,492,000 in 2001,
related to Cell Pathways' settlement of the securities class action litigation,
which was approved by the court in September 2002. The 2002 adjustment to the
litigation expense of $6,749,000, represents the change in the fair value of 1.7
million shares of Cell Pathways common stock issued as part of the settlement
and previously recorded by Cell Pathways in 2001. Excluding both the litigation
settlement expense of $8,492,000 in 2001 and the non-cash reduction of
litigation settlement expense of $6,749,000 in 2002, total operating expenses
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 would have been $26,069,196 and
$25,521,371, respectively, representing an increase in 2002 of $547,825 or 2.1%
from the same period in 2001.

     Cost of products sold, related to the sales of Gelclair(TM), for the year
ended December 31, 2002 was $219,706 or 40.9% of product revenues. There was no
cost of products sold in 2001 since Cell Pathways began selling Gelclair(TM) in
June 2002.

     Research and development, or R&D, expenses for the year ended December 31,
2002 were $17,145,109, a decrease of $620,134 or 3.5% from the same period in
2001. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in pre-clinical study
expenses of approximately $1,230,000 for CP461, as most of the pre-clinical
studies related to CP461 were completed in 2001, and a reduction in personnel
related expenses of approximately $765,000 including stock option expense for
certain scientific advisory board members due to a decline in Cell Pathways'
stock price in 2002. Partially offsetting these decreases in R&D expenses was an
increase in clinical trial expenses of approximately $1,390,000 associated with
Cell Pathways' Phase III clinical trial of Aptosyn(R) in combination with
Taxotere(R) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and the advancement of
CP461 in pilot clinical trials in various cancer indications.

     Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2002 were $8,704,381, an increase of $948,253, or 12.2%, from the
same period in 2001. This increase was primarily due to an increase in promotion
and distribution expenses for Gelclair(TM) of approximately $685,000 and an
increase in consulting expenses of approximately $544,000 to assist Cell
Pathways in its strategic and financing activities. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in personnel expenses of approximately $335,000
due in part to reductions in staff and the non-payment of bonuses in 2002.

     Interest income, net of interest expense of $63,664, was $300,837 for the
year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $1,365,868 from the same period of
2001, due to lower average cash balances and lower average interest rates on
investments.

     Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31,
2000.  Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000
related to the Nilandron(R) agreement were $942,231 and $329,694, respectively.
Cell Pathways began promoting Nilandron(R) to urologists in September 2000.

     Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, including a
litigation charge of $8,492,000, were $34,013,371, an increase of $4,508,984 or
15.3% from the same period in 2000.

     R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $17,765,243, a
decrease of $4,492,562 or 20.2% from the same period in 2000. This decrease was
primarily due to reductions in 2001 of purchases of research materials for
Aptosyn(R) of approximately $5,556,000 offset partially by increases in clinical
development expenses of approximately $1,020,000 .

     SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $7,756,128, an
increase of $509,546 or 7.0% from the same period in 2000. This increase was
primarily due to higher personnel expenses of approximately $982,000 and a full
year's marketing expenses for Nilandron(R) in 2001 versus four months of
activity for the year ended December 31, 2000 representing an increase of
approximately $890,000 as a result of the launch of

Nilandron(R) in September 2000, offset partially by a reduction in
pre-commercialization expenses for Aptosyn(R) in 2001 of approximately
$1,330,000.

     In February 2002, Cell Pathways reached an agreement in principle to settle
its class action litigation. The December 31, 2001 financial statements include
a charge of $8,492,000 for the settlement of this litigation and related
expenses. The agreement required Cell Pathways to issue 1.7 million shares of
its common stock and to pay $2.0 million in cash. In connection with the
settlement, Cell Pathways' insurance company agreed to pay $2.0 million to Cell
Pathways. The litigation charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001
represented the fair value of the 1.7 million shares to be issued and estimated
legal costs of $655,000. Until such time as the settlement was approved by the
court, Cell Pathways adjusted the value of the 1.7 million shares based on the
then current fair value of the shares. Such adjustments resulted in a non-cash
reduction in litigation expense in subsequent interim periods and for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

     Interest income, net of interest expense of $103,883, for the year ended
December 31, 2001, was $1,666,705, a decrease of $591,180 or 26.2% from the same
period in 2000, primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower interest
rates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Cell Pathways has financed its operations since inception primarily with
the net proceeds received from the sale of equity securities, including the
transaction with Tseng. Financing activities have generated net proceeds of
$151.0 million from inception through December 31, 2002.

     As of December 31, 2002, Cell Pathways had cash and cash equivalents of
$10,920,335, a decrease of $16,793,580 from the balances of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2001. This decrease was
primarily the result of cash used to fund operations for the year ended December
31, 2002, $2.4 million in inventory purchases and a $1.0 million payment to
Sinclair for the licensing rights to market Gelclair(TM). Partially offsetting
the cash used in 2002 was a total of $10.6 million of cash received from a
private placement of approximately 2.4 million shares of Cell Pathways' common
stock and a registered direct offering of approximately 4.0 million shares of
Cell Pathways' common stock. Cell Pathways invests its excess cash primarily in
low risk, highly liquid money market funds and U.S. government securities with
original maturities of less than three months. As of December 31, 2002, Cell
Pathways had $468,233 in a restricted cash account pledged for a security
deposit under the lease of its Horsham, Pennsylvania facility.

     In September 2002, Cell Pathways sold 4,036,001 shares of its common stock
in a registered direct offering at the price of $0.70 per share, resulting in
the net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million. In addition to a placement fee,
the placement agent received warrants to purchase 80,720 shares of Cell
Pathways' common stock at a price of $0.84 per share. The warrants are
exercisable until September 2008.

     In March 2002, Cell Pathways sold 2,390,107 shares of its common stock in a
private placement, primarily to institutional investors, at a price of $3.70 per
share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $8.0 million. With each four
shares of Cell Pathways' common stock purchased, Cell Pathways issued a warrant
to purchase one share of Cell Pathways' common stock at $4.74 per share. The
warrants are exercisable until March 2006.

     During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Cell Pathways made
loans of $54,000, $256,000 and $632,954, respectively, to two of its officers
that were outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The loans, including accrued
interest, are repayable five years from the date of issuance. During 2002, Cell
Pathways recorded an allowance of $114,742 against one of the officer's loans.

     In 2002, Cell Pathways purchased $231,877 in laboratory, computer and
office equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements for its research
laboratories and offices in its Horsham facility.

     Cell Pathways leases approximately 40,000 square feet of laboratory and
office space in Horsham, Pennsylvania under a ten-year lease which expires in
2008 and which contains two, five-year renewal options. Cell Pathways believes
its facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future.

     In March, April and May 2001, eleven stockholder class actions were filed
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
against Cell Pathways and certain of its officers and directors seeking
unspecified damages. The lawsuits alleged that Cell Pathways and its officers
made false and misleading statements about Cell Pathways' drug candidate,
Aptosyn(R), which caused artificial inflation of Cell Pathways' stock price
during the class period of October 27, 1999 to September 22, 2000, when Cell
Pathways announced that the FDA had informed Cell Pathways that it would be
receiving a "not approvable" letter for its NDA for Aptosyn(R). In February
2002, the parties agreed upon a stipulation of settlement. Pursuant to this
stipulation of settlement, and following a preliminary order by the court, Cell
Pathways' insurance carrier paid $2.0 million into escrow and Cell Pathways
issued 1.7 million shares of common stock into escrow. On September 23, 2002,
following a hearing, the court entered a final order approving the settlement
and dismissing the action at which time the $2.0 million and 1.7 million shares
of common stock were released from escrow. The time to appeal has expired. As of
December 31, 2001, Cell Pathways recorded the fair value of the 1.7 million
shares of Cell Pathways' common stock of $7,837,000, as an increase to
additional paid-in capital and recorded a charge to litigation settlement
expense for the then fair value of Cell Pathways' common stock. As of September
23, 2002, the fair value of the 1.7 million shares was adjusted to $1,088,000
based on the final fair value of the shares as of September 23, 2002, which
resulted in a $6,749,000 total reduction to the litigation settlement expense
and a decrease to additional paid-in capital for the year ended December 31,
2002.

     Under the Gelclair(TM) agreement, in the first quarter ended March 31,
2002, Cell Pathways paid Sinclair $1.0 million for the exclusive right to market
and distribute Gelclair(TM) in North America and $2.0 million for inventory
purchases. Cell Pathways committed to additional inventory purchases, as amended
in October 2002 of $4.7 million and $5.0 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively,
and annual marketing expenditures of $750,000, $500,000 and $250,000 for 2003
through 2006, 2007 through 2008 and 2009 through 2011, respectively. In
addition, Cell Pathways is obligated to spend $1.3 million annually for direct
sales force efforts. Cell Pathways has agreements with Celgene and Butler that
satisfy this obligation through 2006. Cell Pathways could be responsible for
milestone payments totaling $3.0 million related to the achievement of certain
sales, patent and clinical trial milestones.

     In January 2003, Cell Pathways received notification from Nasdaq that its
common stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market because its share
price fell below the minimum bid requirements and thereby failed to comply with
Nasdaq marketplace rules. Cell Pathways appealed the delisting notification and
attended a hearing with Nasdaq on February 27, 2003. On March 21, 2003, Cell
Pathways was informed that its common stock will continue to be listed on the
Nasdaq National Market until June 30, 2003 in order to allow consummation of the
merger, provided Cell Pathways complies with all of the requirements for
continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market with the exception of the
minimum bid requirement. If Cell Pathways' common stock is delisted, the
liquidity of Cell Pathways' common stock could be impaired, and Cell Pathways'
efforts to raise additional capital could be adversely impacted.

     Cell Pathways believes, based on its current operating plan, that its
existing cash and cash equivalents balance of $10.9 million as of December 31,
2002, together with interest earned on these balances, will be adequate to
sustain operations through the second quarter of 2003. If the merger with OSI
does not occur, Cell Pathways would take appropriate steps to further reduce
expenses and eliminate or delay research and development programs until
appropriate sources of funding are available, if ever, on terms acceptable to
Cell Pathways. There is no assurance that the transaction with OSI will be
approved by the Cell Pathways stockholders. Should the transaction not be
approved by the Cell Pathways stockholders, there is no assurance that
additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to Cell Pathways, if at
all. These factors raise substantial doubt about Cell Pathways' ability to
continue as a going concern. The Cell Pathways consolidated financial statements
included in this proxy statement/prospectus do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

INFLATION

     Cell Pathways does not believe that inflation has had any significant
impact on its business to date.

INCOME TAXES

     As of December 31, 2002, Cell Pathways had net operating loss
carryforwards, or NOLs, for income tax purposes available to offset future
federal income tax, subject to limitations for alternative minimum tax. In
addition, Cell Pathways has other significant deferred tax assets that will also
offset future income tax. As Cell Pathways has not yet achieved profitable
operations, management believes the tax assets do not satisfy the realization
criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes" and therefore Cell Pathways has recorded a valuation allowance for
the entire amount of its net tax asset as of December 31, 2002.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that may limit the NOLs
available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events,
including significant changes in ownership interest. A change in ownership of a
company greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual
limitation on Cell Pathways' ability to utilize its NOLs from tax periods prior
to the ownership change. Cell Pathways believes that the transaction with Tseng
triggered such limitation. In addition, the merger of Cell Pathways by OSI would
trigger an additional limitation. The annual limitation triggered by the
proposed OSI transaction could result in a significant portion of Cell Pathways'
NOLs expiring.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations". SFAS No. 143 requires Cell Pathways to record the fair value of an
asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets
that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use
of the assets. Cell Pathways also records a corresponding asset that is
depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of
the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted at the end of
each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future
cash flows underlying the obligation. Cell Pathways was required to adopt SFAS
No. 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have
a material effect on Cell Pathways' financial statements.

     In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections." SFAS No. 145 amends existing guidance on reporting gains and
losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain
or loss as extraordinary, as the use of such extinguishments have become part of
the risk management strategy of many companies. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS
No. 13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that
have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The adoption of
SFAS No. 145 is not expected to have a material effect on Cell Pathways'
financial statements.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies EITF Issue 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity." The provisions of
SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS
No. 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the Cell Pathways'
financial statements.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57 and
107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34." This Interpretation
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The
Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on Cell Pathways'
financial statements.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123." SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 123 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements of Cell Pathways included in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51." This
Interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable
interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. The Interpretation applies
immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003, and to variable interests in variable interest entities
obtained after January 31, 2003. The application of this Interpretation is not
expected to have a material effect on Cell Pathways' financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which was released by the SEC, requires
all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods
used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 3 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements of Cell Pathways included in this proxy
statement/ prospectus includes a summary of its significant accounting policies
and methods used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
While the preparation of Cell Pathways' consolidated financial statements
requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period, Cell Pathways does not believe its financial
statements are significantly affected by complex accounting policies and
methods, given its stage of development.

  Revenue Recognition

     Product sales of Gelclair(TM) to Cell Pathways' wholesale customers were
initiated in the United States in June 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 48,
"Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists", Cell Pathways defers the
recognition of revenue on product shipments of Gelclair(TM) to wholesale
customers until such time that the product is prescribed to the end user. At
each reporting period, Cell Pathways monitors shipments from wholesale customers
to pharmacies and hospitals, wholesale customer reorder history and
prescriptions filled by pharmacies based on prescription data from external,
independent sources. When this data indicates a flow of product through the
supply chain, which indicates that returns are less likely to occur, product
revenue is recognized.

  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

     Cell Pathways evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever
indicators of impairment exist. Cell Pathways' history of negative operating
cash flows are an indicator of impairment. Accounting standards require that if
the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company's long-lived
asset, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the reported
value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial
statements. The amount of impairment Cell Pathways would be required to
recognize would be calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from
the reported value of the asset.

     As of December 31, 2002, Cell Pathways' long-lived assets consist of
product distribution rights related to Gelclair(TM) with a carrying value of
$908,333 and equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements with a carrying
value of $785,766. Cell Pathways' assumptions underlying the estimate of cash
flows require significant judgment because Cell Pathways has limited experience
with product sales of Gelclair(TM) and a history of negative operating cash
flows. As of December 31, 2002, Cell Pathways estimates that its future cash
flows on an undiscounted basis, related to product sales of Gelclair(TM) are
greater than the current carrying value of the product distribution rights. Any
decreases in estimated future cash flows could have an impact on

the carrying value of the product distribution rights. Cell Pathways' equipment,
furniture and leasehold improvements have been recorded at cost and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those
assets. Cell Pathways believes the remaining carrying value of equipment,
furniture and leasehold improvements does not exceed its estimated fair value.

  Going Concern Assumption

     Cell Pathways has incurred negative cash flows from operations since
inception and, as of December 31, 2002 had a deficit accumulated during the
development stage of $141,155,959. Management believes Cell Pathways' cash and
cash equivalents as of December 31, 2002 of $10,920,335 will be adequate to
sustain operations through the second quarter of 2003. These factors raise
substantial doubt about Cell Pathways' ability to continue as a going concern.
Cell Pathways' consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Should Cell Pathways be
unable to continue as a going concern, the amounts to be realized from Cell
Pathways' assets and liabilities that would be incurred could differ from the
amounts reported.

COMMITMENTS

     As outlined in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements of Cell Pathways included in this proxy statement/prospectus, Cell
Pathways has entered into various contractual obligations and commercial
commitments. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2002:

                         LESS THAN      1 TO 3        4 TO 5      AFTER 5

                         ==========   ===========   ==========   ==========   ===========

     In addition to the above purchase commitments for Gelclair(TM), Cell
Pathways is obligated to spend $1.3 million annually for direct sales force
efforts. This obligation is satisfied by Cell Pathways' agreements with Celgene
and Butler through 2006. Cell Pathways could also be responsible for milestone
payments totalling $3 million related to the achievement of certain sales,
patent and clinical trial milestones.

     Under certain circumstances, including if the Cell Pathways Board of
Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation to the Cell Pathways
stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, Cell Pathways will be required to
pay to OSI a termination fee of $1,250,000.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

     Cell Pathways does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements.

DIVIDEND POLICY

     OSI has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock. OSI
currently intends to retain earnings, if any, to support the development of its
business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable
future. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the
OSI Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including its
financial condition, operating results and current and anticipated cash needs.

     Cell Pathways has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does
not expect to pay cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

 OSI

     On September 27, 2000, the Board of Directors of OSI adopted a shareholder
rights plan, declared a dividend distribution of one Series SRPA Junior
Participating Preferred Stock Purchase Right on each outstanding share of its
common stock, and authorized the redemption of the rights issued pursuant to
OSI's then current shareholder rights plan. OSI distributed rights to all
shareholders of record at the close of business on September 27, 2000, the
record date. These rights entitle the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a
share of Series SRP Junior Participating Preferred Stock upon a triggering event
as discussed below.

     Upon the actual acquisition of 17.5% or more of the outstanding common
stock of OSI by a person or group, the rights held by all holders other than the
acquiring person or group will be modified automatically to be rights to
purchase shares of common stock (instead of rights to purchase preferred stock)
at 50% of the then market value of such common stock. Furthermore, the
rightholders will have the further right to purchase shares of common stock at
the same discount if OSI merges with, or sells 50% or more of its assets or
earning power to, the acquiring person or group or any person acting for or with
the acquiring person or group. If the transaction takes the form of a merger of
OSI into another corporation, these rightholders will have the right to acquire
at the same percentage discount shares of common stock of the acquiring person
or other ultimate parent of such merger party.

     OSI can redeem the rights at any time before (but not after) a person has
acquired 17.5% or more of the OSI common stock, with certain exceptions. The
rights will expire on August 31, 2010 if not redeemed prior to such date.

 Cell Pathways

     On December 3, 1998, the Board of Directors of Cell Pathways adopted a
stockholder rights plan. Under the plan, rights to purchase stock, at a rate of
one right for each outstanding share of Cell Pathways common stock, were
distributed to holders of record on December 15, 1998 and automatically attach
to shares issued

thereafter. Under the plan, the rights attach to Cell Pathways common stock and
are not represented by separate rights certificates until, and generally become
exercisable only after, a person or group (i) acquires 15% or more of Cell
Pathways outstanding common stock or (ii) commences a tender offer that would
result in such a person or group owning 15% or more of Cell Pathways outstanding
common stock. When the rights first become exercisable, a holder will be
entitled to buy from Cell Pathways a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Cell Pathways at a
purchase price of $90. However, if any person acquires 15% or more of Cell
Pathways outstanding common stock other than pursuant to a qualified offer, each
right not owned by a 15% or more stockholder would become exercisable for Cell
Pathways common stock (or in certain circumstances, other consideration) having
a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the right. The rights expire
on December 14, 2008, except as otherwise provided in the plan. The stockholder
rights plan was amended in February 2003 to make it inapplicable to OSI in
connection with the merger. There are currently no shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock outstanding.

                                    EXPERTS

     The consolidated financial statements of OSI and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2002 and 2001 and for each of the years in the three-year period
ended September 30, 2002, have been incorporated by reference herein and in the
registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part, in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP, independent accountants,
incorporated by reference herein, and upon the authority of said firm as experts
in accounting and auditing. The report covering the September 30, 2002
consolidated financial statements refers to a change in the method of revenue
recognition for certain upfront, non-refundable fees in 2001; the adoption of
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business
Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", for
acquisitions consummated on or after July 1, 2001; and the adoption of the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 "Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections" relating to the classification of the effect of early
debt extinguishments in 2002.

     The financial statements of the Oncology Related Assets, Liabilities and
Activities of Gilead Sciences, Inc. appearing in OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s
Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on March 6, 2002, have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors,
as set forth in their report thereon included therein and incorporated herein by
reference in this proxy statement/ prospectus and elsewhere in the registration
statement. Such financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in
reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in
accounting and auditing.

     The consolidated financial statements of Cell Pathways as of December 31,
2002 and for the year then ended and for the period from August 10, 1990
(inception) through December 31, 2002, have been included and incorporated by
reference herein and elsewhere in the registration statement on Form S-4 of
which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, in reliance upon the report
of KPMG LLP, independent accountants, appearing elsewhere and incorporated by
reference herein, and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting
and auditing. The audit report covering Cell Pathways' December 31, 2002
consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph that states
that Cell Pathways' recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit and
limited liquid resources raise substantial doubt about Cell Pathways' ability to
continue as a going concern. Cell Pathways' consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of that
uncertainty.

     The consolidated financial statements of Cell Pathways as of December 31,
2001 and each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2001 and
for the period from August 10, 1990 (inception) through December 31, 2001
included and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and
elsewhere in the registration statement have been audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP, independent auditors. Because Arthur Andersen LLP has ceased conducting
business, a consent to use their report on such financial statements in this
proxy statement/prospectus cannot be obtained. Accordingly, Arthur Andersen's
consent has been omitted in reliance upon SEC rules, which permit OSI and Cell
Pathways to dispense with the requirement to file the written consent of Arthur
Andersen LLP under the circumstances. Since Arthur Andersen LLP has not
consented to the use of their report in this proxy statement/prospectus, you
will not be able to recover against Arthur Andersen LLP under Section 11 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for any untrue statements of a material fact
contained in the financial statements of Cell Pathways audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP or for any omission to state a material fact required to be stated
in those financial statements.

                   FUTURE CELL PATHWAYS STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     The 2003 annual meeting of the stockholders of Cell Pathways will be held
only if the merger agreement is not adopted. The deadline for submission of
stockholder proposals for inclusion in Cell Pathways' proxy materials for the
2003 annual meeting was December 23, 2002.

     In accordance with Cell Pathways' by-laws, notice relating to nominations
for director or proposed business to be considered at the 2003 annual meeting of
the stockholders of Cell Pathways must be given no earlier than February 28,
2003 and no later than March 30, 2003. The notice must meet certain other
requirements set forth in Cell Pathways' by-laws. These requirements do not
affect the procedures for submitting stockholder proposals for inclusion in the
proxy statement, nor do they apply to questions a stockholder may wish to ask at
the meeting.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

     Neither OSI nor Cell Pathways presently intends to bring before the Cell
Pathways special meeting any matters other than those specified in the notice
accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus, and neither OSI nor Cell Pathways
has any knowledge of any other matters which may be brought up by other persons.
However, if any other matters come before the Cell Pathways special meeting or
any adjournments of the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of
proxy, including any substitutes, will use their best judgment to vote the
proxies.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Cell Pathways, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cell
Pathways, Inc. (a development stage company) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity (deficit) and partners' investment and cash flows for the year then
ended, and for the period from August 10, 1990 (inception) through December 31,
2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Cell
Pathways, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the
years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2001 and for the period from
August 10, 1990 (inception) through December 31, 2002, to the extent related to
the period from August 10, 1990 (inception) through December 31, 2001, were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed
an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report dated
February 25, 2002. Our opinion on the consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity (deficit) and partners' investment and cash flows, insofar
as it relates to the amounts included for the period from August 10, 1990
(inception) through December 31, 2001, is based solely on the report of the
other auditors.

     We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the
2002 consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cell Pathways, Inc. (a development
stage company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, and for the
period from August 10, 1990 (inception) through December 31, 2002, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring
losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit and has limited liquid
resources that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in
Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                      CELL PATHWAYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               DECEMBER 31, 2002

1.  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

     Cell Pathways, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in July 1998 as a
subsidiary of, and as of November 3, 1998 successor to, a Delaware corporation
of the same name. As the context requires, "Company", is used herein to signify
the successor and/or the predecessor corporations (See Note 4).

     The Company is a development stage pharmaceutical company focused on the
research and development of products to treat and prevent cancer, and the future
commercialization of such products. The Company also markets and sells
Gelclair(TM) Concentrated Oral Gel ("Gelclair(TM)") manufactured by Sinclair
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of the United Kingdom ("Sinclair"). The Company has not
generated any revenues from the sale of its own products to date, nor is there
any assurance of any future product revenues from the development of its
products. The Company's intended products are subject to long development cycles
and there is no assurance the Company will be able to successfully develop,
manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or market its products. During the
period required to develop its products, the Company had planned to continue to
finance operations through debt and equity financings, profits from the sale of
Gelclair(TM) and corporate alliances. The Company will continue to be considered
in the development stage until such time, if ever, as it generates significant
revenues from one or more of its product candidates. In October 2002, the
Company implemented a restructuring of its work force eliminating 20% of its
staff and reducing its efforts in research, discovery and pre-clinical
development of earlier-stage compounds, and subsequently, upon signing an
agreement with Celgene Corporation ("Celgene") to promote Gelclair(TM) in the
U.S. oncology market, eliminated its 16 person sales force and subsequently
terminated its agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Aventis") to
promote Nilandron(R)(nilutamide). Both the restructuring and elimination of the
sales force are expected to decrease expenses in the future.

     On November 3, 1998, the Company completed a financing through the
acquisition of Tseng Labs, Inc. ("Tseng") (a publicly held company with no
continuing operations) in which the Company issued to Tseng stockholders
approximately 5.5 million shares of the Company's Common Stock and received net
proceeds of approximately $26.4 million (See Note 4). The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company from
inception (August 10, 1990) and the accounts of Tseng after November 3, 1998.

     In July 2000, the Company entered into an exclusive marketing and promotion
agreement (the "Nilandron(R) Agreement") with Aventis to market Nilandron(R) to
urologists in the U. S. and Puerto Rico for use in patients who suffer from
prostate cancer. The Company began to market and promote Nilandron(R) in
September 2000 through the use of a dedicated third party sales force. Under the
terms of the Nilandron(R) Agreement, the Company was responsible for its
marketing and promotion expenses and received from Aventis a percentage of the
gross margin on Aventis' sales in excess of a pre-established gross margin
threshold, if any. The Company's agreement with Aventis terminated in October
2002.

     In January 2002, the Company entered into a ten-year exclusive distribution
agreement (the "Gelclair(TM) Agreement") with Sinclair to promote and distribute
Gelclair(TM) in North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico). Gelclair(TM) is an oral
gel care formulation for the management and relief of pain associated with
inflammation and ulceration of the mouth caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy
treatments and other causes. In June 2002, the Company began to promote
Gelclair(TM) in the oncology market. The Company purchases Gelclair(TM) from
Sinclair and resells to wholesale customers in the U.S.

     In August 2002, the Company entered into a four-year marketing agreement
with John O. Butler Company ("Butler"). Butler markets Gelclair(TM) to the
dental market within the U.S. and will market in Canada if and when Gelclair(TM)
is approved for marketing in Canada. In October 2002, the Company entered

                                       F-14

                      CELL PATHWAYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

into a three-year agreement with Celgene for the promotion of Gelclair(TM) in
the U.S. oncology or other markets.

     In January 2003, the Company received notification from Nasdaq that the
Company's stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market because the
Company's stock price fell below the minimum bid requirements and thereby failed
to comply with Nasdaq marketplace rules. The Company has appealed the delisting
notification and has requested a hearing with Nasdaq which is scheduled for
February 2003.

     In February 2003, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger
with OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("OSI Pharmaceuticals") whereby OSI
Pharmaceuticals would acquire the Company in a stock-for-stock transaction. If
approved by the Company's stockholders, OSI Pharmaceuticals will exchange .0567
shares of OSI Pharmaceuticals common stock for every share of Cell Pathways'
Common Stock upon closing of the transaction. OSI Pharmaceuticals will also
provide additional consideration in the form of a five-year contingent value
right ("CVR") through which each share of Cell Pathways' Common Stock held by
stockholders of record on the date of the merger closure will be eligible for an
additional .040 share of OSI Pharmaceuticals common stock in the event a new
drug application for either Aptosyn(R) (exisulind) or CP461 is accepted for
filing by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") within five years. If
approved by the Company's stockholders, it is anticipated that the merger will
be closed in the second quarter of 2003.

2.  GOING CONCERN:

     The Company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since
inception and, as of December 31, 2002, the Company had a deficit accumulated
during the development stage of $141,155,959. Management believes that the
Company's existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund operations
through the second quarter of 2003, based on projected revenue and expenditure
levels. Should appropriate sources of funding not be available on terms
acceptable to the Company, management would take additional actions which could
include a further reduction in workforce, a reduction in overall expenditures
and the delay or elimination of certain clinical trials and research activities
until such time as appropriate sources of funding are available. In February
2003, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with OSI
Pharmaceuticals whereby, if approved by the Company's stockholders, the Company
would be acquired by OSI Pharmaceuticals. There is no assurance, however, that
the transaction with OSI Pharmaceuticals will be approved by the Company's
stockholders. Should the transaction not be approved by the Company's
stockholders, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available on
terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, to enable the Company to continue
operations.

     These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

  MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of

                                       F-15

                      CELL PATHWAYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such
estimates.

  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH

     For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
approximately $468,000 and $463,000, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents
were restricted to secure letters of credit for security deposits on the
Company's leases.

  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2001 the Company had approximately $24.8 million in
short-term investments invested in U.S. government securities with original
maturities greater than three months at two financial institutions. The Company
classifies its short-term investments as held-to-maturity which are carried on
the accompanying balance sheet at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2001, the
fair value of these short-term investments was $24,905,000.

  CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     For the year ended December 31, 2002, five customers accounted for 93% of
product revenues. As of December 31, 2002, two wholesale customers represented
92% of accounts receivable due from shipments of Gelclair(TM). Credit risk is
controlled through the use of credit limits, credit approvals and periodic
credit evaluations of wholesale customers.

  INVENTORY

     Inventory is comprised solely of Gelclair(TM) and is stated at the lower of
cost or market, as determined using the first-in, first-out method.

  EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

     Equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
Depreciation of equipment and furniture is provided on the straight-line method
over estimated useful lives of two to five years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the life of the related lease.

  PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

     Product distribution rights represents a $1 million payment made to
Sinclair for the exclusive right to market and distribute Gelclair(TM) in North
America. The Company amortizes this up-front payment over the ten-year term of
the distribution agreement. Amortization expense was $91,667 during the year
ended December 31, 2002.

  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued expenses and debt instruments. Management believes the carrying values
of these assets and liabilities are considered to be representative of their
respective fair values.

                      CELL PATHWAYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company recognized revenue for marketing services under the
Nilandron(R) Agreement in the period in which marketing services were performed
if Aventis' sales of Nilandron(R) for that period exceeded specified thresholds.
The Company's agreement with Aventis terminated in October 2002.

     Product sales of Gelclair(TM) to the Company's wholesale customers were
initiated in the U.S. in June 2002. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 48, "Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists", given the limited sales history of Gelclair(TM), the Company, at this
time defers the recognition of revenue on product shipments of Gelclair(TM) to
wholesale customers until such time the product is prescribed to the end user.
At each reporting period, the Company monitors shipments from wholesale
customers to pharmacies and hospitals, wholesale customer reorder history and
prescriptions filled by pharmacies based on prescription data from external,
independent sources. When this data indicates a flow of product through the
supply chain, which indicates that returns are less likely to occur, product
revenue is recognized. For the year ended Dec
