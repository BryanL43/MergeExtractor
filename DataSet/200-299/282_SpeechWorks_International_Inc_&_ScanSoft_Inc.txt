       QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER OF SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

     Q:  WHY ARE SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS PROPOSING THE MERGER?

     A:  We are proposing the merger because we believe the combination of our
two companies will bring together the broadest set of speech technologies,
products and professional services in a diversified organization that is able to
support partners and customers on a global scale more effectively and
efficiently. Furthermore, after reviewing numerous strategic alternatives for
enhancing stockholder value, the boards of directors of both ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks believes that the merger will:

     - broaden our technical strengths and resources to develop and deliver
       enhanced products;

     - strengthen our channel and partner capabilities with an expanded
       portfolio of technologies, applications and services;

     - enhance our competitive position in key vertical markets, including
       telecommunications, travel/ hospitality, financial services, automotive
       and government;

     - allow the combined company to utilize the skill and resources from both
       companies' management and employee teams;

     - provide a professional services organization to help the combined company
       better serve our major enterprise accounts, channel partners and
       telecommunications carriers; and

     - generate cost synergies through headcount reductions, office site
       consolidations and reductions in marketing and administrative expenses.

     Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN PURSUANT TO THE MERGER?

     A:  Pursuant to the merger, a wholly owned subsidiary of ScanSoft will
merge with SpeechWorks and SpeechWorks will survive the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of ScanSoft, and SpeechWorks stockholders will become ScanSoft
stockholders. Assuming the merger had been completed on [            ], the
record date for the SpeechWorks special meeting, SpeechWorks stockholders would
have owned approximately [  ]% of the fully-diluted shares of ScanSoft common
stock after the merger and ScanSoft stockholders would have owned the remaining
[  ]%.

     Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

     A:  We cannot complete the merger unless, among other things, a majority of
the outstanding shares of SpeechWorks common stock entitled to vote at the
SpeechWorks special meeting vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger. As of the SpeechWorks record date, SpeechWorks directors and officers
were entitled to vote approximately [  ]% of the outstanding shares of
SpeechWorks common stock. These directors and officers have already agreed with
ScanSoft to vote their shares of SpeechWorks common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger.

     In addition, a majority of the votes cast at the ScanSoft special meeting
on the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in
connection with the merger must be voted in favor of such issuance in order to
complete the merger. As of the ScanSoft record date, ScanSoft directors and
officers were entitled to vote approximately [  ]% of the outstanding shares of
ScanSoft common stock. These directors and officers have already agreed with
SpeechWorks to vote their shares of ScanSoft common stock in favor of the
issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger.

     Q:  HOW DO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS RECOMMEND
THAT I VOTE?

     A:  The ScanSoft board of directors recommends that ScanSoft stockholders
vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common
stock in connection with the merger.

     The SpeechWorks board of directors recommends that SpeechWorks stockholders
vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

     Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

     A:  We expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible once all the
conditions to the merger, including obtaining the approvals of ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks stockholders, are fulfilled. While we cannot predict the exact
timing, we currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of
calendar year 2003.

     Q:  WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS?

     A:  You can find more information about ScanSoft and SpeechWorks from
reading this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the various sources described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the section entitled "Where You

ScanSoft's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we sometimes refer to as the
1995 ESPP, to increase the number of shares of ScanSoft common stock reserved

conditioned on the approval of the amendment to the 1995 ESPP, and the amendment
to the 1995 ESPP is not conditioned on the completion of the merger.

     A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, please mail your completed and signed
proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope as soon as possible so
that your shares may be represented at the ScanSoft special meeting. In order to

three ways. First, you can complete and send a proxy with a later date. Second,
you can send a written notice to the corporate secretary of ScanSoft stating

State Street, Boston, Massachusetts on [          ], 2003 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern

     Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE SPEECHWORKS SPECIAL MEETING?

     A:  At the SpeechWorks special meeting, SpeechWorks stockholders will be
asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to
approve the merger.

     Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO VOTE?

     A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this joint proxy statement/ prospectus and the other information to which you
have been referred, please mail your completed and signed proxy card in the
enclosed postage-paid return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares
may be represented at the SpeechWorks special meeting. In order to assure that
we obtain your vote, please vote as instructed on your proxy card even if you
currently plan to attend the SpeechWorks special meeting and vote in person.

     If you sign and mail your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote,
your proxy will be voted for the adoption of the merger agreement and the
approval of the merger.

     Q:  MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE EVEN AFTER RETURNING A PROXY CARD?

     A:  Yes. If you want to change your vote, you may do so at any time before
your proxy is voted at the SpeechWorks special meeting. You can do this in one
of three ways. First, you can complete and send a proxy with a later date.
Second, you can send a written notice to the corporate secretary of SpeechWorks
stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Third, you can attend the
SpeechWorks special meeting and vote in person. Your attendance at the
SpeechWorks special meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.

     Q:  IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
SHARES FOR ME?

     A:  No. You should contact your broker. You should follow the directions
provided by your broker to vote your shares. Your broker will not vote your
shares on the merger proposal unless your broker receives appropriate
instructions from you. If you do not provide your broker with voting
instructions, your shares will be considered present at the SpeechWorks special
meeting for purposes of determining a quorum but will not be considered to have
been voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger. As a result, your shares will have the effect of a vote against adoption
of the merger agreement and approval of the merger if you do not give voting
instructions to your broker.

     If you have instructed your broker to vote your shares, you must follow
directions received from your broker to change those instructions. You cannot
vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to
SpeechWorks or by voting in person at the SpeechWorks special meeting.

     Q:  WHAT WILL SPEECHWORKS STOCKHOLDERS BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO
THE MERGER?

     A:  If the merger is completed, SpeechWorks stockholders will be entitled
to receive 0.860 of a share of ScanSoft common stock for each share of
SpeechWorks common stock held at the effective time of the merger. Instead of a
fractional share of ScanSoft common stock, SpeechWorks stockholders will be
entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the fractional share
that the respective SpeechWorks stockholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive after aggregating all of such stockholder's SpeechWorks shares in a
single account, based on the average closing price of ScanSoft common stock as
reported on the NASDAQ National Market.

     SpeechWorks will terminate and cancel all outstanding stock options to
purchase shares of SpeechWorks common stock that are not exercised immediately
before the effective time of the merger.

     ScanSoft will assume all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of
SpeechWorks common stock that are not exercised immediately before the effective
time of the merger. Assumed warrants will become exercisable to purchase shares
of ScanSoft common stock and will generally have the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under the applicable SpeechWorks warrants, except that the
number of shares of ScanSoft common stock subject to such warrants, and the
exercise price of such warrants, will each be adjusted by the exchange ratio.

     Q:  WILL SPEECHWORKS STOCKHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE SCANSOFT COMMON
STOCK THAT THEY RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THE MERGER?

     A:  Yes. The shares of ScanSoft common stock that SpeechWorks stockholders
receive pursuant to the merger will be listed on the NASDAQ National Market
under the symbol "SSFT." Certain persons who are deemed affiliates of
SpeechWorks will be required to comply with Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, if
they sell their shares of ScanSoft common stock received pursuant to the merger.

     Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY SPEECHWORKS STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

     A:  No. If SpeechWorks stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve
the merger, after the merger is completed, ScanSoft will send SpeechWorks
stockholders written instructions, including a letter of transmittal, that will
explain how to exchange SpeechWorks stock certificates for ScanSoft common stock
certificates. Please do not send in any SpeechWorks stock certificates until you
receive these written instructions and the letter of transmittal.

     Q:  AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

     A:  No. You are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

     Q:  WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER?

     A:  Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by ScanSoft
and SpeechWorks of legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as
a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we
refer to as the Internal Revenue Code. Assuming that the merger so qualifies,
you will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on
the exchange of shares of SpeechWorks common stock for shares of ScanSoft common
stock pursuant to the merger, except for any gain or loss attributable to cash
received instead of fractional ScanSoft shares. The tax consequences to you of
the merger will depend on your particular circumstances. You should consult your
tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to
you.

     Q:  ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER?

     A:  Yes. You should consider the risk factors set out in the section
entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page [  ] of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     We propose a merger pursuant to which Spiderman Acquisition Corporation, a
wholly owned subsidiary of ScanSoft, will merge with and into SpeechWorks, and
thereafter will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity. After the merger,
SpeechWorks will be a wholly owned subsidiary of ScanSoft, and SpeechWorks
stockholders will be entitled to become ScanSoft stockholders.

     The terms and conditions of the merger are contained in the merger
agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Please carefully read the merger agreement as it is the
legal document that governs the proposed merger.

connection with the merger and SpeechWorks stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger.

     After careful consideration of numerous factors, the ScanSoft board of

ScanSoft stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the issuance of shares
of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger are satisfied or waived. The merger will become effective when we file a

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks may mutually agree at any time to terminate the
merger agreement without completing the merger, even after receipt of the
requisite approvals of the stockholders of

ScanSoft and SpeechWorks. In addition, either of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks may,
without the consent of the other, terminate the merger agreement in any of the
following circumstances:

     - if the merger is not completed by October 15, 2003, or a later specified
       date if the closing of the merger is delayed by reason of a pending
       acquisition of ScanSoft;

     - if any governmental order, decree or ruling enjoining or prohibiting the
       merger has become final and nonappealable;

     - if the other party breaches the merger agreement in a way that would
       entitle the party seeking to terminate the agreement not to consummate
       the merger and, if permitted by the merger agreement, the breaching party
       does not cure the breach within 30 days;

     - if a material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on the

       merger;

     - withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation that SpeechWorks
       stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger or fails
       to reconfirm its recommendation of the merger following public
       announcement of a third party acquisition proposal;

     - recommends a third party acquisition proposal to SpeechWorks
       stockholders; or

     - fails to recommend against a tender offer or exchange offer that is
       commenced by a third party.

PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE (SEE PAGE   )

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks have each agreed to pay the other party a
termination fee of $6.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances.

SPEECHWORKS PROHIBITED FROM SOLICITING OTHER OFFERS (SEE PAGE   )

     SpeechWorks has agreed that it will not solicit or encourage the initiation
of any inquiries regarding any acquisition proposals by third parties.
SpeechWorks may respond to unsolicited superior acquisition proposals if
required by the SpeechWorks board of directors' fiduciary duties. SpeechWorks
must promptly notify ScanSoft if SpeechWorks receives any other acquisition
proposals.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE   )

     As a condition to ScanSoft entering into the merger agreement, each of
SpeechWorks' executive officers and directors entered into a voting agreement
with ScanSoft in which each has agreed, among other things, to vote his or her
shares of SpeechWorks common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger and against any action that would delay or
prevent the merger and against any alternative transaction. These persons have
the right, as of the SpeechWorks record date, to vote a total of [     ] shares
of SpeechWorks common stock or approximately [     ]% of the outstanding shares
of SpeechWorks common stock as of the SpeechWorks record date. In connection
with the voting agreements, these persons have granted an irrevocable proxy
appointing members of the ScanSoft board of directors, and each of them
individually, as their sole and exclusive attorneys and proxies to vote their
shares in accordance with the terms of the voting agreements.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS
(SEE PAGE   )

     At the close of business on the record date for the ScanSoft special
meeting, directors and executive officers of ScanSoft and their affiliates
beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately [     ]% of the
[     ] shares of ScanSoft common stock outstanding on that date. The vote
required for approval of the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in
connection with the merger is a majority of the votes cast on the matter.

     At the close of business on the record date for the SpeechWorks special
meeting, directors and executive officers of SpeechWorks and certain of their
affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately [     ]%
of the [     ] shares of SpeechWorks common stock outstanding on that date. The
vote required for the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger is a majority of the outstanding shares of SpeechWorks common stock.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     You should be aware that certain ScanSoft and SpeechWorks executive
officers and directors have interests in the merger that may be different from,
or in addition to, interests of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks stockholders generally.
These interests include, among others:

     - existing agreements and new employment agreements with ScanSoft that
       provide, among other things, for severance and other benefits as a result
       of the merger;

     - continued director and officer indemnification and insurance; and

     - acceleration of all SpeechWorks options held by officers and directors
       and the partial acceleration of shares of SpeechWorks restricted common
       stock held by officers.

     In order to eliminate the ongoing compensation expense and limit the number
of outstanding options that would result from SpeechWorks options remaining
outstanding as ScanSoft options after the merger, ScanSoft has required that all
SpeechWorks options be accelerated and, to the extent not exercised, terminated
prior to the closing of the merger. SpeechWorks cannot determine the number of
options that SpeechWorks employees, officers and directors will exercise and,
with respect to the shares of SpeechWorks common stock issued upon exercise,
sell prior to the effective time of the merger. SpeechWorks expects, however,
that all optionholders will exercise their in-the-money options prior to the
closing of the merger and that most optionholders, including SpeechWorks
executive officers and directors, will elect to sell at least the portion of the
shares issued upon exercise as is necessary to recoup the exercise price and pay
any tax liabilities which the optionholder incurs in connection with the option
exercise. In addition, executive officers and directors and other employees may
for personal reasons, including to diversify their investment holdings, elect to
sell some or all of the remaining shares acquired upon exercise of options prior
to the closing of the merger.

     The ScanSoft and SpeechWorks boards of directors were aware of these
interests in approving the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE   )

     Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks of legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. Assuming that the merger so
qualifies, SpeechWorks stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes on the exchange of shares of SpeechWorks common
stock for shares of ScanSoft common stock pursuant to the merger, except for any
gain or loss attributable to cash received instead of fractional shares of
ScanSoft common stock.

THIS TAX TREATMENT MAY NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS, AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT
TO TAXES OTHER THAN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. SPEECHWORKS STOCKHOLDERS ARE
STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL SCANSOFT STOCK (SEE PAGE   )

     SpeechWorks will use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
ScanSoft from each person who may reasonably be deemed to be an affiliate of
SpeechWorks an executed affiliate agreement pursuant to which such affiliate
shall agree to be bound by the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act. ScanSoft will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer
agent with respect to any ScanSoft common stock received pursuant to the merger
by any stockholder of SpeechWorks who may reasonably be deemed to be an
affiliate. The certificates will contain a legend stating that the shares were
issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 applies and may only be transferred
(i) in conformity with Rule 145 or (ii) in accordance with a written opinion of
counsel, reasonably acceptable to ScanSoft, in form and substance that such
transfer is exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
the merger may not be consummated unless certain filings have been submitted to
the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice, or the Antitrust Division, and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. ScanSoft and SpeechWorks filed the appropriate
notification and report forms with the FTC and with the Antitrust Division and
notice of the early termination of the waiting period was received on June 5,
2003.

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions like the proposed merger. At any time before
or after the completion of the merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could
take any action under the antitrust laws that it deems necessary or advisable in
the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or
seeking the divestiture of substantial assets of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks. In
addition, certain private parties, as well as state attorneys general and other
antitrust authorities, may challenge the transaction under antitrust laws under
certain circumstances.

     In addition, the merger may be subject to various foreign antitrust laws.

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks believe that the completion of the merger will not
violate any antitrust laws. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made
that the result will be favorable.

LISTING OF SCANSOFT COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE   )

     ScanSoft will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares
of ScanSoft common stock issued pursuant to the merger to be authorized for
listing on the NASDAQ National Market.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under Delaware law, ScanSoft and SpeechWorks stockholders are not entitled
to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

              COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

     The following table reflects (i) the historical income (loss) from
continuing operations and book value per share of ScanSoft common stock in
comparison with the pro forma loss from continuing operations and book value per
share after giving effect to the acquisition of the Philips Speech Processing
Telephony and Voice Control Division of Royal Philips Electronics N.V. ("PSP")
and to the proposed merger with SpeechWorks; and (ii) the historical loss from
continuing operations and book value per share of SpeechWorks common stock in
comparison with the equivalent pro forma loss from continuing operations and
book value per share. The equivalent pro forma loss from continuing operations
and book value per share are equal to the pro forma loss from continuing
operations and book value per share of ScanSoft, after giving effect to the
acquisition of PSP and to the proposed merger with SpeechWorks, multiplied by
0.860, the number of shares of ScanSoft common stock to be issued in exchange
for each share of SpeechWorks common stock. The comparative historical and pro
forma per share data should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements and related notes thereto and the historical
consolidated financial statements of ScanSoft and notes thereto, included in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the historical consolidated financial
statements of SpeechWorks, which information is incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     The pro forma combined financial data are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results of future operations or the actual results that would have
occurred had the merger been completed at the beginning of the period presented.
The historical book value per common share was calculated by dividing
stockholders' equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at
March 31, 2003. ScanSoft's pro forma combined book value per share was computed
by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of
ScanSoft common stock which would have been outstanding had the merger been
completed as of the balance sheet date.

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks did not declare or pay cash dividends on their
common stock during the year ended December 31, 2002 or during the quarter ended
March 31, 2003. They do not intend to pay dividends on their common stock in the
foreseeable future. See "Comparative Per Share Market Price Data."

(1) Historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity
    by the number of shares of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks common stock outstanding
    at the end of each period. Pro forma book value per share is computed by
    dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of
    ScanSoft common stock outstanding at the end of each period.

(2) The SpeechWorks equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are
    calculated by multiplying ScanSoft combined pro forma share amounts by the
    0.860 exchange ratio for the merger.

                    COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE DATA

     SpeechWorks common stock trades on the NASDAQ National Market under the
symbol "SPWX." ScanSoft common stock trades on the NASDAQ National Market under
the symbol "SSFT."

     The following table shows the high and low prices per share of SpeechWorks
common stock and ScanSoft common stock each as reported on the NASDAQ National
Market on (1) April 23, 2003, the last full trading day preceding public
announcement that ScanSoft and SpeechWorks had entered into the merger
agreement, and (2)           , 2003, the last full trading day for which high
and low prices were available at the time of the printing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

     The table also includes the equivalent high and low price per share of
SpeechWorks common stock on those dates. This equivalent high and low price per
share reflects the fluctuating value of the ScanSoft common stock that
SpeechWorks stockholders would receive in exchange for each share of SpeechWorks
common stock if the merger was completed on either of these dates applying the
exchange ratio of 0.860 shares of ScanSoft common stock for each share of
SpeechWorks common stock exchanged in the merger.

     As of June 13, 2003, there were approximately 310 holders of record of
SpeechWorks common stock.

     The foregoing table shows only historical comparisons. These comparisons
may not provide meaningful information to you in determining whether to adopt
the merger agreement and approve the merger. Because the number of shares of
ScanSoft common stock to be issued for each share of SpeechWorks common stock is
fixed, changes in the market price of ScanSoft common stock will affect the
dollar value of ScanSoft common stock to be received by SpeechWorks stockholders
pursuant to the merger. SpeechWorks stockholders are urged to obtain current
market quotations for ScanSoft common stock and to review carefully the other
information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated
by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus in considering whether
to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. See the section entitled
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page   .

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions, that, if they
never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause the results of ScanSoft, on
the one hand, or SpeechWorks, on the other, to differ materially from those
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements generally are identified by the words "expects," "anticipates,"
"believes," "intends," "estimates," "should," "would," "strategy," "plan" and
similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. For example,
forward-looking statements include projections of earnings, revenues, synergies,
accretion or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and
objectives of management for future operations, including the execution of
integration and restructuring plans and the anticipated timing of filings,
approvals and the closing relating to the merger; any statements concerning
proposed new products, services, developments or industry rankings; any
statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; statements of
belief and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. The
risks, uncertainties and assumptions referred to above include the challenge of
managing asset levels, including inventory; the difficulty of maintaining
expense growth while increasing revenues; the assumption of maintaining revenues
on a combined company basis following the merger; and other risks and
uncertainties described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and in the
documents that are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

     If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or any of these
assumptions proves incorrect, results of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks could differ
materially from the expectations in these statements. The forward-looking
statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are made only as of
the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and neither ScanSoft nor
SpeechWorks is under any obligation to update their respective forward-looking
statements and neither party intends to do so.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     You should carefully consider the risks described below before making your
decision to approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock to
SpeechWorks stockholders, or to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger, as the case may be. The risks and uncertainties described below are not
the only ones facing ScanSoft and SpeechWorks. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are
important to an investor may also harm our respective business operations. If
any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the
following risks actually occur, our respective businesses, financial condition
or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the
trading price of ScanSoft common stock or SpeechWorks common stock could decline
and you may lose part or all of the value of any ScanSoft shares or SpeechWorks
shares held by you.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     By voting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, SpeechWorks
stockholders will be choosing to invest in ScanSoft common stock. In deciding
whether to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, you should
consider all of the information we have included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and its annexes and all of the information included in the
documents SpeechWorks has incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See the sections entitled "Documents Incorporated by
Reference" and "Where You Can Find More Information." Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are
important to an investor may also harm our respective business operations. If
any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the
following risks actually occur, our respective businesses, financial condition
or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the
trading price of ScanSoft common stock or SpeechWorks common stock could decline
and you may lose part or all of the value of any ScanSoft shares or SpeechWorks
shares held by you.

     You should pay particular attention to the following risks relating to the
merger.

  SPEECHWORKS STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATIO OF 0.860 OF A SHARE OF
  SCANSOFT COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON STOCK EXCHANGED IN
  THE MERGER REGARDLESS OF ANY CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON
  STOCK OR SCANSOFT COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of SpeechWorks common stock will
be converted into the right to receive 0.860 of a share of ScanSoft common
stock. The market values of ScanSoft common stock and SpeechWorks common stock
have varied since ScanSoft and SpeechWorks entered into the merger agreement and
will continue to vary in the future due to changes in the business, operations
or prospects of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks, market assessments of the merger,
regulatory considerations, market and economic considerations, and other
factors. The dollar value of ScanSoft common stock that SpeechWorks stockholders
will receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of
ScanSoft common stock at the time of completion of the merger, which may be
different from, and lower than, the closing price of ScanSoft common stock on
the last full trading day preceding the public announcement that ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks entered into the merger agreement, the last full trading day prior
to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the special
meetings. Moreover, completion of the merger may occur some time after the
requisite stockholder approvals have been obtained. There will be no adjustment
to the exchange ratio (except for adjustments to reflect the effect of any stock
split or other recapitalization of ScanSoft common stock or SpeechWorks common
stock), and the parties do not have a right to terminate the merger agreement,
based upon changes in the market price of either ScanSoft common stock or
SpeechWorks common stock.

  SCANSOFT MAY FAIL TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY SCANSOFT'S AND SPEECHWORKS'
  OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE
  ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF
  SCANSOFT COMMON STOCK.

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks entered into the merger agreement with the
expectation that the merger will result in benefits to ScanSoft and SpeechWorks,
including establishing a greater global presence, stronger channel and partner
capabilities, and ScanSoft's ability to sell complementary products and
technologies to a wider range of customers. However, these expected benefits may
not be fully realized. Failure of the combined company to meet the challenges
involved with successfully integrating the personnel, products, technology and
sales operations of the two companies following the merger or to realize any of
the other anticipated benefits of the merger, could have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of
ScanSoft and its subsidiaries, including SpeechWorks. These integration efforts
may be difficult and time consuming, especially considering the highly technical
and complex nature of each company's products. The challenges involved in this
integration include the following:

     - coordinating software development operations in a rapid and efficient
       manner to ensure timely release of products to market;

     - combining product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;

     - successfully managing difficulties associated with transitioning current
       customers to new product lines;

     - demonstrating to our existing and potential customers that the merger
       will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or
       business focus;

     - retaining key alliances with partners and suppliers;

     - coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate effectively the
       capabilities of the combined company;

     - absorbing costs and delays in implementing overlapping systems and
       procedures, including financial accounting systems;

     - persuading employees that ScanSoft's and SpeechWorks' business cultures
       are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;
       and

     - overcoming potential distraction of management attention and resources
       from the business of the combined company.

     The combined company may not successfully integrate the operations and
technology of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks in a timely manner, or at all, and the
combined company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger to the
extent, or in the timeframe, anticipated, which could significantly harm its
business.

  SCANSOFT'S OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF
  PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACT OF AMORTIZATION OF
  OTHER INTANGIBLES RELATING TO ITS PROPOSED MERGER WITH SPEECHWORKS, IF THE
  RESULTS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY DO NOT OFFSET THESE ADDITIONAL EXPENSES.

     Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, ScanSoft will account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting. Under purchase accounting, ScanSoft will record the market value of
its common stock issued in connection with the merger and the amount of direct
transaction costs as the cost of acquiring the business of SpeechWorks. ScanSoft
will allocate that cost to the individual assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired
technology, acquired trade names, and acquired customer relationships and
assumed above-market lease liabilities based on their respective fair values.
Intangible assets generally will be amortized over a four to ten year period.
The amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill will be approximately $112.8
million and the amount allocated to identifiable intangible assets will be

approximately $13.9 million. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is
subject to at least an annual impairment analysis, which may result in an
impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. If other
identifiable intangible assets were amortized in equal quarterly amounts over a
six-year period following completion of the merger, the accounting charge
attributable to these items would be approximately $0.6 million per quarter and
$2.3 million per fiscal year. As a result, purchase accounting treatment of the
merger could decrease net income for ScanSoft in the foreseeable future, which
could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of ScanSoft common
stock following completion of the merger.

  SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
  MERGER.

     ScanSoft estimates that it will incur direct transaction costs of
approximately $4.5 million associated with the merger, which will be included as
a part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes. In addition,
SpeechWorks estimates that it will incur direct transaction costs for
accounting, investment banking and legal services of approximately $3.4 million,
which are expensed in the quarter in which they are incurred. A portion of the
SpeechWorks costs will be determined upon the closing. ScanSoft and SpeechWorks
believe the combined entity may incur charges to operations, which currently are
not reasonably estimable, in the quarter in which the merger is completed or the
following quarters, to reflect costs associated with integrating the two
companies. There can be no assurance that the combined company will not incur
additional material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs
associated with the merger.

  SPEECHWORKS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
  FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, INTERESTS OF SPEECHWORKS STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY,
  WHICH MAY INFLUENCE THEM TO SUPPORT THE MERGER.

     When considering the recommendation of the SpeechWorks board of directors
regarding the merger, you should be aware of the interests that executive
officers and directors of SpeechWorks have in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, interests of SpeechWorks stockholders generally. These
interests include, among others:

     - existing agreements and new employment agreements with ScanSoft that
       provide, among other things, for severance and other benefits as a result
       of the merger;

     - continued director and officer indemnification and insurance; and

     - acceleration of all SpeechWorks options held by officers and directors
       and the partial acceleration of shares of SpeechWorks restricted stock
       held by officers.

     As a result, these directors and officers may be more likely to vote to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger than if they did not have
these other interests. As of the record date, SpeechWorks executive officers and
their directors and certain of their affiliates, who together beneficially owned
approximately [          ] shares of SpeechWorks common stock (excluding options
to purchase shares of SpeechWorks common stock), which represented [  ]% of the
outstanding shares of SpeechWorks common stock entitled to vote at the
SpeechWorks special meeting, have agreed to vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the merger.

  WHETHER OR NOT THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND PENDENCY OF THE
  PROPOSED MERGER HAS CAUSED DISRUPTIONS IN THE BUSINESS OF SPEECHWORKS AND MAY
  CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THE BUSINESS OF SPEECHWORKS OR DISRUPTIONS IN THE
  BUSINESS OF SCANSOFT, WHICH COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EACH
  COMPANY'S OR THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     Whether or not the merger is completed, ScanSoft's and SpeechWorks'
customers, in response to the announcement and pendency of the merger, may delay
or defer purchase decisions, which could have a material adverse effect on the
business of each company or the combined company. In addition, current and
prospective ScanSoft and SpeechWorks employees may experience uncertainty about
their future roles with the combined company. This uncertainty may adversely
affect ScanSoft's and SpeechWorks' ability to

attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. The
extent of this adverse effect could depend on the length of time prior to
completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT SPEECHWORKS' STOCK
  PRICE, FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, SpeechWorks may be subject
to a number of material risks, including the following:

     - SpeechWorks would not realize any anticipated benefits from being a part
       of a combined company with ScanSoft;

     - SpeechWorks may be obligated to pay ScanSoft a fee of $6.5 million in
       liquidated damages if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
       circumstances in connection with an alternative transaction proposal;

     - the price of SpeechWorks common stock may decline to the extent that its
       current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be
       completed;

     - SpeechWorks may experience difficulties in attracting strategic customers
       and partners who were expecting to use the products proposed to be
       offered by the combined company;

     - SpeechWorks must pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal,
       accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, even if the merger is
       not completed, which costs will be substantial; and

     - SpeechWorks may not be able to find another buyer willing to pay an
       equivalent or higher price in an alternative transaction than the price
       that would be paid pursuant to the merger.

  REGULATORY AGENCIES, PRIVATE PARTIES, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND OTHER
  ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES MAY RAISE CHALLENGES TO THE MERGER ON ANTITRUST GROUNDS.

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
the merger may not be consummated unless certain filings have been submitted to
the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Antitrust Division and certain
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. ScanSoft and SpeechWorks filed
the appropriate notification and report forms with the FTC and with the
Antitrust Division and notice of the early termination of the waiting period was
received on June 5, 2003.

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions like the merger. At any time before or after
the completion of the merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take any
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
the divestiture of substantial assets of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks. In addition,
certain private parties, as well as state attorneys general and other antitrust
authorities, may challenge the transaction under antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.

     In addition, the merger may be subject to various foreign antitrust laws.

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks believe that the completion of the merger will not
violate any antitrust laws. There can be no assurance, however, that a challenge
to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is
made, what the result will be.

  THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON STOCK IN
  CONNECTION WITH THE ACCELERATION OF OPTIONS AND SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON
  STOCK MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

     In order to eliminate the ongoing compensation expense and limit the number
of outstanding options that would result from SpeechWorks options remaining
outstanding as ScanSoft options after the merger,

ScanSoft has required that all SpeechWorks options be accelerated and, to the
extent not exercised, terminated prior to the closing of the merger. The vesting
of options held by non-officer employees will accelerate as of the second
business day following the filing date of the registration statement of which
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. The vesting of all options and
50% of the shares of restricted stock held by officers and directors will
accelerate prior to the closing of the merger on a date to be determined by the
SpeechWorks board of directors. SpeechWorks cannot determine the number of
options that SpeechWorks employees, officers and directors will exercise and,
with respect to the shares of SpeechWorks common stock issued upon exercise,
sell prior to the effective time of the merger. SpeechWorks expects, however,
that all optionholders will exercise their in-the-money options prior to the
closing of the merger and that many optionholders, including SpeechWorks
executive officers and directors, will elect to sell at least the portion of the
shares issued upon exercise as is necessary to recoup the exercise price and pay
any tax liabilities which the optionholder incurs in connection with the option
exercise. In addition, executive officers and directors and other employees may
for personal reasons, including to diversify their investment holdings, elect to
sell some or all of the remaining shares acquired upon exercise of options prior
to the closing of the merger. As of May 28, 2003, officers and directors of
SpeechWorks owned options to purchase an aggregate of 1,637,131 shares of
SpeechWorks common stock, of which 513,032 were then unvested, and all other
employees held options to purchase an aggregate of 3,451,222 shares of
SpeechWorks common stock, of which 1,811,155 were then unvested, with an
exercise price less than $4.95. The market price of SpeechWorks common stock
could decline as a result of the sale of some or all of these shares or the
perception that substantial sales could occur. See the section entitled "The
Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger -- Interests of SpeechWorks
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

  THE PRICE OF SCANSOFT COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM
  THOSE AFFECTING THE PRICE OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON STOCK.

     When the merger is completed, holders of SpeechWorks common stock will
become holders of ScanSoft common stock. ScanSoft's business differs from that
of SpeechWorks, and ScanSoft's results of operations, as well as the price of
ScanSoft common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting
SpeechWorks' results of operations and the price of SpeechWorks common stock.

RISKS RELATED TO SCANSOFT AND THE COMBINED COMPANY

  SCANSOFT'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS AND
  SEASONALITY. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR
  INVESTORS, SCANSOFT'S SHARE PRICE MAY DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

     ScanSoft's revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and
may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future.
If this occurs, the price of ScanSoft common stock would likely decline. Factors
that may cause fluctuations in ScanSoft's operating results include the
following:

     - slowing sales by ScanSoft's distribution and fulfillment partners to
       their customers, which may place pressure on these partners to reduce
       purchases of ScanSoft's products;

     - volume, timing and fulfillment of customer orders;

     - customers delaying their purchase decisions in anticipation of new
       versions of products;

     - customers delaying, canceling or limiting their purchases as result of
       the threat or results of terrorism or military actions taken by the
       United States or its allies;

     - introduction of new products by ScanSoft or ScanSoft's competitors;

     - seasonality;

     - reduction in the prices of ScanSoft's products in response to competition
       or market conditions;

     - returns and allowance charges in excess of recorded amounts;

     - timing of significant marketing and sales promotions;

     - increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market
       opportunities;

     - inability to adjust ScanSoft's operating expenses to compensate for
       shortfalls in revenue against forecast;

     - demand for products; and

     - general economic trends as they affect retail and corporate sales.

     Due to the foregoing factors, among others, ScanSoft's revenue and
operating results are difficult to forecast. ScanSoft's expense levels are based
in significant part on ScanSoft's expectations of future revenue. Therefore,
ScanSoft's failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm ScanSoft's
business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, an
unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately
affect ScanSoft's profitability because a relatively small amount of ScanSoft's
expenses are intended to vary with ScanSoft's revenue in the short term.

  SCANSOFT HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES. SCANSOFT MAY INCUR LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

     ScanSoft sustained recurring losses from operations in each reporting
period through December 31, 2001. ScanSoft reported net income of $0.1 million
and $6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2002, respectively. If ScanSoft cannot maintain
profitability, the market price for ScanSoft's stock may decline, perhaps
substantially.

  SCANSOFT'S BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED IF SCANSOFT DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE
  THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES THAT SCANSOFT ACQUIRES, INCLUDING SCANSOFT'S
  PLANNED MERGER WITH SPEECHWORKS AND THE RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF THE
  SPEECH PROCESSING TELEPHONY AND VOICE CONTROL BUSINESS UNITS OF PHILIPS.

     As part of ScanSoft's business strategy, ScanSoft has in the past acquired,
and expects to continue to acquire, other businesses and technologies.
ScanSoft's recent acquisitions of the speech and language technology operations
of Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V. and certain of its affiliates,
including L&H Holdings USA, Inc. (collectively, L&H), and the Telephony and
Voice Control business units of Philips Speech Processing required substantial
integration and management efforts. ScanSoft's pending acquisition of
SpeechWorks will pose similar, and potentially greater, challenges. Acquisitions
of this nature involve a number of risks, including:

     - difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel
       of the acquired businesses;

     - potential disruption of ScanSoft's ongoing business and distraction of
       management;

     - difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into
       ScanSoft's products and technology;

     - unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development
       projects and technology integration;

     - management of geographically remote units both in the United States and
       internationally;

     - impairment of relationships with partners and customers;

     - entering markets or types of businesses in which ScanSoft has limited
       experience; and

     - potential loss of key employees of the acquired company.

     As a result of these and other risks, ScanSoft may not realize anticipated
benefits from ScanSoft's acquisitions. Any failure to achieve these benefits or
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies could
seriously harm ScanSoft's business. The size of the SpeechWorks merger
significantly increases both the scope and consequences of ScanSoft's
integration risks.

  THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE MANAGED BY A MANAGEMENT TEAM CONSISTING OF
  CURRENT SCANSOFT AND SPEECHWORKS EXECUTIVES, AND THIS MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY
  UNDERTAKE A STRATEGY AND BUSINESS DIRECTION WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH
  WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY SCANSOFT'S CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAM.

     After the merger, the new management team of the combined company will
consist of certain current ScanSoft and SpeechWorks executives. The manner in
which the new management team conducts the business of the combined company, and
the direction in which the new management team moves the business, may differ
from the manner and direction in which the current management of either ScanSoft
or SpeechWorks would direct the combined or separate companies on a stand-alone
basis. Such control by the new management team, together with the effects of
future market factors and conditions, could ultimately evolve into an
integration and business strategy that, when implemented, differs from the
strategy and business direction currently recommended by ScanSoft's or
SpeechWorks' current respective management and board of directors. The new
management team, and any change in business or direction, may not improve, and
could adversely impact, the combined company's financial condition and results
of operations.

  A LARGE PART OF SCANSOFT'S REVENUE IS DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR
  SCANSOFT'S PRODUCTS FROM ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, OR OEM, PARTNERS. A
  SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OEM REVENUE WOULD SERIOUSLY HARM SCANSOFT'S BUSINESS,
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STOCK PRICE.

     Many of ScanSoft's technologies are licensed to partners that incorporate
ScanSoft's technologies into solutions that they sell to their customers. The
commercial success of these licensed products depends to a substantial degree on
the efforts of these licensees in developing and marketing products
incorporating ScanSoft's technologies. The integration of ScanSoft's
technologies into their products takes significant time, effort and investment,
and products incorporating ScanSoft's technologies may not be successfully
implemented or marketed by ScanSoft's licensees.

     OEM revenue represented 36% and 38% of ScanSoft's consolidated revenue for
the three-month periods ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A select
few of ScanSoft's OEM partners account for a majority of ScanSoft's OEM
revenues. ScanSoft's partners are not required to continue to bundle or embed
ScanSoft's software, and they may choose the software products of ScanSoft's
competitors in addition to, or in place of, ScanSoft's products. A significant
reduction in OEM revenue would seriously harm ScanSoft's business, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price.

  SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT ACHIEVE WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE BY BUSINESSES, WHICH
  COULD LIMIT SCANSOFT'S ABILITY TO GROW ITS SPEECH BUSINESS.

     The market for speech technologies is relatively new and rapidly evolving.
ScanSoft's ability to increase revenue in the future depends in large measure on
acceptance by both its customers and the end users of speech technologies in
general and ScanSoft's products in particular. The continued development of the
market for ScanSoft's current and future speech solutions will also depend on
the following factors:

     - widespread deployment and acceptance of speech technologies;

     - consumer demand for speech-enabled applications;

     - development by third-party vendors of applications using speech
       technologies; and

     - continuous improvement in speech technology.

     Sales of ScanSoft's speech products would be harmed if the market for
speech software does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than
ScanSoft expects.

  SCANSOFT HAS GROWN AND MAY CONTINUE TO GROW, THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, WHICH MAY
  RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DILUTION OF SCANSOFT'S EXISTING
  STOCKHOLDERS, USE OF CASH AND OTHER RISKS.

     ScanSoft has made several significant acquisitions over the last two years,
has recently completed the purchase of certain businesses and intellectual
property from Philips and has announced the pending

acquisition of SpeechWorks and may acquire additional complementary assets,
technologies or businesses in the future. ScanSoft's past acquisitions have
given rise to, and future acquisitions may result in, substantial levels of
intangible assets that will be amortized or subject to impairment analyses in
future periods, and ScanSoft's future results will be adversely affected if
ScanSoft does not realize benefits from these acquisitions commensurate with
amortization and potential impairment charges. In addition, ScanSoft's
acquisition of Caere Corporation included a substantial write-off of acquired
in-process research and development costs, and similar write-offs may also occur
as a result of other acquisitions.

     In connection with the Caere and L&H acquisitions, ScanSoft issued 19.0
million and 7.4 million shares of ScanSoft common stock, respectively, and in
connection with the proposed SpeechWorks acquisition, ScanSoft expects to issue
approximately 32.6 million shares of ScanSoft common stock, subject to
adjustment based on the number of shares of SpeechWorks common stock outstanding
at the closing of the merger. ScanSoft may continue to issue equity securities
for future acquisitions and working capital purposes that could dilute
ScanSoft's existing stockholders. In connection with the L&H acquisition,
ScanSoft issued a promissory note for $3.5 million. Under the terms of the
Philips acquisition, ScanSoft paid 3.1 million euros ($3.4 million) in cash at
closing, subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the purchase
agreement, as amended, and agreed to a deferred payment of 1.0 million euros in
cash prior to December 31, 2003, issued a 5.0 million euro note due December 31,
2003 and bearing 5.0% interest per annum and issued a $27.5 million three-year,
zero-interest subordinated debenture, convertible at any time at Philips' option
into shares of ScanSoft common stock at $6.00 per share. Future acquisitions may
also require ScanSoft to expend significant funds or incur debt. If ScanSoft
expends funds or incurs additional debt, ScanSoft's ability to obtain financing
for working capital or other purposes could decrease.

  SALES OF SCANSOFT'S DOCUMENT AND PDF CONVERSION PRODUCTS AND SCANSOFT'S
  DIGITAL PAPER MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 43% OF SCANSOFT'S
  REVENUE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2003 AND APPROXIMATELY 51%
  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2002. ANY REDUCTION IN REVENUE FROM
  THESE PRODUCT AREAS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM SCANSOFT'S BUSINESS.

     Historically, a few product areas have generated a substantial portion of
ScanSoft's revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2003, ScanSoft's
document and PDF conversion products represented approximately 26% of ScanSoft's
revenue and ScanSoft's digital paper management products represented
approximately 17% of its revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2002,
ScanSoft's document and PDF conversion products represented approximately 36% of
its revenue, and ScanSoft's digital paper management products represented
approximately 15% of its revenue. Although the relative share of ScanSoft's
revenue derived from these products decreased due to the inclusion of sales of
its speech products after the L&H acquisition, a reduction in the revenue
contribution from these product areas could seriously harm ScanSoft's business,
results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.

  THE PROTECTION OF SCANSOFT'S PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  IS KEY TO SCANSOFT'S SUCCESS.

     ScanSoft relies heavily on its proprietary technology, trade secrets and
other intellectual property. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of
ScanSoft's products or to obtain and use information that ScanSoft regards as
proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of ScanSoft's products is difficult and
ScanSoft may not be able to protect ScanSoft's technology from unauthorized use.
Additionally, ScanSoft's competitors may independently develop technologies that
are substantially the same as or superior to ScanSoft's technologies. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ScanSoft's
proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Although
the source code for ScanSoft's proprietary software is protected both as a trade
secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation may be necessary to enforce
ScanSoft's intellectual property rights, to protect ScanSoft's trade secrets, to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to
defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of
the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert management efforts.

  THIRD PARTIES HAVE CLAIMED AND MAY CLAIM IN THE FUTURE THAT SCANSOFT IS
  INFRINGING THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SCANSOFT COULD BE EXPOSED TO
  SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING
  SCANSOFT'S PRODUCTS IF SUCH CLAIMS ARE SUCCESSFUL.

     Like other technology companies, from time to time, ScanSoft is subject to
claims that ScanSoft or its customers may be infringing or contributing to the
infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. ScanSoft may be
unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
ScanSoft's technologies and products. If it appears necessary or desirable,
ScanSoft may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However,
ScanSoft may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants, the
terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to ScanSoft, or ScanSoft may
not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation regarding
intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the
attention of ScanSoft's management and key personnel from ScanSoft's business
operations. In the event of a claim of intellectual property infringement,
ScanSoft may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.
Third parties claiming intellectual property infringement may be able to obtain
injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block ScanSoft's
ability to develop and sell ScanSoft's products.

     On November 27, 2002, AllVoice Computing plc filed an action against
ScanSoft in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas
claiming patent infringement. Damages are sought in an unspecified amount.
ScanSoft filed an Answer on December 23, 2002. ScanSoft believes this claim has
no merit, and ScanSoft intends to defend the action vigorously.

     On December 28, 2001, ScanSoft was sued for patent infringement initiated
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Electronics For Imaging, Inc.
ScanSoft was one of more than 200 defendants named in this lawsuit. Damages are
sought in an unspecified amount. ScanSoft filed an Answer and Counterclaim on
June 28, 2002. ScanSoft believes this claim has no merit, and ScanSoft intends
to defend the action vigorously.

     On August 16, 2001, ScanSoft was sued by Horst Froessl for patent
infringement. Damages are sought in an unspecified amount. ScanSoft filed an
Answer and Counterclaim on September 19, 2001. ScanSoft believes this claim has
no merit, and ScanSoft intends to defend the action vigorously.

     ScanSoft believes that the final outcome of the current litigation matters
described above will not have a significant adverse effect on its financial
position and results of operations, and ScanSoft believes that ScanSoft will not
be required to expend a significant amount of resources defending such claims.
However, should ScanSoft not prevail in these litigation matters or if ScanSoft
is required to expend a significant amount of resources defending such claims,
ScanSoft's operating results, financial position and cash flows could be
adversely impacted. If any third parties are successful in intellectual property
infringement claims against ScanSoft, ScanSoft may be subject to significant
damages or injunctions, and ScanSoft's operating results and financial position
could be harmed.

  THE MARKETS IN WHICH SCANSOFT OPERATES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY
  CHANGING. SCANSOFT MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST NEW ENTRANTS
  AND ESTABLISHED COMPANIES WITH GREATER RESOURCES.

     There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that
compete in ScanSoft's targeted markets; however, there is no one company that
competes with ScanSoft in all of its product areas. The individual markets in
which ScanSoft competes are highly competitive, and are rapidly changing. Within
digital capture, ScanSoft competes directly with ABBYY, I.R.I.S. and NewSoft.
Within speech, ScanSoft competes with AT&T, IBM, Loquendo, Microsoft, Nuance
Communications, Rhetorical and Temic Speech Processing, among others. Vendors
such as Adobe and Microsoft offer solutions that can be considered alternatives
to some of ScanSoft's solutions. In addition, a number of smaller companies
produce technologies or products that are in some markets competitive with
ScanSoft's solutions. Current and potential competitors have established, or may
establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to
increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of ScanSoft's
prospective customers.

     The competition in these markets could adversely affect ScanSoft's
operating results by reducing the volume of the products ScanSoft sells or the
prices ScanSoft can charge. Some of ScanSoft's current or potential competitors
have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than
ScanSoft does. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than
ScanSoft can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer
requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their products than ScanSoft does. The price and
performance of ScanSoft's products and technologies may not be superior relative
to the products of ScanSoft's competitors. As a result, ScanSoft may lose
competitive position, which loss could result in lower prices, fewer customer
orders, reduced revenue, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.
ScanSoft's products and technologies may not achieve market acceptance or sell
at favorable prices, which could hurt ScanSoft's revenue, results of operations
and the price of ScanSoft common stock.

     Some of ScanSoft's customers, such as Microsoft, have developed or acquired
products or technologies that compete with ScanSoft's products and technologies.
These customers may give higher priority to the sale of these competitive
products or technologies. To the extent they do so, market acceptance and
penetration of ScanSoft's products, and therefore ScanSoft's revenue, may be
adversely affected.

     ScanSoft's success will depend substantially upon its ability to enhance
its products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and
cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer
requirements and incorporate technological advancements. If ScanSoft is unable
to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to
these changes, or is unable to realize synergies among its acquired products and
technologies, ScanSoft's business will suffer.

  SCANSOFT'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY HAVE BUGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DELAYED OR
  LOST REVENUE, EXPENSIVE CORRECTION, LIABILITY TO ITS CLIENTS AND CLAIMS
  AGAINST SCANSOFT.

     Complex software products such as ScanSoft's may contain errors, defects or
other software bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that ScanSoft develops
and sells to its customers could require expensive corrections and result in
delayed or lost revenue, adverse client reaction and negative publicity about
ScanSoft or its products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any
of ScanSoft's products could bring claims against ScanSoft for damages, which,
even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result
in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm ScanSoft's
financial results and competitive position.

  SCANSOFT RELIES ON A SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT PARTNERS,
  INCLUDING 1450, DIGITAL RIVER, INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, TO DISTRIBUTE MANY
  OF ITS PRODUCTS. ANY DISRUPTION IN THESE CHANNELS COULD HARM SCANSOFT'S
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     ScanSoft's products are sold through, and a substantial portion of its
revenue is derived from, a network of over 2000 channel partners, including
value-added resellers, computer superstores, consumer electronic stores, mail
order houses, office superstores and eCommerce Web sites. ScanSoft relies on a
small number of distribution and fulfillment partners, including 1450, Digital
River, Ingram Micro and Tech Data to serve this network of channel partners. For
the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, two distribution and fulfillment
partners, Ingram Micro and Digital River, accounted for 25% and 17% of
ScanSoft's consolidated revenue, respectively. During the three-month period
ended March 31, 2002, Ingram Micro and Digital River accounted for 27% and 11%
of ScanSoft's consolidated revenue, respectively. A disruption in these
distribution and fulfillment partner relationships could negatively affect
ScanSoft's results of operations in the short term. Any disruption for which
ScanSoft is unable to compensate could have a more sustained impact on
ScanSoft's results of operations.

  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SCANSOFT'S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS CONCENTRATED AMONG
  SCANSOFT'S THREE LARGEST DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT PARTNERS, INGRAM MICRO,
  INC., TECH DATA CORPORATION, AND DIGITAL RIVER, INC.

     ScanSoft's products are sold through, and a substantial portion of its
accounts receivable is derived from, three distribution and fulfillment
partners. At March 31, 2003, Ingram Micro, Tech Data and Digital River
represented 16%, 3% and 15% of ScanSoft's net accounts receivable, respectively.
At March 31, 2002, Ingram Micro, Tech Data and Digital River represented 16%,
11% and 9%, of ScanSoft's net accounts receivable, respectively. In addition,
although ScanSoft performs ongoing credit evaluations of its distribution and
fulfillment partners' financial condition and maintain reserves for potential
credit losses, ScanSoft does not require collateral. While, to date, such losses
have been within ScanSoft's expectations, ScanSoft cannot assure you that these
actions will be sufficient to meet future contingencies. If any of these
distribution and fulfillment partners were unable to pay ScanSoft in a timely
fashion or if ScanSoft were to experience significant credit losses in excess of
its reserves, ScanSoft's results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition would be seriously harmed.

  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SCANSOFT'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM SALES IN EUROPE
  AND ASIA. SCANSOFT'S RESULTS COULD BE HARMED BY ECONOMIC, POLITICAL,
  REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL
  REGIONS.

     Since ScanSoft sells its products worldwide, ScanSoft's business is subject
to risks associated with doing business internationally. ScanSoft anticipates
that revenue from international operations will represent an increasing portion
of its total revenue. Reported international revenue for the three-month periods
ended March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002, represented 26% and 22% of ScanSoft's
consolidated revenue for those periods, respectively. Most of these
international revenues are produced by sales in Europe and Asia. A number of
ScanSoft's OEM partners distribute their products throughout the world and do
not provide ScanSoft with the geographical dispersion of their products.
However, based on an estimate that factors ScanSoft's OEM partners' geographical
revenue mix into ScanSoft's revenue generated from these OEM partners,
international revenue would have represented approximately 33% and 30% of
ScanSoft's consolidated revenue for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2003
and March 31, 2002, respectively.

     Therefore, in addition to risks to ScanSoft's business based on a potential
downturn in the world economy, a region-specific downturn affecting countries in
Western Europe and/or Asia could have a negative effect on ScanSoft's future
results of operations.

     In addition, some of ScanSoft's products are developed and manufactured
outside the United States. A significant portion of the development and
manufacturing of ScanSoft's speech products are completed in Belgium, and a
significant portion of ScanSoft's digital capture research and development is
conducted in Hungary. In addition, in connection with the Philips acquisition,
ScanSoft has added an additional research and development location in Germany.
ScanSoft's future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated
with international sales and operations in addition to the risks the company as
a whole faces, including:

     - changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic
       conditions;

     - trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements
       imposed by the United States or by other countries;

     - negative consequences from changes in applicable tax laws;

     - difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in
       many countries;

     - difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries;
       and

     - less effective protection of intellectual property.

  SCANSOFT IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

     Because ScanSoft has international subsidiaries and distributors that
operate and sell its products outside the United States, ScanSoft is exposed to
the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic
conditions in these countries. ScanSoft generally does not engage in hedging
transactions to manage its exposure to currency fluctuations. However, in
connection with the Philips acquisition, on January 30, 2003, ScanSoft entered
into a forward hedge in the amount of $5.3 million to meet ScanSoft's obligation
to pay a 5.0 million euro promissory note issued to Philips as part of the
acquisition. ScanSoft's exposure to currency rate fluctuations could affect its
results of operations and cash flows.

  IF SCANSOFT IS UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL
  PERSONNEL, SCANSOFT'S BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED.

     If any of ScanSoft's key employees were to leave ScanSoft, ScanSoft could
face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience
a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and
experience. ScanSoft's employment relationships are generally at-will and
ScanSoft has had key employees leave ScanSoft in the past. ScanSoft cannot
assure you that one or more key employees will not leave ScanSoft in the future.
ScanSoft intends to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel,
including software engineers and operational personnel, but ScanSoft may not be
able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any
failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm
ScanSoft's business.

  THE STOCKHOLDINGS OF SCANSOFT'S TWO LARGEST STOCKHOLDERS MAY ENABLE THEM TO
  INFLUENCE MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.

     As of May 30, 2003, Xerox beneficially owned approximately 22.7% of
ScanSoft's outstanding common stock, including warrants exercisable for up to
525,732 shares of ScanSoft common stock and 3,562,238 shares of ScanSoft's
outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, each of which is convertible into one
share of ScanSoft common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise of the Xerox warrants may increase in accordance with a formula
defined in the warrant agreement. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, or
SWIB, is ScanSoft's second largest stockholder, owning approximately 17.7% of
ScanSoft's common stock as of May 30, 2003. Because of their large holdings of
ScanSoft's capital stock relative to other stockholders, Xerox and SWIB, acting
individually or together, could have a strong influence over matters requiring
approval by ScanSoft stockholders.

  THE MARKET PRICE OF SCANSOFT'S COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE
  SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS.

     ScanSoft's stock price historically has been and may continue to be
volatile. Various factors contribute to the volatility of ScanSoft's stock
price, including, for example, quarterly variations in ScanSoft's financial
results, new product introductions by ScanSoft or ScanSoft's competitors and
general economic and market conditions. While ScanSoft cannot predict the
individual effect that these factors may have on the market price of ScanSoft's
common stock, these factors, either individually or in the aggregate, could
result in significant volatility in ScanSoft's stock price during any given
period of time. Moreover, companies that have experienced volatility in the
market price of their stock often are subject to securities class action
litigation. If ScanSoft was the subject of such litigation, it could result in
substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.

  SCANSOFT HAS IMPLEMENTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS, WHICH COULD DISCOURAGE OR
  PREVENT A TAKEOVER, EVEN IF AN ACQUISITION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SCANSOFT
  STOCKHOLDERS.

     Provisions of ScanSoft's amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire ScanSoft, even if doing so would be beneficial to ScanSoft stockholders.
These provisions include:

     - a preferred shares rights agreement;

     - authorized "blank check" preferred stock;

     - a prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors;

     - a limitation on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of
       stockholders;

     - a requirement that all stockholder actions be taken at meetings of
       ScanSoft stockholders; and

     - a requirement for advance notice for nominations of directors and for
       stockholder proposals.

RISKS RELATED TO SPEECHWORKS

  SPEECHWORKS HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND SPEECHWORKS EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO
  INCUR NET LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WHICH LOSSES MAY DEPRESS
  SPEECHWORKS' COMMON STOCK PRICE.

     SpeechWorks had an accumulated deficit of $174.1 million at March 31, 2003,
and SpeechWorks expects to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Net
losses were $9.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, $51.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2002, $46.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
SpeechWorks anticipates continuing to incur significant sales and marketing,
research and development and general and administrative expenses and, as a
result, SpeechWorks will need to generate higher revenues to achieve and sustain
profitability. SpeechWorks cannot be certain that it will realize sufficient
revenues to achieve profitability. Moreover, if SpeechWorks were to achieve
profitability, SpeechWorks may not be able to sustain or increase its
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Any additional financing that
SpeechWorks may require in the future may not be available at all or, if
available, may be on terms unfavorable to SpeechWorks. Failure to achieve or
maintain profitability may depress the market price of SpeechWorks' common
stock.

  SPEECHWORKS EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE.
  IF SPEECHWORKS' QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS FAIL TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF
  FINANCIAL ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, THE TRADING PRICE OF SPEECHWORKS' COMMON
  STOCK MAY DECLINE.

     SpeechWorks' revenues and operating results can vary significantly from
quarter to quarter. A number of important factors are likely to cause these
variations, including:

     - the timing of sales of SpeechWorks' products and services, particularly
       in light of SpeechWorks' dependence on a relatively small number of large
       orders, including international orders,

     - the mix of domestic and international sales,

     - the timing of product implementations, particularly large client design
       projects,

     - unexpected delays in introducing new products and services,

     - variation in capital spending budgets of SpeechWorks' clients and
       potential clients,

     - variation in SpeechWorks' expenses, whether related to sales and
       marketing, product development or administration,

     - deferral of recognition of SpeechWorks' revenue in accordance with
       applicable accounting principles due to the time required to complete
       projects,

     - the mix of product license and services revenue, and

     - costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses or
       strategic business combinations involving the company.

     Because of the volatility of SpeechWorks' quarterly results and the
difficulty in predicting SpeechWorks' future performance, SpeechWorks' operating
results may fall below the expectations of analysts or investors and, as a
result, the price of SpeechWorks' common stock may decline.

  IF THE ESTIMATES SPEECHWORKS MAKES, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH SPEECHWORKS
  RELIES, IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVE INACCURATE, SPEECHWORKS'
  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM THOSE REFLECTED IN SPEECHWORKS' PROJECTIONS AND
  ACCRUALS.

     SpeechWorks' financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
preparation of these financial statements requires SpeechWorks to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of SpeechWorks' assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by
SpeechWorks, such as those made in connection with SpeechWorks' restructurings,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. SpeechWorks bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
SpeechWorks believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no
assurance, however, that SpeechWorks' estimates, or the assumptions underlying
them, will be correct.

  THE SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY HAS AFFECTED THE MARKET FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
  PRODUCTS, AND SPEECHWORKS' FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON
  WHETHER THIS SLOWDOWN CONTINUES.

     As a result of prolonged unfavorable economic conditions and reduced
capital spending by SpeechWorks' customers and potential customers, demand for
SpeechWorks' products and services has been adversely affected. This has
resulted in decreased revenues. Many of SpeechWorks' customers are in the
telecommunications and airline industries, which have been severely affected by
the current economic downturn. If the current economic conditions continue or
worsen, SpeechWorks may experience a material adverse impact on its business,
operating results and financial condition.

  SOME OF SPEECHWORKS' CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS ARE NEWLY FORMED BUSINESSES OR
  BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT YET PROFITABLE. IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL OR EXPERIENCE
  FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, SPEECHWORKS' BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

     Some of SpeechWorks' customers and partners are financed by investments
from venture capital investors. Given the current general economic conditions
and investment climate, these companies could face difficulties in securing
additional financing to fund their operations. If these companies are not yet
profitable or self-sustaining based on their operations, they could be unable to
satisfy their commitments to SpeechWorks. Even if they are able to meet current
obligations to SpeechWorks, they may not be able to buy additional products and
services from SpeechWorks. If these companies cannot meet their current
obligations to SpeechWorks or fail, SpeechWorks' business could be significantly
harmed and its revenue could decline.

  SPEECH-ACTIVATED SYSTEMS ARE RELATIVELY NEW PRODUCTS, AND SPEECHWORKS' SUCCESS
  WILL DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS ON THE
  COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS. IF SPEECHWORKS' POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND
  THEIR CUSTOMERS DO NOT ACCEPT SPEECH-ACTIVATED SYSTEMS, SPEECHWORKS' BUSINESS
  WILL BE HARMED.

     SpeechWorks' business would be harmed if use of speech-activated,
e-business solutions does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than
SpeechWorks expects. SpeechWorks' market is relatively new and rapidly evolving.
SpeechWorks' future success depends on the acceptance by current and future
clients and their customers of speech-activated services as an integral part of
their businesses. The size of SpeechWorks' market will depend in part on
consumer acceptance of automated speech systems and the actual and perceived
quality of these systems. The adoption of speech-activated services could be
hindered by the perceived costs of this new technology, as well as the
reluctance of enterprises

that have invested substantial resources in existing call centers,
touch-tone-based systems or internet-based infrastructures to replace or enhance
their current systems with this new technology. Accordingly, in order to achieve
commercial acceptance, SpeechWorks will have to educate prospective clients,
including large, established telecommunications companies, about the uses and
benefits of speech-activated services in general and SpeechWorks' products in
particular. If these efforts fail, or if speech-activated software platforms do
not achieve broad commercial acceptance, SpeechWorks' business could be
significantly harmed and its revenues could decline. In addition, the continued
development of new and evolving wireless technologies using a visual web browser
interface could adversely affect the demand for speech-activated services.

  SPEECHWORKS CURRENTLY RELIES ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF LARGE ORDERS FOR A
  SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES. AS A RESULT, SPEECHWORKS' INABILITY TO
  SECURE ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT CLIENTS DURING A GIVEN PERIOD OR THE LOSS OF ONE
  MAJOR CLIENT COULD CAUSE SPEECHWORKS' QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO
  SUFFER. SPEECHWORKS' STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNEXPECTED
  QUARTERLY REVENUE DECLINES CAUSED BY DELAYS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION.

     Due to the nature of SpeechWorks' business, in any quarter SpeechWorks is
dependent upon a limited number of orders that are relatively large in relation
to its overall revenues. There was no single customer that represented more than
10% of SpeechWorks' total revenues during the three-month period ended March 31,
2003 or for the year ended December 31, 2002. However, one of SpeechWorks'
resellers accounted for 19.3% of SpeechWorks' total revenue in 2001 and 16.1% of
SpeechWorks' total revenue in 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2002, there
was a decline in demand from this reseller to less than 10% of SpeechWorks'
total revenues. SpeechWorks' speech-activated products and services require
significant expenditures by SpeechWorks' clients and typically involve lengthy
sales cycles. SpeechWorks may spend significant time and incur substantial
expenses educating and providing information to prospective clients. Any failure
to complete a sale to a prospective client during a quarter could result in
revenues and operating results for the quarter that are lower than expected.

     In addition, as a result of the significant time required to deliver or
perform a client order, SpeechWorks may be unable to recognize revenue related
to a client order until well after SpeechWorks receives the order. SpeechWorks'
dependence on large client orders and the delay in recognizing revenue relating
to these orders makes it difficult to forecast quarterly operating results. This
could cause SpeechWorks' stock price to be volatile or to decline.

  SPEECHWORKS RELIES ON RESELLERS AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS FOR A
  PORTION OF ITS SALES. THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE RESELLERS OR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT
  MANUFACTURERS COULD LIMIT SPEECHWORKS' ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW ITS
  REVENUES.

     For the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, 59.4% of SpeechWorks'
sales were attributable to its resellers and original equipment manufacturers,
or OEMs. For the year ended December 31, 2002, 60.1% of SpeechWorks' sales were
attributable to its resellers and OEMs. In 2001, 58.1% of SpeechWorks' sales
were attributable to its resellers and OEMs, especially InterVoice, Inc., which
accounted for 19.3% of SpeechWorks' sales in 2001. SpeechWorks intends to
increase its sales through resellers in the future. As a result, SpeechWorks is
in part dependent upon the continued success and viability of its resellers and
OEMs, as well as their continued interest in selling SpeechWorks' products. The
loss of a key reseller or OEM or SpeechWorks' failure to develop and sustain new
reseller and OEM relationships could limit SpeechWorks' ability to sustain and
grow its revenues.

     SpeechWorks' contracts with its resellers and OEMs generally do not require
them to purchase SpeechWorks' products. SpeechWorks' resellers and OEMs are
independent companies over which SpeechWorks has limited control. SpeechWorks'
resellers and OEMs could cease to market its products or devote significant
resources to the sale of its products. Any failure of SpeechWorks' resellers or
OEMs to successfully market and sell its products could result in revenues that
are lower than anticipated. In addition, SpeechWorks' resellers and OEMs possess
confidential information concerning its products and operations. Although
SpeechWorks has nondisclosure agreements with its resellers and OEMs, a reseller
or

OEM could use SpeechWorks' confidential information in competition with
SpeechWorks, which competition could adversely affect SpeechWorks' competitive
position and revenues.

  SPEECHWORKS HAS EXPANDED ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF RISKS
  INVOLVED WITH OPERATING A BUSINESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, SPEECHWORKS MAY NOT
  BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING ITS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND
  SPEECHWORKS' BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED.

     SpeechWorks' international sales represented 19.1% of its revenue for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2003, 21.4% of its revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2002, 9.5% of its revenue in 2001 and 14.0% of its revenue in 2000.
SpeechWorks expanded its direct and indirect international sales force in 2001,
which helped SpeechWorks increase its international revenues in 2002.
SpeechWorks has limited experience in international operations and international
product and service sales, and there can be no assurance SpeechWorks will be
successful in its international business. SpeechWorks is subject to a variety of
risks associated with conducting business internationally, in addition to the
risks its business as a whole faces, any of which could harm SpeechWorks'
business. These risks include:

     - difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations,

     - difficulties in establishing and maintaining an effective international
       reseller network,

     - the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, particularly
       with respect to intellectual property and license requirements,

     - political and economic instability outside the United States,

     - import or export licensing and product certification requirements,

     - tariffs, duties, price controls or other restrictions on foreign
       currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries,

     - potential adverse tax consequences, including higher marginal rates,

     - unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and

     - limited ability to enforce agreements, intellectual property rights and
       other rights in some foreign countries.

  IN ORDER TO INCREASE SPEECHWORKS' INTERNATIONAL SALES, SPEECHWORKS MUST
  DEVELOP LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF ITS PRODUCTS. IF SPEECHWORKS IS UNABLE TO DO SO,
  SPEECHWORKS MAY BE UNABLE TO GROW ITS REVENUE AND EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS
  STRATEGY.

     In order to expand SpeechWorks' international sales, SpeechWorks intends to
continue to invest significant resources to create and refine different speech
recognition and synthesis models for particular languages or dialects. These
speech-processing models are required to create versions of SpeechWorks'
products that understand or reproduce the local language or dialect. If
SpeechWorks fails to develop localized versions of its products, SpeechWorks'
ability to address international market opportunities and to grow its business
will be limited. In addition, SpeechWorks is required to invest resources to
develop these versions of its products in advance of the receipt of revenues.
SpeechWorks may be unable to recognize revenues sufficient to render these
products profitable.

  IF SPEECHWORKS FAILS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE FACE OF THE
  INDUSTRY'S RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY, SPEECHWORKS' FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS
  MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

     SpeechWorks' growth and future operating results will depend, in part, on
SpeechWorks' ability to keep pace with:

     - rapidly changing speech recognition and speech synthesis technology,

     - evolving industry standards and practices,

     - frequent new speech-activated service and product introductions and
       enhancements, and

     - changing client requirements and preferences for their automated speech
       systems.

     Any delay or failure on SpeechWorks' part in responding quickly,
cost-effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render
SpeechWorks' existing speech-activated products and services noncompetitive or
obsolete and have an adverse effect on SpeechWorks' competitive position.
SpeechWorks may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its
speech-activated products and services to respond to technological changes.
SpeechWorks must stay abreast of cutting-edge technological developments and
evolving service offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of its
speech-activated services. SpeechWorks must be able to incorporate new
technologies into the speech-activated solutions SpeechWorks designs and
develops to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of SpeechWorks'
client base. If SpeechWorks is unable, for technological or other reasons, to
develop and introduce new and enhanced products and to respond to changing
client requirements and preferences in a timely manner, SpeechWorks may lose
existing customers and fail to attract new customers, which could result in a
significant decline in SpeechWorks' revenues.

  IF SPEECHWORKS DOES NOT MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGING
  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SPEECHWORKS' RESOURCES MAY BE STRAINED, WHICH COULD HARM
  SPEECHWORKS' ABILITY TO BECOME PROFITABLE.

     SpeechWorks' business operations have changed due to volatility in
SpeechWorks' industry. SpeechWorks has experienced significant growth in the
past. From December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001, the number of SpeechWorks
employees increased from 317 to 409. However, in July 2002, SpeechWorks reduced
its headcount by approximately 17%. In January 2003, SpeechWorks further reduced
its headcount by approximately 6%. SpeechWorks' headcount as of March 31, 2003
was 309. SpeechWorks may be required to expand or contract its business
operations in the future, and as a result may need to expand or contract its
management, operational, financial and human resources, as well as management
information systems and controls, to respond to any such growth or contraction.
SpeechWorks' failure to manage these types of changes would place a burden on
SpeechWorks' business and its management team, which could cause SpeechWorks'
business to suffer.

  SPEECHWORKS' APPLICATION SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN
  DELAYED OR LOST REVENUE, EXPENSIVE CORRECTIONS, LIABILITY TO SPEECHWORKS'
  CLIENTS AND CLAIMS AGAINST SPEECHWORKS.

     SpeechWorks designs, develops and implements complex speech-activated
solutions that are often crucial to the operation of SpeechWorks' clients'
products and businesses. Defects in the solutions SpeechWorks develops could
result in delayed or lost revenue, adverse client reaction and negative
publicity about SpeechWorks or its products and services or require expensive
and time consuming corrections. Also, due to the developing nature of speech
recognition technology, text-to-speech technology and speaker verification
technology, SpeechWorks' products are not currently and may never be accurate in
every instance. In addition, third party technology that is included in
SpeechWorks' products could contain errors or defects. Clients who are not
satisfied with SpeechWorks' products or services could bring claims against
SpeechWorks for substantial damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely
be time consuming and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages.
Such claims could have an adverse effect on SpeechWorks' financial results and
competitive position.

  SPEECHWORKS' CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN THE SPEECH-ACTIVATED
  SOLUTIONS MARKET, SOME OF WHOM HAVE GREATER RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE THAN
  SPEECHWORKS DOES, MAY OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY CAUSE DEMAND FOR,
  AND THE PRICES OF, SPEECHWORKS' PRODUCTS TO DECLINE.

     A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products
that compete with SpeechWorks' products. Competitors in speech technology
include AT&T, Elan, Fonix, IBM, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft, Nuance
Communications, Philips Communications, Phonetic Systems, Rhetorical, Telisma
and Temic speech processing. Furthermore, other companies may enter SpeechWorks'
markets by acquiring, or entering into strategic relationships with,
SpeechWorks' competitors. Current and

potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative
relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the abilities
of their advanced speech and language technology products to address the needs
of SpeechWorks' prospective customers.

     Many of SpeechWorks' current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product
development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and/or larger
client bases than SpeechWorks does. SpeechWorks' present or future competitors
may be able to develop speech-activated products and services comparable or
superior to those SpeechWorks offers, adapt more quickly than SpeechWorks does
to new technologies, evolving industry trends and standards or client
requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale
of their products and services than SpeechWorks does. Accordingly, SpeechWorks
may not be able to compete effectively in its markets, competition may intensify
and future competition may cause demand for and the prices of SpeechWorks'
products to decline, which could adversely affect SpeechWorks' sales and
profitability.

  IF THE STANDARDS SPEECHWORKS HAS SELECTED TO SUPPORT ARE NOT ADOPTED AS THE
  INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR SPEECH-ACTIVATED SOFTWARE, BUSINESSES MIGHT NOT USE
  SPEECHWORKS' SPEECH-ACTIVATED SOFTWARE PLATFORMS FOR DELIVERY OF APPLICATIONS
  AND SERVICES, AND SPEECHWORKS REVENUES COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

     The market for speech-activated services software is new and emerging and
industry software standards have not yet been fully established. SpeechWorks may
not be competitive unless its products support changing industry software
standards. The emergence of industry standards other than those SpeechWorks has
selected to support, whether through adoption by official standards committees
or widespread usage, could require costly and time consuming redesign of
SpeechWorks' products. If these standards become widespread and SpeechWorks'
products do not support them, SpeechWorks' clients and potential clients may not
purchase SpeechWorks' products, and SpeechWorks' revenues could be adversely
affected. Multiple standards in the marketplace could also make it difficult for
SpeechWorks to design its products to support all applicable standards, which
could also result in decreased sales of SpeechWorks' products.

  SPEECHWORKS RELIES ON SPEECHWORKS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND IF
  SPEECHWORKS IS UNABLE TO PROTECT THESE RIGHTS, SPEECHWORKS MAY FACE INCREASED
  COMPETITION. PROTECTION OF SPEECHWORKS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS
  UNCERTAIN AND MAY BE COSTLY.

     Intellectual property rights are important in SpeechWorks' industry.
SpeechWorks relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws, as well as confidentiality, assignment of rights to inventions,
and/or license agreements with its employees, consultants and corporate or
strategic partners to protect its intellectual property rights. These legal
protections afford only limited protection and may be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain, maintain and enforce. Further, despite SpeechWorks'
efforts, SpeechWorks may be unable to prevent third parties from unauthorized
use of SpeechWorks' intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized use of
SpeechWorks' intellectual property is difficult, and SpeechWorks cannot be
certain that the steps it has taken will be effective to prevent unauthorized
use.

     Litigation may be necessary to enforce SpeechWorks' intellectual property
rights and trade secrets. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would
likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management's
time and attention away from SpeechWorks' business.

  IF THE PROPOSED MERGER DOES NOT CLOSE, SPEECHWORKS MAY UNDERTAKE STRATEGIC
  ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE AND ANY DIFFICULTIES FROM
  INTEGRATING SUCH ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS COULD DAMAGE SPEECHWORKS' ABILITY
  TO ATTAIN OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF STRATEGIC
  ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS MAY NEVER BE REALIZED.

     If the proposed merger transaction does not close, SpeechWorks may acquire
or make significant investments in businesses and technologies that complement
or augment SpeechWorks' existing business and technologies. Integrating any
newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time-consuming
and could divert management's time and attention away from SpeechWorks' on-going
business.

SpeechWorks may not be able to integrate any acquired business, products,
employees or technology successfully and SpeechWorks' failure to do so could
harm its business. SpeechWorks cannot guarantee that it will realize any
anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments. Moreover,
SpeechWorks may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or
equity financing to acquire or make significant investments in any businesses or
technologies, which may result in dilution to SpeechWorks' current stockholders
and the incurrence of indebtedness. SpeechWorks may not be able to operate
acquired businesses profitably.

  SOME OF SPEECHWORKS' CUSTOMER CONTRACTS INCLUDE RIGHTS OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. IN THE EVENT THAT SPEECHWORKS IS REQUIRED
  TO INDEMNIFY ITS CUSTOMERS THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON ITS
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     SpeechWorks enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary
course of business through its customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements,
SpeechWorks indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified
party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally
SpeechWorks' business partners or customers, in connection with any U.S. patent,
or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third
party with respect to SpeechWorks' products. The term of these indemnification
agreements is generally perpetual from the date of the agreement. The maximum
potential amount of future payments SpeechWorks could be required to make under
these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Although SpeechWorks has not
incurred any material costs to date related to these indemnification agreements,
in the event that any of SpeechWorks' products or solutions were found to
violate intellectual property rights, then amounts paid to SpeechWorks'
customers could have a material adverse effect on SpeechWorks' ongoing
operations.

  SPEECHWORKS MAY EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS OF
  INFRINGEMENT BY THIRD PARTIES, AND IF SPEECHWORKS IS NOT SUCCESSFUL
  SPEECHWORKS MAY LOSE SIGNIFICANT RIGHTS OR BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO
  DISADVANTAGEOUS LICENSE OR ROYALTY AGREEMENTS.

     Currently, in the software industry there are frequent assertions of patent
infringement by owners of patents, and assertions of other violations of
intellectual property rights such as trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
In addition, there are a large number of patents in the speech processing area.
Although SpeechWorks does not believe that it is infringing on any patent
rights, the holders of patents may claim that SpeechWorks is doing so. If any
claim were made against SpeechWorks, SpeechWorks' business could be harmed,
particularly if SpeechWorks is unsuccessful in defending such claim. If
SpeechWorks is forced to defend any claim, whether it is with or without merit
or is determined in SpeechWorks' favor, then SpeechWorks may face costly
litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, delays in future
product releases or injunctions preventing SpeechWorks from selling its products
and services. SpeechWorks may also be required to enter into costly and
burdensome royalty and licensing agreements. Any royalty or licensing
agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to
SpeechWorks, or at all.

  SPEECHWORKS' PRODUCTS INCORPORATE TECHNOLOGY SPEECHWORKS LICENSES FROM OTHERS.
  SPEECHWORKS' INABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE LICENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
  ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS.

     Some of the technology included in, or operating in conjunction with,
SpeechWorks' products is licensed by SpeechWorks from others. For example,
SpeechWorks currently licenses certain text-to-speech technology from IBM,
text-to-speech and other technology relating to computer processing of the human
voice from AT&T, speaker verification technology from Rutgers University and
software and technology from MIT. Certain of these license agreements are for
limited terms. If for any reason these license agreements terminate, SpeechWorks
may be required to seek alternative vendors and may be unable to obtain similar
technology on favorable terms, or at all. If SpeechWorks is unable to obtain
alternative license agreements, SpeechWorks could be required to modify some
features of its products, which could adversely affect sales of its products and
services.

  SPEECHWORKS RELIES UPON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND PERFORMANCE OF A RELATIVELY
  SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND KEY TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SPEECHWORKS MAY
  NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OR RECRUIT NECESSARY PERSONNEL, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE
  MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPEECHWORKS' BUSINESS.

     SpeechWorks' future success depends on its retention of a small number of
senior management and key technical personnel, such as Stuart R. Patterson,
SpeechWorks' President and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael S. Phillips,
SpeechWorks' Chief Technology Officer and co-founder. SpeechWorks does not have
key person life insurance policies covering any of its employees. The loss of
services of any of SpeechWorks' executive officers or key personnel could have a
negative effect on SpeechWorks' ability to grow its business.

     SpeechWorks needs to attract and retain managerial and highly skilled
technical personnel. If SpeechWorks is unable to attract and retain managerial
and qualified technical personnel, SpeechWorks' operations could suffer and
SpeechWorks may never achieve profitability.

  SPEECHWORKS' BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED IF SPEECHWORKS FAILS TO HIRE OR RETAIN
  QUALIFIED SALES PERSONNEL, OR IF NEWLY HIRED SALES PEOPLE FAIL TO DEVELOP THE
  NECESSARY SALES SKILLS OR DEVELOP THESE SKILLS MORE SLOWLY THAN SPEECHWORKS
  ANTICIPATES.

     SpeechWorks' financial success depends to a large degree on the ability of
its direct and indirect sales force to increase sales. Therefore, SpeechWorks'
ability to increase revenue in the future depends considerably upon SpeechWorks'
success in recruiting, training and retaining additional direct and indirect
sales personnel and the success of its sales force. Also, a new salesperson may
require a number of months before he or she becomes a productive member of
SpeechWorks' sales force.

                  THE SPECIAL MEETING OF SCANSOFT STOCKHOLDERS

GENERAL

     ScanSoft is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ScanSoft
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the ScanSoft
board of directors for use at the special meeting of ScanSoft stockholders,
including any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

     The special meeting will be held at the ScanSoft headquarters, 9 Centennial
Drive, Peabody, Massachusetts 01960, on [     ] [  ], 2003 at [     ] Eastern
time.

PURPOSE OF THE SCANSOFT SPECIAL MEETING

     At the ScanSoft special meeting, including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, ScanSoft stockholders will be asked:

          1.  To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the issuance of
     shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with a merger of Spiderman
     Acquisition Corporation with and into SpeechWorks as contemplated by the
     Agreement and Plan of Reorganization among ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition
     Corporation and SpeechWorks, with SpeechWorks surviving as a wholly owned
     subsidiary of ScanSoft;

          2.  To consider and vote upon a proposal to amend ScanSoft's 1995
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for
     issuance under the plan from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000; and

          3.  To transact such other business as may properly come before the
     ScanSoft special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof.

     A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. ScanSoft stockholders are encouraged to read
the merger agreement in its entirety.

THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SCANSOFT SPECIAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO SCANSOFT STOCKHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, SCANSOFT STOCKHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS JOINT
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE
ENCLOSED PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED PRE-ADDRESSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

RECORD DATE, SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE

     Only holders of ScanSoft common stock at the close of business on
[          ], 2003, the record date for the ScanSoft special meeting, are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the ScanSoft special meeting. On the record
date, approximately [          ] shares of ScanSoft common stock were issued and
outstanding and there were approximately [          ] holders of record.
ScanSoft stockholders on the record date are each entitled to one vote per share
of ScanSoft common stock on the proposals described above.

VOTING PROCEDURES

     You may vote in person at the ScanSoft special meeting or by proxy.
ScanSoft recommends that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the
special meeting and vote in person. You can change your vote at the ScanSoft
special meeting at any time before the voting has been completed.

     ScanSoft stockholders holding shares of ScanSoft common stock directly as
stockholders of record or in "street name" may direct the voting of their shares
without attending the ScanSoft special meeting.

ScanSoft stockholders may vote by granting proxies or, for shares held in street
name, by submitting voting instructions to their brokers or nominees.

     ScanSoft stockholders of record may submit proxies by completing, signing
and dating the enclosed proxy card for the ScanSoft special meeting and mailing
them in the enclosed pre-addressed postage-paid envelopes. All shares of
ScanSoft common stock represented by properly executed proxies received in time
for the ScanSoft special meeting and not revoked will be voted at the ScanSoft
special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement of the ScanSoft special
meeting, in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxies. Properly
executed proxies from ScanSoft stockholders holding shares directly as
stockholders of record that do not contain voting instructions will be voted FOR
the approval of the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection
with the merger and FOR the approval of the amendment of the 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

     If your broker holds your shares of ScanSoft common stock for you in
"street name," you should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following
the directions your broker provides to you. Most brokers have procedures for
telephone or Internet voting. Check the material your broker sends you or call
your account representative for more information. In the event you do not
instruct your broker how to vote any shares held for you in street name, your
shares will not be counted as a vote cast on the proposal to approve the
issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger, and
will therefore have no effect on that proposal. In addition, your broker will
have discretionary voting authority on the proposal to approve the amendment of
ScanSoft's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
reserved for issuance under the plan from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000.

     ScanSoft stockholders of record may also vote in person at the special
meeting by submitting their proxy cards or by filling out a ballot at the
ScanSoft special meeting.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Under applicable rules of the NASDAQ National Market, the issuance of
shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger requires an
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the ScanSoft special
meeting.

     The proposal to amend the ScanSoft 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the ScanSoft
special meeting.

QUORUM, ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     A quorum of ScanSoft stockholders is required to have a valid ScanSoft
special meeting of stockholders. A majority of the shares of ScanSoft common
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date must be
present in person or by proxy at the ScanSoft special meeting in order for a
quorum to be established. ScanSoft's transfer agent will act as inspector of
elections at the ScanSoft special meeting and will ascertain whether a quorum is
present, tabulate the votes and determine the voting results on all matters
presented to the ScanSoft stockholders at the special meeting. If a quorum is
not present, ScanSoft expects that the ScanSoft special meeting will be
adjourned to allow additional time to obtain additional proxies or votes, and at
any subsequent reconvening of the ScanSoft special meeting, all proxies will be
voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been voted at the original
convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been
effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the reconvening of the ScanSoft
special meeting.

     Under the rules that govern brokers who have record ownership of shares
that are held in "street name" for their clients, the beneficial owners of the
shares, brokers have discretion to vote these shares on routine matters but not
on non-routine matters. The approval of the issuance of shares of ScanSoft
common stock in connection with the merger is considered a non-routine matter,
and the adoption of the amendment to the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan at
the special meeting is considered a routine matter. Accordingly, brokers will
have discretionary voting authority to vote your shares at the special

meeting on the proposal to approve the plan amendment, but not on the proposal
to approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with
the merger.

     A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker returns a signed and dated proxy
but fails to vote on a proposal, such as when a broker does not have
discretionary voting authority and has not received instructions from the
beneficial owners of the shares. A broker will not be permitted to vote on the
share issuance without instruction from the owner of the shares of ScanSoft
common stock held by that broker. Broker "non-votes" count as present for
purposes of establishing a quorum described above, but will not be counted as a
vote cast on either the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft
common stock in connection with the merger or the proposal to approve the plan
amendment, and will therefore have no effect on those proposals. ScanSoft
stockholders are urged to return the enclosed proxy card marked to indicate
their vote or to instruct their broker to vote shares held in "street name."

     Abstentions will have the effect of being cast against the proposal to
approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the
merger and against the proposal to approve the plan amendment, even though the
stockholder so abstaining may intend a different interpretation.

SHARES OWNED AND VOTED BY SCANSOFT DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     At the close of business on the record date for the ScanSoft special
meeting, directors and executive officers of ScanSoft beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [       ] shares of ScanSoft common
stock. These shares represent approximately [  ]% of the ScanSoft common stock
outstanding as of the record date.

     Each of these individuals has entered into a voting agreement with
SpeechWorks in which he or she has agreed, among other things, to vote all
shares of ScanSoft common stock beneficially owned by him or her in favor of the
approval of the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with
the merger, against any other acquisition proposal and against any action that
would delay or prevent the merger. In connection with and in support of the
voting agreements, these persons have granted an irrevocable proxy to an
affiliate of SpeechWorks to vote the shares in accordance with the terms of the
voting agreements.

REVOKING YOUR PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is voted at the
ScanSoft special meeting by:

     - submitting a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of
       ScanSoft at 9 Centennial Drive, Peabody, Massachusetts 01960 bearing a
       later date than the proxy;

     - granting a duly executed proxy relating to the same shares and bearing a
       later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) and delivering
       it to the corporate secretary of ScanSoft; or

     - by attending the ScanSoft special meeting and voting in person.

     Simply attending the ScanSoft special meeting will not revoke a proxy. If
you do not hold your shares of ScanSoft common stock in your own name, you may
revoke a previously granted proxy by following the revocation instructions
provided by the bank, broker or other party that is the registered owner of the
shares.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks will share equally expenses incurred in connection
with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
ScanSoft will be responsible for any fees incurred in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for the ScanSoft special meeting. In addition to
solicitation by mail, the directors, officers, employees and agents of ScanSoft
may solicit proxies from ScanSoft stockholders by telephone or other electronic
means or in person. Some of these individuals may have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of ScanSoft
stockholders generally. See the section entitled "The Merger -- Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger -- Interests

of ScanSoft Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." Brokerage houses
and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries will be requested to forward
soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by these
persons, and ScanSoft will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners.

OTHER MATTERS

     The ScanSoft board of directors is not aware of any other business to be
brought before the ScanSoft special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
of the meeting. If, however, other matters are properly brought before the
ScanSoft special meeting (including any proposal to adjourn the special meeting
to allow ScanSoft additional time to solicit proxies in favor of the proposal to
approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the
merger or the proposal to approve the amendment to the 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan) or an adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons appointed
as proxies will have discretionary authority to vote the ScanSoft shares
represented by duly executed proxies in accordance with their discretion and
judgment.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE SCANSOFT BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After careful consideration, the ScanSoft board of directors has
unanimously determined it advisable and in the best interests of ScanSoft and
its stockholders that ScanSoft proceed with the merger and that the terms of the
merger agreement are fair to ScanSoft and its stockholders, and unanimously
recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of
ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger and FOR the proposal to
approve the amendment to the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

     In considering such recommendation, ScanSoft stockholders should be aware
that some ScanSoft directors and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of ScanSoft stockholders generally. See
the section entitled "The Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger -- Interests of ScanSoft Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

IN THE ENCLOSED PRE-ADDRESSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

RECORD DATE, SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE

     Only holders of SpeechWorks common stock at the close of business on
[       ], 2003, the record date for the SpeechWorks special meeting, are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the SpeechWorks special meeting. On the
record date, approximately [          ] shares of SpeechWorks common stock were

SpeechWorks stockholders on the record date are each entitled to one vote per
share of SpeechWorks common stock on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and approve the merger.

VOTING PROCEDURES

     You may vote in person at the SpeechWorks special meeting or by proxy.
SpeechWorks recommends that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the
special meeting and vote in person. You can change your vote at the SpeechWorks
special meeting at any time before the voting has been completed.

     SpeechWorks stockholders holding shares of SpeechWorks common stock
directly as stockholders of record or in "street name" may direct the voting of
their shares without attending the SpeechWorks special meeting. SpeechWorks
stockholders may vote by granting proxies or, for shares held in street name, by
submitting voting instructions to their brokers or nominees.

     SpeechWorks stockholders of record may submit proxies by completing,
signing and dating the enclosed proxy card for the SpeechWorks special meeting
and mailing them in the enclosed pre-addressed postage-paid envelopes. All
shares of SpeechWorks common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the special meeting and not revoked will be voted at the
SpeechWorks special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement of the
meeting, in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxies. Properly
executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

     If your broker holds your shares of SpeechWorks common stock for you in
"street name," you should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following
the directions your broker provides to you. Most brokers have procedures for
telephone or Internet voting. Check the material your broker sends you or call
your account representative for more information. In the event you do not
instruct your broker how to vote any shares held for you in street name, your
shares will not be voted for the adoption of the merger agreement and approval
of the merger.

     SpeechWorks stockholders of record may also vote in person at the
SpeechWorks special meeting by submitting their proxy cards or by completing a
ballot at the SpeechWorks special meeting.

VOTE REQUIRED

     In order for the merger to become effective, the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of SpeechWorks common stock as of the record date must
vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. As discussed below,
abstentions and broker non-votes will each have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

QUORUM, ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     A quorum of SpeechWorks stockholders is required to have a valid
SpeechWorks special meeting of stockholders. A majority of the shares of
SpeechWorks common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the
record date must be present in person or by proxy at the SpeechWorks special
meeting in order for a quorum to be established. SpeechWorks' transfer agent
will act as inspector of elections at the special meeting and will ascertain
whether a quorum is present, tabulate the votes and determine the voting results
on all matters presented to the SpeechWorks stockholders at the special meeting.
If a quorum is not present, SpeechWorks expects that the SpeechWorks special
meeting will be adjourned to allow additional time to obtain additional proxies
or votes, and at any subsequent reconvening of the SpeechWorks special meeting,
all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been
voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies
that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the reconvening of the
SpeechWorks special meeting.

     Under the rules that govern brokers who have record ownership of shares
that are held in "street name" for their clients, the beneficial owners of the
shares, brokers have discretion to vote these shares on routine matters but not
on non-routine matters. The adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the merger at the special meeting are considered non-routine matters.
Accordingly, brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to vote your
shares at the special meeting. A "broker non-vote" occurs when brokers do not
have discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions from the
beneficial owners of the shares. A broker will not be permitted to vote on the
merger proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares of
SpeechWorks common stock held by that broker. Abstentions and broker "non-votes"
count as present for purposes of establishing a quorum described above, but will
not be voted on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger. Consequently, an abstention and broker non-vote will have the same
effect as a vote against the proposal. SpeechWorks stockholders are urged to
return the enclosed proxy card marked to indicate their vote or to instruct
their broker to vote shares held in "street name."

SHARES OWNED AND VOTED BY SPEECHWORKS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     At the close of business on the record date for the SpeechWorks special
meeting, directors and executive officers of SpeechWorks beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [       ] shares of SpeechWorks common
stock. These shares represent approximately [  ]% of the SpeechWorks common

of the voting agreements, these persons have granted an irrevocable proxy to an
affiliate of ScanSoft to vote the shares in accordance with the terms of the
voting agreements.

REVOKING YOUR PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is voted at the
SpeechWorks special meeting by:

     - submitting a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of
       SpeechWorks at 695 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02111 bearing a
       later date than the proxy;

     - granting a duly executed proxy relating to the same shares and bearing a
       later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) and delivering
       it to the corporate secretary of SpeechWorks; or

     - by attending the SpeechWorks special meeting and voting in person.

     Simply attending the SpeechWorks special meeting will not revoke a proxy.
If you do not hold your shares of SpeechWorks common stock in your own name, you
may revoke a previously granted proxy by following the revocation instructions
provided by the bank, broker or other party that is the registered owner of the
shares.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

OTHER MATTERS

     The SpeechWorks board of directors is not aware of any other business to be
brought before the SpeechWorks special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the meeting. If, however, other matters are properly brought
before the SpeechWorks special meeting (including any proposal to adjourn the
special meeting to allow SpeechWorks additional time to solicit proxies in favor
of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement) or an adjournment or postponement
thereof, the persons appointed as proxies will have discretionary authority to
vote the shares of SpeechWorks common stock represented by duly executed proxies
in accordance with their discretion and judgment.

     After careful consideration, the SpeechWorks board of directors has
unanimously determined it advisable and in the best interests of SpeechWorks and
its stockholders that SpeechWorks proceed with the merger and that the terms of
the merger agreement are fair to SpeechWorks and its stockholders, and
unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to adopt the merger

     In considering such recommendation, SpeechWorks stockholders should be
aware that some SpeechWorks directors and officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of SpeechWorks stockholders
generally. See the section entitled "The Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons
in the Merger -- Interests of SpeechWorks Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger."

                                   THE MERGER

     The following is a description of the material aspects of the proposed
merger and related transactions. The following description may not contain all
of the information that is important to you. You should read this entire joint
proxy statement/prospectus, including the section entitled "Agreements Related
to the Merger," and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more
complete understanding of the merger and the related transactions.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Both ScanSoft and SpeechWorks regularly evaluate different strategies for
improving their competitive positions and enhancing stockholder value, including
opportunities for mergers with other companies, acquisitions of other companies
or assets, and licensing, marketing and development alliances.

     In September 2002, Mr. Stuart Patterson, Chief Executive Officer of
SpeechWorks, and Mr. Richard Westelman, Chief Financial Officer of SpeechWorks,
met with representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to discuss the
possibility of retaining Morgan Stanley to advise SpeechWorks in connection with
its consideration of specific strategic business opportunities. In October 2002,
SpeechWorks engaged Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor.

     On October 18, 2002, Mr. Paul Ricci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of ScanSoft, and Mr. Patterson had a preliminary meeting to discuss ScanSoft's
recent announcement of its planned acquisition of Philips' speech processing
telephony and voice control business. At this meeting, they discussed the
possibility of a potential business combination of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks. Mr.
Ricci and Mr. Patterson discussed the complementary nature of the respective
companies' technologies, assets and business strategies.

     On October 25, 2002, Mr. Ricci and Mr. Patterson, along with certain other
members of SpeechWorks management, met to discuss the benefits of a potential
business combination of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks and the potential synergies
resulting from a combined company, as well as potential structures of a combined
management team. They proposed a series of meetings between senior management
teams of the respective companies to identify synergies and investigate
strategic merits.

     On November 8, 2002, Mr. Ricci and Mr. Patterson met and discussed
valuation methodologies. Mr. Ricci and Mr. Patterson concluded that it was
advisable to continue discussions concerning a potential merger.

     On November 13, 2002, Ms. Jeanne McCann, Senior Vice President of Speech
and Language Research and Development of ScanSoft, and Mr. Michael Phillips,
Senior Vice President of SpeechWorks, met to discuss the resources and strengths
of their respective organizations. Mr. Michael Tivnan, former President and

CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER BY SCANSOFT

  SCANSOFT'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE SCANSOFT BOARD OF
  DIRECTORS

     The ScanSoft board of directors considered a number of alternatives for
enhancing its competitive position in the speech technology markets and
increasing stockholder value. The ScanSoft board of directors believes that the
proposed merger is in the best interest of ScanSoft and its stockholders. The
ScanSoft board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
merger and determined to recommend that its stockholders approve the issuance of
shares of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger. This decision was
based on a number of factors, including the potential benefits that the ScanSoft
board of directors believes will contribute to the future success of the
combined company. These benefits include:

     - the ability of the combined company to promote its products and
       comprehensively address the needs of the system integrators in the United
       States telephony markets;

     - SpeechWorks' strong professional services organization would enable the
       combined company to support major accounts, channel partners and
       telecommunications firms, as well as deliver complete solutions;

     - increased combined technical depth in the face of AT&T's, Microsoft's and
       IBM's investments in speech technology;

     - addition of strengths in key vertical markets, including multiple
       deployments in travel/hospitality, financial services and government,
       which would expand ScanSoft's expertise in developing applications and
       solutions for these industries;

     - the strength of the SpeechWorks management team and the ability of the
       combined company to employ the skills and resources of the combined
       management teams;

     - the transaction is expected to achieve synergies from the research and
       development, marketing, sales and administrative areas of the combined
       company following the merger;

     - the complementary nature of the technologies of the combined company;

     - SpeechWorks' complete portfolio of technologies for distributed
       conversational user interface applications; and

     - SpeechWorks' position as a leading provider of Speech technologies to the
       telephony market and the strength of their customer base.

     The ScanSoft board of directors evaluated all of the potential benefits
described above in light of their knowledge of ScanSoft's business, financial
condition and prospects, SpeechWorks' business, financial condition and
prospects, and the market for speech technology solutions. The ScanSoft board of
directors also identified and considered potentially negative factors that could
result from the merger, including the risks posed by the necessary integration
of the businesses and operations of the two companies and the risk that the
combined company will not be able to fully realize potential synergies and cost
saving opportunities. In addition, the ScanSoft board of directors considered a
number of other factors in evaluating the proposed merger, including
presentations given by ScanSoft's management and the opinion of Evercore
Partners as financial advisor to ScanSoft. In view of the variety of factors
considered by the ScanSoft board of directors in its evaluation of the merger,
the ScanSoft board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered
in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of the ScanSoft board
of directors may have given different weight to different factors. While the
list of potential benefits described in this section as having been considered
by the ScanSoft board of directors is not intended to be the complete list of
all of the potential benefits considered, it is believed to include the
potential benefits considered by the ScanSoft board of directors to be material.

     The ScanSoft board of directors believes that the merger is advisable, and
is fair to and in the best interests of ScanSoft and its stockholders, and
recommends that ScanSoft stockholders approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft
common stock in connection with the merger.

  OPINION OF SCANSOFT FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     ScanSoft retained Evercore Partners to act as financial advisor to
ScanSoft. On April 23, 2003, Evercore Partners delivered its oral opinion, which
was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the ScanSoft board of directors that,
as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth therein, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
ScanSoft.

     The full text of the written opinion of Evercore Partners is set forth as
Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and describes the assumptions
made, general procedures followed, matters considered and limits and
qualifications on the review undertaken by Evercore Partners and is incorporated
herein by reference. Evercore Partners' opinion is directed only to whether the
exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to ScanSoft and does not
constitute a recommendation to any ScanSoft stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to the merger. The summary of the opinion
of Evercore Partners set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of such opinion. STOCKHOLDERS OF SCANSOFT ARE URGED TO READ THE
OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore Partners, among other
things:

     - analyzed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       publicly available information relating to SpeechWorks and ScanSoft;

     - analyzed certain internal financial statements and other non-public
       financial and operating data relating to SpeechWorks and ScanSoft that
       were prepared and furnished to Evercore Partners by the managements of
       SpeechWorks and ScanSoft;

     - analyzed certain internal financial projections relating to SpeechWorks
       and ScanSoft that were prepared and furnished to Evercore Partners by the
       managements of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft;

     - discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and
       current financial condition of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft with the
       managements of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft;

     - reviewed certain internal presentations that the management of ScanSoft
       has previously made to the ScanSoft board of directors describing
       ScanSoft's customers, competitors and strategy;

     - reviewed the reported prices, trading activity and valuation multiples
       for each of SpeechWorks common stock and ScanSoft common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of SpeechWorks and the prices, trading
       activity and valuation multiples of the SpeechWorks common stock with
       that of certain other publicly-traded companies and their securities that
       Evercore Partners deemed relevant;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent available, of certain
       comparable transactions and compared them to the proposed financial terms
       of the merger;

     - reviewed certain information concerning cost savings and combination
       benefits expected to result from the merger that was prepared by and
       furnished to Evercore Partners by the management of ScanSoft, including
       the amounts and timing of such synergies and related expenses;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, and their advisors;

     - reviewed the merger agreement in substantially final form and assumed
       that the final form of such merger agreement would not vary in any
       respect material to Evercore Partners' analysis; and

     - performed other examinations and analyses and considered other factors
       that Evercore Partners deemed appropriate.

     For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore Partners assumed and
relied upon, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification
of, the accuracy and completeness of the information publicly available, and the
information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed
by or for Evercore Partners. With respect to the financial projections of
ScanSoft and SpeechWorks and the underlying analysis concerning the potential
synergies which were furnished to Evercore Partners, or discussed with Evercore
Partners or reviewed for Evercore Partners by the managements of ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks, Evercore Partners assumed that they have been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of the future competitive, operating and regulatory environments and
related financial performance of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks. Evercore Partners
further assumed that, in all material respects, such financial projections and
synergies would be realized in the amounts and times indicated thereby. Evercore
Partners expressed no view as to such financial projections or synergies, or the
assumptions on which they were based. Additionally, Evercore Partners relied on
ScanSoft management's views as to the future strategic benefits of the merger.

     Evercore Partners did not make nor assume any responsibility for making any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks, nor was Evercore Partners furnished with any such appraisals, nor
did Evercore Partners evaluate the solvency or fair value of SpeechWorks or
ScanSoft under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar matters. Evercore Partners' opinion is necessarily based on economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information and merger
agreement made available to Evercore Partners as of, the date of the opinion.
Evercore Partners assumed the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Evercore Partners did not evaluate, nor did ScanSoft request Evercore
Partners to evaluate, alternative transaction structures or other financial
alternatives other than the merger. Evercore Partners' opinion does not address
ScanSoft's underlying business decision to effect the merger nor constitute a
recommendation to any ScanSoft stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote with respect to the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in
connection with the merger. Furthermore, Evercore Partners expresses no opinion
as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of ScanSoft common stock
will trade at any future time.

     For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore Partners assumed, in all
respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of
each party contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, that each
party will perform all the covenants and agreements required under the merger
agreement, and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be
satisfied without waiver thereof. Evercore Partners also assumed that in the
course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other approvals (contractual or
otherwise) for the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments and modifications, will be imposed that will have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

     In connection with a presentation to the ScanSoft board of directors on
April 23, 2003, Evercore Partners advised the ScanSoft board of directors that,
in evaluating the fairness of the exchange ratio, Evercore Partners performed a
variety of financial analyses with respect to ScanSoft and SpeechWorks. The
following is a summary of the material analyses contained in the presentation.
Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in
tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more
fully understand the financial analyses performed by Evercore Partners, the
tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Evercore Partners reviewed the daily
closing prices of ScanSoft common stock and SpeechWorks common stock to
determine the implied exchange ratio based upon the relative prices of these
securities for each considered time period. Evercore Partners analyzed the
implied exchange ratio between ScanSoft common stock and SpeechWorks common
stock for various time periods between January 1, 2001 and April 22, 2003.
Evercore Partners noted that the exchange ratio in the

merger of 0.860 was within the range of historical implied exchange ratios in
the periods examined. The historical implied exchange ratios for the periods
examined are shown below:

PERIOD                                             IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO

     Comparable Public Company Analysis.  Evercore Partners compared selected
financial, market and operating information of SpeechWorks with corresponding
data of selected publicly traded companies with operations Evercore Partners
deemed to be similar in some respect to those of SpeechWorks for purposes of
this analysis. In such analysis, Evercore Partners compared the multiples of
enterprise value to certain financial data of SpeechWorks on a stand alone basis
as well as based on the terms of the merger to the corresponding multiples for
the selected comparable companies. The multiples that were analyzed by Evercore
Partners were derived by dividing (i) the enterprise value of each company
(based on closing stock prices on April 22, 2003) by its actual 2002 and
estimated 2003 revenues and earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), and
(ii) the stock price of each company on April 22, 2003 by its actual 2002 and
estimated 2003 earnings per share. Evercore Partners divided the selected
comparable companies into three subgroups as follows:

Speech Recognition Software Companies:

     - Nuance Communications, Inc.

     - ScanSoft, Inc.

Enterprise-Focused Voice Software Systems and Applications Companies:

     - Aspect Communications Corp.

     - Avaya Inc.

     - Brooktrout Inc.

     - Interactive Intelligence Inc.

     - Inter-Tel Inc.

     - InterVoice Brite Inc.

     - S1 Corp.

Carrier-Focused Voice Software Systems and Applications Companies:

     - Comverse Technology, Inc.

     - NMS Communications Corporation

     - Sonus Networks, Inc.

     For ScanSoft and SpeechWorks, projections were based on ScanSoft
management's estimates for 2003. For the comparable companies, projections were
based on publicly available Wall Street research estimates.

     To illustrate, Evercore Partners highlighted the multiples of enterprise
value to actual 2002 revenue and projected 2003 revenue. Evercore Partners then
derived reference ranges of such multiples from this analysis. Evercore Partners
noted that the valuation multiples for SpeechWorks based on the terms of the
merger fall within the range found for the selected companies.

                                                                   ENTERPRISE VALUE TO:

     Evercore Partners noted that no company used in the comparable company
analyses summarized above is identical to SpeechWorks. Evercore Partners noted
that because of the differences between the business mix, operations and other
characteristics of SpeechWorks and the comparable public companies, Evercore
Partners believed that an appropriate use of the comparable public company
analysis would also involve qualitative judgments concerning the differences
between SpeechWorks and the comparable companies which would affect the public
trading values of the common stock of the companies. Accordingly, any analysis
of the fairness of the exchange ratio involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in the financial and operating characteristics
of the comparable companies and other factors in relation to the trading values
of the comparable companies.

     Precedent Transactions Analysis.  Evercore Partners reviewed and analyzed
the implied transaction multiples paid in selected merger and acquisition
transactions in the voice software systems and applications industry that
Evercore Partners deemed to be similar in some respect to the merger and

compared these multiples to the multiples implied for SpeechWorks based on the
terms of the merger. The following table sets forth the transactions that were
used for purposes of this analysis:

             ACQUIROR                                      TARGET

             ScanSoft               Philips Speech Processing Telephony and Voice Control

     To illustrate, Evercore Partners calculated the multiples of enterprise
value to actual revenue for the last twelve months. Evercore Partners noted that
the valuation multiple for SpeechWorks based on the terms of the merger falls

     Among other factors, Evercore Partners noted that the merger and
acquisition transaction environment varies over time because of macroeconomic
factors such as interest rate and equity market fluctuations and microeconomic
factors such as industry results and growth expectations. Evercore Partners
noted that no transaction used in the comparable transaction analysis summarized
above is identical to the terms of the proposed merger. Accordingly, the
analysis performed by Evercore Partners involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the comparable transactions and other factors in relation to the acquisition
values of the comparable companies.

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  Evercore Partners analyzed the premiums paid
relative to public market pre-announcement trading prices for a selected group
of transactions that Evercore Partners deemed to be similar in some respect to
the merger and compared these premiums to the premium implied for SpeechWorks
based on the terms of the merger.

     Evercore Partners identified and analyzed seven transactions that occurred
since 1997 in the voice software systems and applications industry involving
companies that Evercore Partners deemed to be similar to SpeechWorks for the
purposes of this analysis. Evercore Partners also identified and analyzed a
group of 20 acquisitions in the broader software industry that were announced
since January 1, 2002. Additionally, Evercore Partners identified and analyzed a
group of 32 acquisitions with enterprise values between $50 million and $175
million in all industries that were announced since January 1, 2001.

     Evercore Partners calculated and compared the premiums paid in these
transactions based on the value of the per share consideration received in the
transaction relative to the closing stock price of the

target company one day and four weeks prior to the respective date of
announcement of the transaction and relative to the one year average trading
price and one year high trading price prior to announcement. The premium
calculations for SpeechWorks based on the terms of the merger are based upon an
assumed announcement date of April 23, 2003. Evercore Partners noted that the
premiums for SpeechWorks based on the terms of the merger generally fall within
the range found for the selected transactions. This analysis produced the
following results:

     Among other factors, Evercore Partners noted that the merger and
acquisition transaction environment varies over time because of the
macroeconomic factors such as interest rate and equity market fluctuations and
microeconomic factors such as industry results and growth expectations. Evercore
Partners noted that no transaction used in the premiums paid analysis summarized
above is identical to the merger. Accordingly, the analysis performed by
Evercore Partners involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the comparable
transactions and other factors in relation to the acquisition values of the
comparable companies.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Relying on ScanSoft management's estimates
of the projected financial performance of SpeechWorks, Evercore Partners
estimated the present value of the future stand alone, unlevered free cash flows
that could be produced by SpeechWorks. Evercore Partners estimated a range of
theoretical values for SpeechWorks based on the net present value of its implied
annual cash flows and a terminal value in 2007 calculated based upon perpetual
growth rates of free cash flow, and adjusted for SpeechWorks estimated net cash
balance as of June 30, 2003. Evercore Partners used a range of discount rates
from 13.0% to 17.0%, a range of terminal value perpetual growth rates from 3.0%
to 6.0% relative to estimated 2007 free cash flow, and an assumed net cash
balance of $36.5 million. Perpetual growth rates were based on assumed long-term
industry growth rates prevailing in 2007. The discount rates were based on
weighted average cost of capital computations and qualitative assessments of
SpeechWorks' projected results and the risks inherent therein. This analysis
indicated values per share of SpeechWorks common stock ranging from $1.81 to
$3.10.

     Relying on ScanSoft management's estimates of the projected financial
performance of SpeechWorks and estimated synergies resulting from the merger,
Evercore Partners estimated the present value of the future, unlevered free cash
flows, including expected operating cost synergies of approximately

$27.5 million for a full year that could be produced through a combination with
SpeechWorks, and net of one-time costs to achieve these synergies of
approximately $10.1 million. Evercore Partners estimated a range of theoretical
values for SpeechWorks based on the net present value of its implied annual cash
flows and a terminal value in 2007 calculated based upon perpetual growth rates
of free cash flow, and adjusted for SpeechWorks estimated net cash balance as of
June 30, 2003. Evercore Partners used a range of discount rates of 13.0% to
17.0%, a range of terminal value perpetual growth rates of 3.0% to 6.0% relative
to estimated 2007 free cash flow, and an assumed net cash balance of $45.8
million, which includes $9.3 million in estimated cash proceeds from the
exercise of SpeechWorks' in the money options based on the per share closing
price of SpeechWorks common stock on April 22, 2003. Perpetual growth rates were
based on assumed long-term industry growth rates prevailing in 2007. The
discount rates were based on weighted average cost of capital computations and
qualitative assessments of SpeechWorks' projected results and the synergies and
the risks inherent therein. This analysis indicated values per share of
SpeechWorks common stock ranging from $4.87 to $8.35.

     Contribution Analysis.  Evercore Partners analyzed the relative
contributions of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks to the pro forma combined company with
respect to a selected group of operating and financial statistics for the
historical year 2002 and the projected years 2003 and 2004. Evercore Partners
also reviewed the pro forma ownership of the combined company, taking into
account ScanSoft's outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of
ScanSoft common stock treated under the treasury stock method and assuming that
all SpeechWorks in the money options are converted into shares of ScanSoft
common stock. For each of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks, Evercore Partners utilized
ScanSoft management's estimates.

     To illustrate, Evercore Partners calculated the relative revenue
contributions of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks to the pro forma combined company.
Evercore Partners also calculated adjusted revenue contribution, which was
defined to incorporate cash balances for both companies by valuing revenue at a
2x multiple (using information derived from the comparable public company
analysis and the precedent transaction analysis described above) and net cash at
face value to adjust for the capital structures of the two companies. Evercore
Partners compared the relative ownership percentages implied by this analysis to
the relative ownership percentages implied for the stockholders of the companies
by the exchange ratio in the merger.

    $16.5 million.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Relying on ScanSoft management's estimates,
Evercore Partners analyzed the potential pro forma effects of the merger on
ScanSoft's estimated 2003 and 2004 earnings per share before amortization and
nonrecurring restructuring charges and ScanSoft's earnings per share after
amortization but before nonrecurring restructuring charges based on various
assumptions regarding the merger. Evercore Partners performed such analysis due
to the fact that several Wall Street research

analysts use earnings per share before amortization and nonrecurring charges,
among other measurements, as a valuation measurement. This analysis, taking into
account certain operating cost synergies estimated by ScanSoft management,
indicated that the merger would be accretive to ScanSoft's projected earnings
per share before amortization and nonrecurring restructuring charges in 2003 and
2004. The merger, taking into account certain operating cost synergies estimated
by ScanSoft management, would be dilutive to ScanSoft's projected earnings per
share after amortization but before nonrecurring restructuring charges in 2003
and accretive in 2004. The actual results achieved by the combined company may
vary from projected results and the variations may be material.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Selecting portions of the analysis or the summary set
forth above, without considering the analysis as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the opinion of Evercore Partners. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore Partners considered the results
of all these constituent analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to
any particular factor or analysis considered by it; rather, Evercore Partners
made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all such analyses.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative
of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore Partners. As
described above, Evercore Partners' opinion to the ScanSoft board of directors
was among the many factors taken into consideration by the ScanSoft board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
parties to the merger agreement determined the exchange ratio based on the
result of arms' length negotiations, and Evercore Partners was not asked to, and
did not, propose any alternative exchange ratio to the ScanSoft board of
directors.

     Evercore Partners is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that
is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions. ScanSoft retained Evercore Partners
based on these qualifications as well as its familiarity with ScanSoft. Evercore
Partners has previously provided various investment banking and financial
advisory services to ScanSoft, for which Evercore Partners received customary
fees for the rendering of those services.

     Pursuant to the terms of an engagement letter with Evercore Partners,
ScanSoft agreed to pay Evercore Partners a fee equal to $175,000 upon delivery
of the fairness opinion and $825,000 upon the closing of the merger.
Additionally, ScanSoft has agreed to issue a warrant to purchase an aggregate of
150,000 shares of ScanSoft common stock to Evercore Partners upon the closing of
the merger. This warrant will have a strike price equal to the average closing
price of ScanSoft common stock on the NASDAQ National Market for five
consecutive trading days, starting two days before and ending two days after
closing, will not be exercisable for three years and will have a term of eight
years. Whether or not the merger is completed, ScanSoft has agreed under the
engagement letter to reimburse Evercore Partners for all its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its
counsel, incurred in connection with its engagement by ScanSoft, and to
indemnify Evercore Partners against liabilities, including liabilities under
federal securities law, and expenses in connection with its engagement.

CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER BY SPEECHWORKS

  SPEECHWORKS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPEECHWORKS
  BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
the SpeechWorks board of directors identified and considered a number of
potential benefits for SpeechWorks and its stockholders

that supported the SpeechWorks board of directors' decision to approve the
merger agreement and the merger. These potential benefits include the following:

     - the belief that the combination of the product lines, sales channels and
       financial resources of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks will result in a combined
       company that is a leader in the speech recognition and imaging
       technologies market;

     - the ability to better serve the customer base of each company with an
       expanded portfolio of technologies and applications, and a deeper set of
       services and support capabilities;

     - the opportunity for each company to introduce its complementary product
       lines into the customer base of the other company;

     - the greater global presence of the combined company, which will include
       representation in more than 70 countries with speech solutions that
       support 45 languages, and employ approximately 800 individuals, with
       nearly half located internationally;

     - the revenue diversification of the combined company, as compared to
       SpeechWorks' primary reliance on sub-segments of the speech recognition
       technology market;

     - the expected synergies and cost-saving opportunities that should result
       from office site consolidations and eliminating redundant operations; and

     - the belief that the merger would combine two experienced and respected
       management teams, resulting in a combined management team that is
       stronger than the management teams of each of the individual companies.

     In addition to the potential benefits accruing to SpeechWorks and its
stockholders from the merger, the SpeechWorks board of directors also considered
a number of other factors in approving the merger, including the following:

     - the number of shares of ScanSoft common stock to be exchanged pursuant to
       the merger for each share of SpeechWorks common stock, and the premium
       that such exchange ratio represented over the then current market price
       of SpeechWorks common stock;

     - SpeechWorks management's view of the business and prospects of
       SpeechWorks and ScanSoft as stand-alone companies and as a combined
       company, including the strategic options which might become available to
       SpeechWorks if it were or were not to proceed with the merger and the
       effectiveness of the merger in implementing and accelerating SpeechWorks'
       long-term growth strategy;

     - the belief that a merger with ScanSoft could enhance SpeechWorks' ability
       to compete with larger, better-financed competitors by providing
       SpeechWorks with access to the financial resources, distribution
       channels, client base and industry contacts of ScanSoft;

     - historical information concerning SpeechWorks' and ScanSoft's respective
       businesses, financial performance and common stock market prices and
       trading information;

     - the intent that the merger be tax-free to SpeechWorks' U.S. stockholders
       who receive shares of ScanSoft common stock in exchange for their
       SpeechWorks common stock pursuant to the merger (except to the extent
       they receive cash for any fractional shares);

     - the financial analyses and presentation of Morgan Stanley & Co.
       Incorporated delivered to the SpeechWorks board of directors on April 23,
       2003, as well as its opinion of the same date that, as of such date, and
       based on and subject to the assumptions, considerations and limitations
       set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.860 shares of ScanSoft
       common stock for each share of SpeechWorks common stock in the merger
       agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
       SpeechWorks common stock (a copy of such written opinion is attached as
       Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus);

     - the results of the due diligence investigation of ScanSoft conducted by
       SpeechWorks' management, financial advisor, accountants and legal
       counsel;

     - the SpeechWorks board of directors' own knowledge of SpeechWorks,
       ScanSoft and their respective businesses;

     - the likelihood of the merger being approved by the appropriate regulatory
       authorities;

     - the contractual terms of the merger agreement and related transaction
       documents; and

     - the interest that certain SpeechWorks officers and directors may have in
       the merger, in addition to their interest as SpeechWorks stockholders,
       (as described in the section entitled "The Merger -- Interests of Certain
       Persons in the Merger -- Interests of SpeechWorks Directors and Executive
       Officers in the Merger").

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
the SpeechWorks board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors that could result from the merger, including the
following:

     - the risks that the integration of the businesses, products and personnel
       of the two companies will not be successfully implemented and may require
       a significant amount of management time and resources;

     - the risk that the potential synergies and cost-saving opportunities
       identified by ScanSoft and SpeechWorks will not be fully realized or not
       fully realized in the time frame anticipated;

     - the risk that the merger may not be completed and the effect of the
       public announcement of the merger on the retention of SpeechWorks'
       customers, business partners and employees;

     - the significant cost that will be incurred in seeking to complete the
       merger; and

     - the other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the
       section entitled "Risk Factors."

     The SpeechWorks board of directors evaluated all of the factors described
above in light of their knowledge of SpeechWorks' business, financial condition
and prospects, ScanSoft's business, financial condition and prospects, and the
market for speech technology solutions. In view of the variety of factors
considered by the SpeechWorks board of directors in its evaluation of the
merger, the SpeechWorks board of directors did not find it practicable to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors
considered in reaching its decision. In addition, individual members of the
SpeechWorks board of directors may have given different weight to different
factors. The list of factors described in this section as having been considered
by the SpeechWorks board of directors is not intended to be the complete list of
all factors considered but is believed to include all of the factors considered
by the SpeechWorks board of directors to be material.

     After considering all of the information and factors described in this
section, the SpeechWorks board of directors unanimously approved the merger, the
merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. The SpeechWorks board of directors believes that the merger agreement
and the merger are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of SpeechWorks
and its stockholders. The SpeechWorks board of directors has unanimously
recommended that the SpeechWorks stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger.

  OPINION OF SPEECHWORKS FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Pursuant to a letter dated October 15, 2002, Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated was engaged to provide financial advisory services, including a
financial opinion letter in connection with the merger. Morgan Stanley was
selected by the SpeechWorks board of directors to act as SpeechWorks' financial
advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and
its knowledge of the business and affairs of SpeechWorks and the market in which
it competes.

     At the April 23, 2003 meeting of the SpeechWorks board of directors, Morgan
Stanley rendered its oral opinion that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to holders of the SpeechWorks common stock. Morgan Stanley confirmed its opinion
in writing by delivery to the SpeechWorks board of directors of a written
opinion dated April 23, 2003.

     The full text of the Morgan Stanley opinion, dated April 23, 2003, which
sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The Morgan Stanley opinion is
directed to the SpeechWorks board of directors and addresses only the fairness
of the exchange ratio from a financial point of view to holders of the
SpeechWorks common stock as of the date of such opinion and does not address any
other aspect of the merger. The summary of the Morgan Stanley opinion set forth
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the Morgan Stanley opinion attached as Annex C
hereto, which should be read carefully and in its entirety.

     In arriving at the Morgan Stanley opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       information of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, respectively;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data concerning SpeechWorks and ScanSoft prepared by the
       management of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, respectively;

     - reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of
       SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, respectively;

     - discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the
       prospects of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, including information relating to
       certain strategic, financial, and operational benefits anticipated from
       the merger, with senior executives of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft,
       respectively;

     - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the SpeechWorks
       common stock and the ScanSoft common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft and the
       prices and trading activity of the common stock with that of certain
       other comparable publicly-traded companies and their securities;

     - reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on ScanSoft's earnings per
       share;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable acquisition transactions;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       SpeechWorks and ScanSoft and their financial and legal advisors;

     - reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; and

     - considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at the Morgan Stanley opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and
relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of
the information reviewed by it for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to
the financial projections, including information relating to certain strategic,
financial, and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley
assumed that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance
of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment by the managements of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft of
SpeechWorks' and ScanSoft's technologies, products, and intellectual property,
the timing and risks associated with the integration of SpeechWorks with
ScanSoft and the validity of, and risks associated with SpeechWorks' and
ScanSoft's existing and future technologies, products, and intellectual
property.

     In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among
other things, that the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization,
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Morgan Stanley did
not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
SpeechWorks, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. The Morgan Stanley
opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the
date of its opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit,
and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to an acquisition,
business combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving SpeechWorks.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the opinion letter.
Certain of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented
in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by
Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary.
The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses.

     Historical Common Stock Performance.  Morgan Stanley's analysis of
SpeechWorks' common stock performance consisted of a review of closing prices
and trading volumes during the period from October 22, 2002 to April 22, 2003.
During that period, based on closing prices as reported on the NASDAQ National
Market, SpeechWorks common stock achieved a high closing price per share of
$3.86 on December 2, 2002 and a low closing price per share of $2.05 on February
5, 2003. Additionally, Morgan Stanley noted that SpeechWorks common stock closed
at a price of $2.61 per share on April 22, 2003.

     Morgan Stanley's analysis of ScanSoft's common stock performance consisted
of a review of closing prices and trading volumes during the period from October
22, 2002 to April 22, 2003. During that period, based on closing prices as
reported on the NASDAQ National Market, ScanSoft common stock achieved a high
closing price per share of $7.50 on November 27, 2002 and a low closing price
per share of $3.95 on February 12, 2003. Additionally, Morgan Stanley noted that
ScanSoft common stock closed at a price of $5.50 per share on April 22, 2003.

     Based on the closing stock prices of SpeechWorks common stock and ScanSoft
common stock as of April 22, 2003, and the exchange ratio, the implied
consideration for the SpeechWorks common stock was approximately $4.73 per
share.

     Comparative Stock Price Performance.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the closing
prices of SpeechWorks common stock, ScanSoft common stock, the NASDAQ index and
the common stock of a comparable speech company, Nuance Communications Inc.,
during the period from October 22, 2002 to April 22, 2003. Morgan Stanley
observed that, during the period from October 22, 2002 to April 22, 2003,
SpeechWorks' common stock increased 17.6%, ScanSoft's common stock increased
29.7%, the NASDAQ index increased 12.3%, and Nuance's common stock increased
30.0%.

     Comparable Public Company Analysis.  As part of its analysis, Morgan
Stanley compared selected publicly available financial information of selected
digital imaging and speech software companies as listed below. Morgan Stanley
also compared composites (the "comparable composites") of selected publicly
available information of selected application software companies ("application
vendors") and selected system management companies ("system management vendors")
with ScanSoft and SpeechWorks, digital imaging and speech software companies.
Morgan Stanley did not include Nuance in any of these groups

due to the fact that its aggregate value and EPS estimates were negative at the
time, rendering the multiples not meaningful.

                COMPARABLE DIGITAL IMAGING AND SPEECH SOFTWARE COMPANIES
                --------------------------------------------------------

- -    Adobe Systems Inc.                      -    ScanSoft
- -    Brooktrout Inc.                         -    SpeechWorks

- -    Macromedia Inc.

     While noting that none of the comparable public companies listed above are
identical to SpeechWorks or ScanSoft, Morgan Stanley compared the publicly
available financial information of those companies to the financial performance
of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft. Such information included the stock trading price
divided by the 2003 and 2004 estimated earnings per share ("EPS") adjusted for a
calendar year end (the "2003 price/estimated earnings multiple" and the "2004
price/estimated earnings multiple") and the aggregate value divided by 2003 and
2004 estimated revenue (the "aggregate value/ 2003 estimated revenue multiple"
and the "aggregate value/2004 estimated revenue multiple"). The estimated EPS
and estimated revenue were derived from I/B/E/S International mean EPS
estimates, with the exception of the 2003 estimated EPS and estimated revenue
for SpeechWorks and ScanSoft (the "Street Case"), which were obtained from
selected publicly available equity research for each company. The SpeechWorks
Street Case was based on C.E. Unterberg Towbin equity research published January
30, 2003. The ScanSoft Street Case was based on Needham equity research
published February 25, 2003. I/B/E/S is a database owned and operated by Thomson
Financial, which contains estimated and actual earnings, cash flows, dividends,
sales, and pre-tax income data for companies in the United States, Europe, Asia
and emerging markets.

     The ScanSoft 2003 estimated EPS and 2004 estimated EPS were derived using a
10% and 15% effective tax rate, respectively. These tax rates were derived from
the equity research used in developing the Street Case for ScanSoft and are
primarily the result of the expected effect of ScanSoft's net operating losses
on net income in 2003. Morgan Stanley also compared the ScanSoft 2003
price/estimated earnings multiple and 2004 price/estimated earnings multiple
using EPS estimates derived using a 35% effective tax rate (the "adjusted 2003
price/estimated earnings multiple" and "adjusted 2004 price/estimated earnings
multiple".)

     The following table presents, as of April 22, 2003, the 2003 aggregate
value/estimated revenue multiples and the 2003 price/estimated earnings
multiples for the comparable companies and composites:

     Morgan Stanley noted that the ScanSoft trading multiples and the
SpeechWorks trading multiples implied by the exchange ratio were in line with
trading multiples of comparable public companies within the digital imaging and
speech software sector.

     No company utilized in the comparable company comparison analysis is
identical to SpeechWorks or ScanSoft. In evaluating the peer group, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of SpeechWorks or ScanSoft. These other
matters include the impact of competition on the business of SpeechWorks or
ScanSoft and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of SpeechWorks
or ScanSoft or in the industry or financial markets in general. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using peer group data.

     Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratios of the closing
prices of the SpeechWorks common stock divided by the corresponding prices of
ScanSoft common stock over various periods during the period from October 22,
2002 to April 22, 2003. Morgan Stanley observed the following implied exchange
ratios and implied equity value premiums over various periods ending on April
22, 2003 and as of April 22, 2003:

                                                     AVERAGE IMPLIED

As of April 22, 2003...............................       0.47x                  81%

     Morgan Stanley noted that during the prior six month period for which it
conducted its analysis, the average exchange ratio between SpeechWorks and
ScanSoft was 0.50, which was lower than the 0.860 merger exchange ratio to be
paid by ScanSoft pursuant to the merger agreement.

     Pro Forma Contribution Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma
financial contribution of each of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks to the combined
company based on, among other things, a street case derived from publicly
available equity research. Morgan Stanley did not use contribution from net
income because SpeechWorks' 2003 estimated net income is not positive. The
following table presents the relative pro forma equity ownership implied by
SpeechWorks' and ScanSoft's relative revenue and gross margins contribution,
adjusted for each company's net cash contribution:

                                                    SPEECHWORKS            SCANSOFT

Calendar Year 2003
Estimated Gross Margin
  Street Case..................................  29.3      26.8%      117.0      73.2%

     The implied offer prices in the above table did not take into account any
estimates by the managements of SpeechWorks or ScanSoft of the synergies or cost
savings anticipated from the merger, nor did they take into account any
accounting adjustments or potential changes in capital structure as a result of
the merger. Morgan Stanley noted that the SpeechWorks ownership split of the
combined entity of 29% implied by the 0.860 merger exchange ratio was consistent
with the relative financial contributions of SpeechWorks to the combined entity.

     Analysis of Precedent Transactions.  Morgan Stanley compared selected
publicly available statistics for up to 55 public software stock-for-stock
transactions valued at less than $1 billion at announcement from January 1, 1998
to April 22, 2003. The following table presents the indicated premiums paid
above the exchange ratio determined by the closing share prices one day before
the announcement of the respective transaction and the premiums to the average
exchange ratio 30 days, 60 days and 90 days before the announcement of the
respective transaction:

                                                      EXCHANGE RATIO PREMIUM

Median..........................      25.2%          36.0%            41.4%            37.0%

Minimum.........................     (15.6%)        (26.6%)          (16.3%)          (11.1%)

     Morgan Stanley noted that the exchange ratio premiums implied for
SpeechWorks of 62% and 63%, for the 30-day and 60-day averages, respectively,
were above the mean and median exchange ratio premium paid for the transactions
represented in the table above. No transaction utilized as a comparison in the
precedent transactions analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the
precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions regarding
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of ScanSoft
or SpeechWorks, such as the impact of competition on SpeechWorks or ScanSoft and
the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse
change in the financial condition and prospects of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks or
the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis such
as determining the average or median is not in itself a meaningful method of
using comparable transaction data.

     Discounted Equity Value Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the value per
share of SpeechWorks by calculating the SpeechWorks stock price in 2005 by
estimating its 2006 revenues, applying an aggregate value/revenue ratio, adding
net cash, dividing by the fully-diluted number of shares and discounting that
figure to March 2003. Morgan Stanley also calculated the SpeechWorks stock price
in 2003 by estimating its 2004 revenues, applying an aggregate value/revenue
ratio, adding net cash, dividing by the fully-diluted number of shares and
discounting that figure to March 2003. Morgan Stanley used a revenue growth rate
of 12.5% to 22.5%, a discount rate of 13%, net cash of $32.5 million and an
aggregate value/revenue ratio range of 0.3x to 1.1x.

     The following table presents the high and low of the discounted SpeechWorks
stock price based on various revenue growth rates and aggregate value/revenue
ratios:

High..........................................   $2.55             $2.66

     Morgan Stanley analyzed the value per share of ScanSoft by calculating
ScanSoft's stock price in 2005 by estimating its 2006 earnings per share,
applying a price to earnings ratio and discounting that figure to March 2003.
Morgan Stanley estimated the 2006 EPS by applying a growth rate to 2002 revenues
to derive 2006 revenues, multiplying by an operating margin, subtracting tax
expense, and dividing by the fully-diluted number of shares. Morgan Stanley also
calculated ScanSoft's stock price in 2003 by estimating its 2004 earnings per
share, applying a price to earnings ratio and discounting that figure to March
2003. Morgan Stanley estimated the 2003 EPS by applying a growth rate to 2002
revenues to derive 2004 revenues, multiplying by an operating margin,
subtracting tax expense, and dividing by the fully-diluted number of shares.
ScanSoft 2002 revenues were pro forma for a full year of results from the
businesses acquired from Philips and Lernout & Hauspie. Morgan Stanley used a
discount rate of 13%, a price to earnings ratio of 20x, a tax rate of 35%, an
operating margin range of 17.5% to 25.0% and a revenue growth rate of 10.0% to
20.0%.

     The following table presents the high and low of the discounted ScanSoft
stock price based on various revenue growth rates and price to earnings ratios:

     Morgan Stanley analyzed the value per share of ScanSoft pro forma for the
transaction on a SpeechWorks per share basis. Morgan Stanley calculated the
ScanSoft stock price in 2005 by estimating the 2006 earnings per share, applying
a price to earnings ratio and discounting that figure to March 2003. Morgan
Stanley estimated the 2006 EPS by applying a growth rate to 2002 revenues to
derive 2006 revenues, multiplying by an operating margin, subtracting tax
expense, dividing by the fully-diluted number of shares and multiplying by the
exchange ratio of 0.860. Morgan Stanley calculated the ScanSoft stock price in
2003 by estimating the 2004 earnings per share, applying a price to earnings
ratio and discounting that figure to March 2003. Morgan Stanley estimated the
2003 EPS by applying a growth rate to 2002 revenues to derive 2004 revenues,
multiplying by an operating margin, subtracting tax expense, dividing by the
fully-diluted number of shares and multiplying by the exchange ratio of 0.860.
2002 revenues were derived by combining the SpeechWorks 2002 revenues and the
ScanSoft 2002 revenues, pro forma for a full year of results from the businesses
acquired from Philips and Lernout & Hauspie. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate
of 13%, a price to earnings ratio of 20x, a tax rate of 35%, an operating margin
range of 17.5% to 25.0% and a revenue growth rate of 10.5% to 20.5%.

     The following table presents the high and low of the discounted ScanSoft
stock price pro forma for the transaction, on a per SpeechWorks share basis,
based on various revenue growth rates and price to earnings ratios:

     Pro Forma Analysis of the Merger.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma
impact of the merger on estimated EPS for ScanSoft for the calendar year 2003.
The pro forma results were calculated as if the merger had closed at the
beginning of ScanSoft's calendar 2003 first quarter and were based on publicly
available equity research and earnings estimates and other information provided
in discussions with management of both companies.

     The results of Morgan Stanley's pro forma analyses indicated that the
merger would be dilutive to ScanSoft's 2003 estimated EPS by between $.20 and
$.22. Morgan Stanley estimated that pre-tax synergies on an earnings (excluding
amortization and extraordinary items) basis, of between $24.6 million and $26.7
million would be required in order for the merger not to be dilutive to
ScanSoft's earnings per share in calendar year 2003.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its
analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any
particular analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley
believes that selecting any portion of Morgan Stanley's analyses, without
considering all its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying the Morgan Stanley opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that
the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of
SpeechWorks or ScanSoft.

     In performing its analysis, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of SpeechWorks or ScanSoft.
Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Morgan Stanley are not
necessarily indicative of actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were prepared
solely as a part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement and were
provided to the SpeechWorks board of directors in connection with the delivery
of the Morgan Stanley opinion to SpeechWorks. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals of value or to reflect the prices at which SpeechWorks or ScanSoft
might actually be sold. In addition, as described above, the Morgan Stanley
opinion was one of the many factors taken into consideration by the SpeechWorks
board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. The
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through
arm's-length negotiations between SpeechWorks and ScanSoft and was approved by
the SpeechWorks board of directors. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
SpeechWorks board of directors with respect to the value of SpeechWorks or of
whether the SpeechWorks board of directors would have been willing to agree to
different consideration.

     Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking business, is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate,

estate and other purposes. Morgan Stanley may continue to provide investment
banking services to the combined entity in the future. In the ordinary course of
its trading, brokerage, investment management and financing activities, Morgan
Stanley and its affiliates may, at any time, have a long or short position in,
and buy and sell the debt or equity securities and senior loans of SpeechWorks
or ScanSoft for its account or the account of its customers.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of October 15, 2002, Morgan
Stanley provided financial advisory services and a financial fairness opinion in
connection with the merger, and SpeechWorks agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee
based on a percentage of the aggregate consideration to be received by
SpeechWorks stockholders at the closing of the merger, subject to Morgan Stanley
receiving a minimum fee of $2.0 million. Assuming that the merger closed on June
10, 2003, Morgan Stanley would be entitled to a fee of approximately $2.6
million. SpeechWorks also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for expenses
incurred by Morgan Stanley in performing its services. In addition, SpeechWorks
has also agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or
arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     When ScanSoft and SpeechWorks stockholders consider the recommendation of
the boards of directors of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks with respect to the merger,
they should be aware that some of the executive officers and directors of
ScanSoft and SpeechWorks have interests in connection with the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of their respective
stockholders, as summarized below. In making their decision to recommend the
merger, the boards of directors of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks were aware of these
interests and considered them among the other matters described above under the
sections entitled "The Merger -- Consideration of the Merger by
ScanSoft -- ScanSoft's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the ScanSoft
Board of Directors" on page [     ] and "The Merger -- Consideration of the
Merger by SpeechWorks -- SpeechWorks' Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation
of the SpeechWorks Board of Directors" on page [     ].

  INTERESTS OF SCANSOFT DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     Ms. Katharine Martin, one of ScanSoft's directors, and the owner of record
of 1,000 shares of ScanSoft common stock and options to purchase an aggregate of
100,000 shares of ScanSoft common stock, is a member of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich
& Rosati, the law firm representing ScanSoft in connection with the merger.

     As a result of this interest, Ms. Martin could be more likely to vote to
approve the issuance of shares of ScanSoft common stock in the merger than if
she did not hold this interest, and may have reasons for doing so that are not
the same as your interests. ScanSoft stockholders should consider whether this
interest may have influenced Ms. Martin to support or recommend the merger.

  INTERESTS OF SPEECHWORKS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     Executive Officer and Directors.  Mr. Stuart R. Patterson, Chief Executive
Officer of SpeechWorks, will be appointed as President of the combined company
following the effective time of the merger. In addition, Mr. Patterson, and two
other directors of SpeechWorks reasonably acceptable to ScanSoft, will remain on
the board of directors of the combined company.

     Employment.  In connection with the merger, Mr. Patterson entered into an
employment agreement with ScanSoft, whereby Mr. Patterson has been provided with
certain incentives to serve as President of the combined company following the
merger. In addition, SpeechWorks is party to an employment agreement with Mr.
Richard J. Westelman, Chief Financial Officer of SpeechWorks, dated June 21,
2000. Under that agreement, Mr. Westelman is entitled to certain remuneration
if, among other things, he voluntarily terminates his employment or his
employment is terminated without cause by SpeechWorks,

including as the surviving corporation in the merger. See the section entitled
"Agreements Related to the Merger -- Employment Agreements" beginning on page
[     ] for a description of these agreements.

     Acceleration of Stock Options.  In order to eliminate the ongoing
compensation expense and limit the number of outstanding options that would
result from SpeechWorks options remaining outstanding as ScanSoft options after
the merger, ScanSoft has required that all SpeechWorks options be accelerated
and, to the extent not exercised, terminated prior to the closing of the merger.
Accordingly, under the terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding options to
purchase shares of SpeechWorks common stock held by SpeechWorks employees,
officers and directors will fully vest prior to the effective time of the
merger. The vesting of all options held by non-officer employees will accelerate
as of the second business day following the initial filing with the SEC of the
registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part.
The vesting of options held by officers and directors will be subsequently
accelerated, prior to the effective time of the merger, on a date to be
determined by the SpeechWorks board of directors. As of May 28, 2003, officers
and directors of SpeechWorks owned options to purchase an aggregate of 1,637,131
shares of SpeechWorks common stock, of which 513,032 were then unvested, and all
other employees (current and former) held options to purchase an aggregate of
3,451,222 shares of SpeechWorks common stock, of which 1,811,155 were then
unvested, all with an exercise price less than $4.95. Any option not exercised
prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled. As of May 28, 2003,
the closing price of a share of SpeechWorks common stock, as reported on the
NASDAQ National Market, was $4.95. The following table sets forth, as of May 28,
2003, the number of unvested and vested options with exercise prices below and
above $4.95 per share, all of which will accelerate, owned by each SpeechWorks
officer and director.

     SpeechWorks cannot determine the number of options that SpeechWorks
employees, officers and directors will exercise and, with respect to the shares
of SpeechWorks common stock issued upon exercise, sell prior to the effective
time of the merger. SpeechWorks expects, however, that all optionholders will
exercise their in-the-money options prior to the closing of the merger and that
many optionholders, including SpeechWorks executive officers and directors, will
elect to sell at least the portion of the shares issued upon exercise as is
necessary to recoup the exercise price and pay any tax liabilities which the
optionholder incurs in connection with the option exercise. In addition,
executive officers and directors and other employees may for personal reasons,
including to diversify their investment holdings, elect to sell some or all of
the remaining shares acquired upon exercise of options prior to the closing of
the merger. In

order to decrease the number of shares of SpeechWorks common stock that are
expected to be sold in the market in connection with the acceleration of options
and, as described below, shares of restricted common stock, SpeechWorks officers
and directors will be permitted to pay the exercise price of certain of their
options and/or satisfy any withholding taxes resulting from such exercise or
from the vesting of their restricted stock by surrendering to SpeechWorks that
number of shares of SpeechWorks common stock that the respective officer or
director would otherwise be entitled to under his respective option or
restricted stock award grant, as the case may be. Consequently, up to an
aggregate of approximately 352,000 shares of SpeechWorks common stock that may
otherwise have been sold in the market to satisfy such exercise price or tax
withholding obligations may be surrendered to SpeechWorks by officers and
directors.

     As discussed below and in the section entitled "Agreements Related to the
Merger - SpeechWorks Voting Agreements," SpeechWorks directors and officers have
entered into voting agreements with ScanSoft. These voting agreements permit the
sale of vested restricted common stock, as well as shares of SpeechWorks common
stock issued after the date of the initial filing date of the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part with the SEC
and pursuant to the exercise of SpeechWorks stock options. Such agreements also
permit the sale of all shares of common stock held by William O'Farrell and up
to 200,000 shares held by Michael Phillips.

     Acceleration of Restricted Stock Awards.  In March 2003, as part of its
annual equity incentive program, SpeechWorks granted an aggregate of 650,192
shares of restricted common stock to certain SpeechWorks employees, including
the officers named below. These awards vest on March 26, 2007, provided that
they will vest as to 50% of the then unvested shares upon an acquisition. The
merger will constitute an acquisition for these purposes. As discussed above,
officers and directors will be permitted to satisfy any withholding taxes due in
connection with such acceleration by surrendering to SpeechWorks shares of
SpeechWorks common stock. In addition to the acceleration in connection with the
merger, if, within one year of the effective date of the closing, the
individual's employment is terminated without cause or for good reason, as
defined in the restricted stock agreement evidencing such grants, 100% of any
then unvested shares would vest. In addition, the award would fully vest upon
the recipient's death or disability. As of May 28, 2003, no such shares of
restricted common stock had vested. The following table sets forth the aggregate
number of shares of restricted common stock beneficially owned by each
SpeechWorks executive officer.

     Indemnification.  ScanSoft and SpeechWorks directors and officers have
customary rights to indemnification against losses incurred as a result of
actions or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. The
merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years after the completion
of the merger, ScanSoft shall, and will cause SpeechWorks (as a wholly owned
subsidiary) to, fulfill all obligations of SpeechWorks to indemnify SpeechWorks
directors and officers under the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
SpeechWorks, and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving
corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation, advancement of
expenses and indemnification that are at least as favorable to SpeechWorks
directors and officers as those contained in

the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of SpeechWorks prior to the
effective time of the merger. In addition, for a period of three years after the
effective time of the merger, ScanSoft will also cause SpeechWorks to maintain
$10 million of directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover any such
liabilities.

     Voting Agreements.  SpeechWorks directors and officers have entered into
voting agreements with ScanSoft in connection with the merger. See the section
entitled "Agreements Related to the Merger -- SpeechWorks Voting Agreements"
beginning on page [     ] for a description of these agreements.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF SCANSOFT FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     ScanSoft currently intends to make changes to the ScanSoft board of
directors following completion of the merger such that the ScanSoft board of
directors will be comprised of eight directors, and shall include three
directors designated by SpeechWorks, who shall initially be Mr. Stuart R.
Patterson and two other directors of SpeechWorks reasonably acceptable to
ScanSoft.

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following summary discusses the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger to stockholders of SpeechWorks. The following
discussion is based on existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
existing Treasury Regulations, and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change and to differing interpretations,
possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion assumes that stockholders of
SpeechWorks hold their shares of SpeechWorks common stock as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally,
property held as an investment).

     We do not discuss all United States federal income tax considerations that
may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of such stockholder's
particular circumstances, or to stockholders subject to special treatment under
the federal income tax laws, including:

     - dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

     - stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
       the Internal Revenue Code;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - non-United States persons or entities;

     - financial institutions or insurance companies;

     - stockholders who acquired SpeechWorks common stock in connection with
       stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory
       transactions; or

     - stockholders who hold SpeechWorks common stock as part of an integrated
       investment, including a "straddle," comprised of shares of SpeechWorks
       common stock and one or more other positions.

     In addition, we do not discuss the tax consequences of the merger under
foreign, state or local tax law.

     ACCORDINGLY, WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

     Based on factual representations contained in letters provided by ScanSoft
and SpeechWorks, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must
continue to be true and accurate as of the closing date of the merger, each of,
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel to ScanSoft,
and Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to SpeechWorks, has delivered its opinion
(attached as exhibits 8.1 and 8.2, respectively, to the registration statement,
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part) that the merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" for United States federal

income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The following material United States federal income tax consequences will
result from such qualification:

     - a SpeechWorks stockholder will not recognize any gain or loss upon the
       receipt of ScanSoft common stock solely in exchange for SpeechWorks
       common stock pursuant to the merger, except for cash received instead of
       a fractional share of ScanSoft common stock;

     - the aggregate tax basis of the ScanSoft common stock received by a
       SpeechWorks stockholder in the merger, including any fractional share of
       ScanSoft common stock not actually received, will be equal to the
       aggregate tax basis of the SpeechWorks common stock surrendered in
       exchange for ScanSoft common stock pursuant to the merger;

     - the holding period of the ScanSoft common stock received by a SpeechWorks
       stockholder in the merger will include the holding period of the
       SpeechWorks common stock surrendered in exchange therefor in the merger;

     - a cash payment received by a SpeechWorks stockholder instead of a
       fractional share of ScanSoft common stock will be treated as if such
       fractional share had been issued pursuant to the merger and then redeemed
       by ScanSoft, and the SpeechWorks stockholder will recognize capital gain
       or loss with respect to such cash payment, measured by the difference, if
       any, between the amount of cash received and the tax basis in such
       fractional share. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or
       loss if the SpeechWorks common stock in respect of which such cash
       payment is received has been held for more than one year at the closing
       date of the merger; and

     - ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation and SpeechWorks will not
       recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger.

     The completion of the merger is conditioned upon the delivery of an opinion
by each of, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel
to ScanSoft, and Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to SpeechWorks, that the merger will
constitute a reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions will
be based on updated representation letters to be provided by ScanSoft and
SpeechWorks at the closing date of the merger, and on customary factual
assumptions. Although the merger agreement allows ScanSoft and SpeechWorks to
waive this condition to the completion of the merger, neither ScanSoft nor
SpeechWorks currently anticipates doing so. If either ScanSoft or SpeechWorks
does waive this condition, stockholders of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks will be
informed of this decision and asked to vote in connection with the merger,
taking this waiver into consideration.

     Neither ScanSoft nor SpeechWorks will request a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service regarding the tax consequences of the merger. The tax opinions
do not bind the Internal Revenue Service and do not prevent the Internal Revenue
Service from successfully asserting a contrary position. In addition, if any of
the representations or assumptions upon which the opinions are based is
inconsistent with the actual facts, such opinions by their terms no longer
apply, and the tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected.

     A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization
status of the merger would result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss by
a SpeechWorks stockholder with respect to each share of SpeechWorks common stock
exchanged in the merger equal to the difference between such stockholder's basis
in such share and the sum of the fair market value, as of the closing date of
the merger, of the ScanSoft common stock received in the exchange and any cash
received instead of a fractional share. In such event, the stockholder's
aggregate tax basis in the ScanSoft common stock so received would equal its
fair market value as of the closing date of the merger, and the stockholder's
holding period for such stock would begin the day after the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     ScanSoft will account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, "Business Combinations." As such, the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed of SpeechWorks will be recorded at their fair values as of the date of
the merger. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired will be recorded as
goodwill. The results of operations of SpeechWorks will be included in
ScanSoft's results of operations from the date of the closing of the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
the merger may not be consummated unless certain filings have been submitted to
the FTC and the Antitrust Division and certain waiting period requirements have
been satisfied. ScanSoft and SpeechWorks filed the appropriate notification and
report forms with the FTC and with the Antitrust Division and notice of the
early termination of the waiting period was received on June 5, 2003.

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions like the merger. At any time before or after
the completion of the merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take any
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
the divestiture of substantial assets of ScanSoft or SpeechWorks. In addition,
certain private parties, as well as state attorneys general and other antitrust
authorities, may challenge the transaction under antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.

     In addition, the merger may be subject to various foreign antitrust laws.

     ScanSoft and SpeechWorks believe that the completion of the merger will not
violate any antitrust laws. There can be no assurance, however, that a challenge
to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is
made, what the result will be.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF SCANSOFT SHARES ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE
MERGER

     ScanSoft will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares
of ScanSoft common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be
authorized for listing on the NASDAQ National Market before the completion of
the merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF SPEECHWORKS COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, SpeechWorks common stock will be delisted

                        AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. You should read the merger agreement in its
entirety, as it is the legal document governing this merger, and the provisions
of the merger agreement are not easily summarized.

  STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     Spiderman Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ScanSoft,
will merge with and into SpeechWorks, and, as a result, SpeechWorks will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of ScanSoft.

  EFFECTIVE TIME AND TIMING OF CLOSING

     The merger will be completed and become effective when the certificate of
merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time as we may agree and as is specified in the certificate of merger, in
accordance with Delaware law. The closing of the merger will take place no later
than the fifth business day after all conditions to the merger have been
satisfied or waived, or on such other date as we may agree. We currently
anticipate that we will complete the merger four business days after the
ScanSoft and SpeechWorks special meetings, assuming ScanSoft's and SpeechWorks
stockholders give their requisite approvals and all conditions to the merger
have been satisfied or waived.

  MERGER CONSIDERATION

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of SpeechWorks common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive
0.860 of a share of ScanSoft common stock upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of SpeechWorks common stock in the manner provided in
the merger agreement. Upon completion of the merger, ScanSoft also will assume
all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of SpeechWorks common stock in
accordance with the terms of each such warrant.

     The exchange ratio in the merger will be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into ScanSoft common stock or
SpeechWorks common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to ScanSoft common stock or SpeechWorks common
stock having a record date on or after the date of the merger agreement and
prior to completion of the merger.

     Based on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of SpeechWorks common
stock outstanding as of           , 2003, and assuming the exercise of
approximately [          ] outstanding options to purchase shares of SpeechWorks
common stock, a total of approximately [          ] shares of ScanSoft common
stock will be issued in connection with the merger to holders of shares of
SpeechWorks common stock.

  FRACTIONAL SHARES

     ScanSoft will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection
with the merger. Instead, each holder of SpeechWorks common stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of ScanSoft common stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of ScanSoft common stock that would
otherwise be received by such SpeechWorks stockholder) will be entitled to
receive cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the fractional shares
multiplied by the average closing price of one share of ScanSoft common stock
for the ten most recent trading days that ScanSoft common stock has traded,
ending on the trading day one day prior to the date the merger is completed, as
reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.

  EXCHANGE OF SPEECHWORKS STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR SCANSOFT STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Promptly following completion of the merger, U.S. Stock Transfer
Corporation, the exchange agent for the merger, will mail to each record holder
of SpeechWorks common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering the record holder's SpeechWorks stock certificates in exchange for
certificates representing whole shares of ScanSoft common stock, and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares. Only those holders of SpeechWorks common stock
who properly surrender their SpeechWorks stock certificates in accordance with
the exchange agent's instructions will receive:

     - certificates representing the number of whole shares of ScanSoft common
       stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the merger agreement;

     - cash in lieu of any fractional share of ScanSoft common stock; and

     - dividends or other distributions, if any, to which they are entitled
       under the terms of the merger agreement.

     The surrendered certificates representing SpeechWorks common stock will be
canceled. After the effective time of the merger, each certificate representing
shares of SpeechWorks common stock that has not been surrendered will represent
only the right to receive each of the items, as the case may be, enumerated
above. Following the completion of the merger, SpeechWorks will not register any
transfers of SpeechWorks common stock on its stock transfer books. Holders of
SpeechWorks common stock should not send in their SpeechWorks stock certificates
until they receive a letter of transmittal from U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation,
the exchange agent for the merger, with instructions for the surrender of
SpeechWorks stock certificates.

  DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES

     Holders of SpeechWorks common stock are not entitled to receive any
dividends or other distributions on ScanSoft common stock until the merger is
completed. After the merger is completed, holders of SpeechWorks common stock
certificates will be entitled to dividends and other distributions declared or
made after completion of the merger with respect to the number of whole shares
of ScanSoft common stock which they are entitled to receive upon exchange of
their SpeechWorks stock certificates, but they will not be paid any dividends or
other distributions on the ScanSoft common stock until they surrender their
SpeechWorks stock certificates to the exchange agent in accordance with the
exchange agent instructions.

  TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP AND LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES

     ScanSoft will issue only (1) certificates representing the number of whole
shares of ScanSoft common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the
merger agreement, (2) cash in lieu of any fractional share of ScanSoft common
stock, and (3) any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which they are
entitled under the terms of the merger agreement, in a name other than the name
in which a surrendered SpeechWorks stock certificate is registered if the person
requesting such exchange presents to the exchange agent all documents required
to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and to show that such
person paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If a SpeechWorks stock
certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such certificate may
need to deliver a bond prior to receiving any ScanSoft common stock certificate.

  TREATMENT OF SPEECHWORKS STOCK OPTIONS

     In order to eliminate the ongoing compensation expense and limit the number
of outstanding options that would result from SpeechWorks options remaining
outstanding as ScanSoft options after the merger, ScanSoft has required that all
SpeechWorks options be accelerated and, to the extent not exercised, terminated
prior to the closing of the merger. Accordingly, under the terms of the merger
agreement, all outstanding options to purchase shares of SpeechWorks common
stock held by SpeechWorks employees, officers and directors will fully vest, to
the extent that they do not vest sooner in accordance with their

normal vesting schedules, prior to the effective time of the merger. The vesting
of all options held by non-officer employees will accelerate as of the second
business day following the initial filing with the SEC of the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. The vesting
of options held by officers and directors will be subsequently accelerated,
prior to the effective time of the merger, on a date to be determined by the
SpeechWorks board of directors. SpeechWorks will take all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of SpeechWorks common
stock.

  TREATMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE SPEECHWORKS STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, the SpeechWorks' employee stock
purchase plan shall be terminated. Any offering period then underway under the
SpeechWorks' employee stock purchase plan shall be shortened, if necessary, and
pro rata adjustments to the rights of employees in the SpeechWorks' employee
stock purchase plan will be made to reflect the shortened offering period. Each
offering period will otherwise be treated as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes under the SpeechWorks employee stock purchase
plan.

merger. In addition, for a period of three years after the effective time of the
merger, ScanSoft will also cause SpeechWorks to maintain $10 million of
directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover any such liabilities.

  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     As soon as practicable after completion of the merger and in any event
within one year of the completion of the merger, ScanSoft shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the employees of SpeechWorks who are employed by
ScanSoft or one of its subsidiaries after the effective time of the merger with
similar types and levels of employee benefits as those provided to similarly
situated employees of ScanSoft. For purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits

where length of service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement (other
than a defined benefit plan) of ScanSoft and to the extent permitted by
applicable law, ScanSoft shall provide service credit under ScanSoft's benefit
plans or arrangements for their period of service with SpeechWorks prior to the
closing of the merger. ScanSoft may continue one or more of SpeechWorks' benefit
plans, provided the employee benefits provided would, in the aggregate, in the
reasonable judgment of ScanSoft, be no less favorable than those provided under
the SpeechWorks benefit plans.

  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF SCANSOFT FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     The ScanSoft board of directors agreed to take all actions necessary such
that, immediately following completion of the merger, the ScanSoft board of
directors will be comprised of eight directors, and shall include three
directors designated by SpeechWorks, who shall initially be Mr. Stuart R.
Patterson and two other directors of SpeechWorks reasonably acceptable to
ScanSoft.

  REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Each of ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation and SpeechWorks agreed

       other party an opportunity to review and comment on such filings or
       submissions;

     - promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments or requests
       for amendments or supplements to any filings or submissions made pursuant
       to, or information provided to comply with, any applicable laws,
       regulations and any other requirements of any governmental entity; and

     - promptly provide the other copies of any filing or submission made with

          the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories
          of assets that are material to ScanSoft, SpeechWorks or any of their
          respective subsidiaries;

        - the holding separate of SpeechWorks common stock; or

        - the imposition of any limitation on the ability of the respective
          company to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets or

  ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS

     SpeechWorks has agreed that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries, nor
any of the officers or directors of it or its subsidiaries shall and that it
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries
employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the
       making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal, as
       defined below;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
       any person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other
       action to knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiries or the
       making of any proposal that constitutes, or that may reasonably be
       expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;

     - engage in any discussions with any person with respect to any acquisition
       proposal, except as provided below;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal, except as
       provided below; or

     - enter into any agreement or commitment regarding any acquisition
       proposal.

     However, if SpeechWorks receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
acquisition proposal from a third party, then SpeechWorks may:

     - furnish nonpublic information with respect to SpeechWorks pursuant to a
       confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations and with terms
       at least as restrictive as the confidentiality agreement in place between
       ScanSoft and SpeechWorks, provided that SpeechWorks gives concurrent
       written notice to ScanSoft of its intention to furnish this information
       and provides ScanSoft with a complete list of the nonpublic information
       furnished to the third party; and

     - engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the
       acquisition proposal, provided that it gives ScanSoft concurrent written
       notice of its intention to enter into negotiations and keeps ScanSoft
       informed regarding all material developments with respect to the status
       of the negotiations;

     but only if:

     - the SpeechWorks board of directors has concluded in good faith, following
       consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required
       for it to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - the SpeechWorks board of directors has in good faith concluded, following
       consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
       that such acquisition proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in,
       a superior offer, as defined below.

     An "acquisition proposal" means any offer or proposal relating to any
transaction or series of related transactions, other than the merger, involving:

     - any purchase or acquisition by any person or group of more than a 15%
       interest in the total outstanding voting securities of SpeechWorks or any
       of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
       consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15%
       or more of the total outstanding voting securities of SpeechWorks or any
       of its subsidiaries;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving SpeechWorks or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
       exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
       business), acquisition or disposition of assets of SpeechWorks (including
       its subsidiaries taken as a whole) representing more than 15% of the
       aggregate fair market value of SpeechWorks' business immediately prior to
       such transaction; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan pertaining
       thereto) of SpeechWorks or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary
       dividend (whether in cash or other property).

     A "superior offer" means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, all or
substantially all of the assets of SpeechWorks or all of the outstanding voting
securities of SpeechWorks and as a result of which SpeechWorks stockholders
immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct
or indirect parent or subsidiary thereof. The terms of which offer the
SpeechWorks board of directors has in good faith concluded (following
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisers), taking
into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the offer and the person making the offer, to be more favorable to
SpeechWorks stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
the merger with ScanSoft and is reasonably capable of being consummated.

     SpeechWorks also has agreed to notify ScanSoft as promptly as practicable
after if it receives any acquisition proposal (as defined above), request for
nonpublic information or inquiry from a third party regarding the making of an
acquisition proposal or as to the manner in which such third party could proceed
with the making of an acquisition proposal, and to provide ScanSoft with oral
and written notice of the material terms and conditions of the proposal, request
or inquiry, the identity of the person or group making the proposal, request or
inquiry and a copy of such written proposal, request or inquiry. SpeechWorks has
further agreed to provide ScanSoft with oral and written notice as promptly as
practicable setting forth reasonable details of any material amendments or
proposed material amendments to the proposal, request or inquiry and to keep
ScanSoft informed, on a current basis, of all material developments with respect
to the status of any negotiations or related discussions in connection with such
acquisition proposal. In addition, SpeechWorks and its subsidiaries have agreed
to cease immediately all

existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties with
respect to any acquisition proposal.

  SPEECHWORKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDATIONS

     The merger agreement requires the SpeechWorks board of directors:

     - to recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the
       merger agreement and approval of the merger; and

     - not to withdraw, amend or modify, or to propose to withdraw amend or
       modify, its recommendation of the merger in a manner adverse to ScanSoft.

     However, in response to an acquisition proposal, the SpeechWorks board of
directors may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of
the merger and, in the case of a superior offer that is a tender or exchange
offer made directly to the stockholders of SpeechWorks, recommend that the
stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer, if:

     - the SpeechWorks board of directors determines in good faith that the
       acquisition proposal constitutes a superior offer and such acquisition
       proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn;

     - the SpeechWorks' special meeting of stockholders has not occurred;

     - SpeechWorks has delivered to ScanSoft a written notice at least three
       business days before effecting its change of recommendation, which notice
       states that SpeechWorks has received an acquisition proposal which it has
       determined is a superior offer, that the SpeechWorks board of directors
       intends to change its recommendation and the manner in which it intends
       to do so or may intend to do so; and

     - the SpeechWorks board of directors has complied with its non-solicitation
       obligations, provided the requisite notice of the acquisition proposal to
       ScanSoft and has complied with all specified requirements before
       furnishing any nonpublic information or engaging in negotiations with a
       third party, including concluding that such change in recommendation is
       required for it to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

     During the required three business day notice period, the SpeechWorks board
of directors shall provide ScanSoft the opportunity to make adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the merger, and shall give due consideration to these
alternative proposals.

     The merger agreement also permits SpeechWorks to comply with Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act in connection with any third party
acquisition proposal. In addition, the merger agreement does not prohibit the
SpeechWorks board of directors from fulfilling its duty of candor or disclosure
to SpeechWorks stockholders.

     The merger agreement requires SpeechWorks to submit the adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger to a stockholder vote even if the
SpeechWorks board of directors no longer recommends adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger.

  SCANSOFT BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDATIONS

     The merger agreement requires that the ScanSoft board of directors:

     - recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares
       of ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger; and

     - not withdraw, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw amend or modify,
       its recommendation that ScanSoft stockholders vote in favor of the stock
       issuance.

     However, the merger agreement does not prohibit the board of directors of
ScanSoft from fulfilling its duty of candor or disclosure to ScanSoft
stockholders.

  DEFINITION OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, a material adverse effect on
either ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation or SpeechWorks is defined to
mean any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect,
individually or when taken together, that is or is reasonably likely (i) to be
materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets),
capitalization, financial condition or results of operations of the respective
company taken as a whole with its subsidiaries or (ii) to materially impede the
authority of the respective company to complete the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable law.

     However, under the terms of the merger agreement, for purposes of clause
(i) above, none of the following, individually or in combination, will be deemed
to constitute, and none of the following will be taken into account in
determining, whether there has been or will be, a material adverse effect on
ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation or SpeechWorks, as the case may be:

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
       resulting from compliance with the terms and conditions of the merger
       agreement;

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
       resulting from the announcement or pendency of the merger, provided that
       this exception does not apply to any breach of a company's respective
       representations and warranties with respect to (1) intellectual property
       and (2) material contracts, which shall be considered for purposes of
       determining whether there has been a material adverse effect, even if
       such breaches result from the announcement or pendency of the merger;

     - any change in the stock price or trading volume, of ScanSoft or
       SpeechWorks, as the case may be;

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
       resulting from changes affecting any of the industries in which the
       respective company operates generally or the United States economy
       generally (which changes in each case do not disproportionately affect
       ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation or SpeechWorks, as the case
       may be, in any material respect); or

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
       resulting from changes affecting generally worldwide economic or capital
       market conditions (which changes in each case do not disproportionately
       affect ScanSoft, Spiderman Acquisition Corporation or SpeechWorks, as the
       case may be, in any material respect).

  TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms at any
time, except as set forth below, prior to completion of the merger, whether
before or after adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by
SpeechWorks stockholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of ScanSoft
common stock in connection with the merger by ScanSoft stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent of ScanSoft and SpeechWorks;

     - by ScanSoft or SpeechWorks if the merger is not completed by October 15,
       2003 (which will be extended by one day for each day the merger is
       delayed as a result of a pending acquisition of all or substantially all
       of the assets or all of the securities of ScanSoft as a result of which
       the stockholders of ScanSoft would own less than 50% of the surviving
       entity), except that this right to terminate the merger agreement is not
       available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
       principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on
       or before that date, and the action or failure to act constitutes a
       material breach of the merger agreement;

     - by ScanSoft or SpeechWorks, if there is any order of a court or other

       permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the completion of the

     - by ScanSoft or SpeechWorks if the proposal for the issuance of shares of
       ScanSoft common stock in connection with the merger fails to receive the
       requisite affirmative vote by ScanSoft stockholders at the ScanSoft
       special meeting or at any adjournment of that meeting, except that the
       right to terminate the merger agreement is not available to ScanSoft
       where the failure to obtain ScanSoft stockholder approval was caused by
       ScanSoft's action or failure to act and the action or failure to act
       constitutes a material breach by ScanSoft of the merger agreement;

     - by ScanSoft or SpeechWorks if the proposal for the adoption of the merger
       agreement and approval of the merger fails to receive the requisite
       affirmative vote at the SpeechWorks special meeting or at any adjournment
       of that meeting, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement
       is not available to SpeechWorks where the failure to obtain SpeechWorks
       stockholder approval was caused by SpeechWorks' action or failure to act,
       and the action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by
       SpeechWorks of the merger agreement;

     - by ScanSoft, at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement
       and the approval of the merger by the required vote of SpeechWorks
       stockholders, if any of the following "triggering events" occur with
       respect to SpeechWorks:

      - the SpeechWorks board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies, in a
        manner adverse to ScanSoft, its recommendation described in the section
        entitled "Agreements Related to the Merger -- The Merger
        Agreement -- SpeechWorks Board of Directors Recommendations" beginning
        on page [  ] of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;

      - the SpeechWorks board of directors fails to reaffirm (publicly, if
        ScanSoft requests) its recommendation that its stockholders vote in
        favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger
        within 10 business days after being requested in writing by ScanSoft to
        reaffirm such recommendation following public announcement of an
        acquisition proposal;

      - the SpeechWorks board of directors approves or recommends any
        acquisition proposal of the type described in the section entitled
        "Agreements Related to the Merger -- The Merger Agreement -- Alternative
        Transactions" beginning on page [  ] of this joint proxy statement/
        prospectus; or

      - a tender or exchange offer relating to SpeechWorks securities is
        initiated by a third party and SpeechWorks does not send to its
        securityholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
        Act within 10 business days after the tender or exchange offer is first
        published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that its board of
        directors recommends rejection of the tender or exchange offer;

     - by SpeechWorks upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement on the part of ScanSoft in the merger agreement or if any
       representation or warranty of ScanSoft has become untrue so that the
       condition to completion of the merger regarding ScanSoft's
       representations and warranties or covenants would not be met. However, if
       the breach or inaccuracy is curable by ScanSoft by the termination date
       of the merger agreement through the exercise of reasonable efforts, then
       SpeechWorks may not terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after
       receipt of written notice from SpeechWorks to ScanSoft of the breach, so
       long as ScanSoft continues to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
       cure the breach during this period. If the breach is cured during those
       30 days, or if SpeechWorks is otherwise in material breach of the merger
       agreement, SpeechWorks may not exercise this termination right;

     - by ScanSoft upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement on the part of SpeechWorks in the merger agreement or if any
       representation or warranty of SpeechWorks has become untrue so that the
       condition to completion of the merger regarding SpeechWorks'
       representations and warranties or covenants would not be met. However, if
       the breach or inaccuracy is curable by SpeechWorks by the termination
       date of the merger agreement through the exercise of reasonable efforts,
       then ScanSoft may not terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after
       receipt of written notice from ScanSoft to SpeechWorks of the breach, so
       long as SpeechWorks continues to use all commercially reasonable efforts
       to cure the breach during this period. If the breach is cured during
       those 30 days, or if ScanSoft is otherwise in material breach of the
       merger agreement, ScanSoft may not exercise this termination right;

     - by ScanSoft, if there is a material adverse effect on SpeechWorks since
       April 23, 2003; or

     - by SpeechWorks, if there is a material adverse effect on ScanSoft since
       April 23, 2003.

       exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, all
       or substantially all of the assets of ScanSoft or all of the outstanding
       voting securities of ScanSoft and as a result of which the stockholders

       50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
       transaction, or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof;

     - the merger agreement has been terminated because the ScanSoft

     - such acquisition is consummated within 12 months following termination of

     - the merger agreement has been terminated on either of the following
       bases:

      - the merger has not been completed by October 15, 2003 (or such later
        date representing an extension as a result of a pending acquisition of
        ScanSoft, as described above); or

      - SpeechWorks stockholders failed to adopt the merger agreement and
        approve the merger at the SpeechWorks special meeting or an adjournment
        of that meeting; and

     - either of the following has occurred:

      - within 12 months following termination of the merger agreement,
        SpeechWorks is the subject of an acquisition of the type described
        below; or

      - within 12 months following termination of the merger agreement,
        SpeechWorks enters into an agreement contemplating an acquisition of it
        in the type described below and, within 24 months

        following the termination of the merger agreement, an acquisition of the
        type described below is completed.

     In this case, the termination fee must be paid to ScanSoft within two
business days following the acquisition of SpeechWorks.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, an acquisition of SpeechWorks for
the purposes of these termination provisions, means any of the following:

     - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving SpeechWorks
       pursuant to which its stockholders immediately preceding such transaction
       hold less than 60% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or
       resulting entity of such transaction, or any direct or indirect parent
       thereof;

     - a sale or other disposition by SpeechWorks of assets representing in
       excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of its business,
       immediately prior to such sale; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or issuance by SpeechWorks, directly or
       indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
       ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of
       the then outstanding shares of SpeechWorks capital stock.

     In addition, SpeechWorks must pay a termination fee of $6.5 million to
ScanSoft if the merger agreement is terminated by ScanSoft as a result of the
occurrence of any of the conditions described above under the sixth bullet of
the section entitled "Agreements Related to the Merger -- The Merger
Agreement -- Termination of the Merger Agreement" with respect to SpeechWorks.
In this event, the termination fee must be paid to ScanSoft within two business
days following the termination by ScanSoft.

     Payment of a termination fee by ScanSoft or SpeechWorks is not in lieu of
damages incurred in the event of breach of the merger agreement. If the party
entitled to payment of the termination fee has to make a claim against the other
party to obtain such payment and such claim results in a judgment against the
other party, the party required to pay the termination fee will also have to pay
the other party's reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses, in connection with the suit together with interest on the
unpaid termination fee.

  COSTS AND EXPENSES

     In general, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the
merger is consummated, except that those expenses incurred in connection with
filing the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
is a part, including any amendments, printing and filing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and making required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or other similar foreign merger notification
laws will be shared equally by ScanSoft and SpeechWorks.

SCANSOFT VOTING AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of certain material provisions of the ScanSoft
voting agreements. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
form of voting agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex D to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference.

  AGREEMENT TO VOTE

     Each of Wayne Crandall, Robert Frankenberg, Katharine Martin, Jeanne
McCann, Mark Myers, Richard Palmer, Paul Ricci, Robert Teresi, Michael Tivnan,
Robert Weideman and Ben Wittner has entered into a voting agreement with
SpeechWorks. Each of these ScanSoft directors and executive officers has agreed
to vote his or her shares of ScanSoft common stock, and all options, warrants
and other rights to acquire shares of ScanSoft common stock, in favor of the
issuance of shares of ScanSoft common

stock in connection with the merger, against any proposal in competition with
the merger as contemplated by the merger agreement, against any action that
would delay or prevent the merger, against any proposal that would result in a
breach by ScanSoft of the merger agreement and against an election of a group of
individuals to replace a majority or more of the individuals on the board of
directors of ScanSoft. Each stockholder's obligation to vote in this manner
applies whether or not the ScanSoft board of directors continues to recommend
the merger to ScanSoft stockholders. These stockholders have the right, as of
the ScanSoft record date, to vote a total of [     ] shares of ScanSoft common
stock or approximately [     ]% of the outstanding shares of ScanSoft common
stock as of the ScanSoft record date.

     Each stockholder has also granted the directors on the board of directors
of SpeechWorks an irrevocable proxy to vote the shares of ScanSoft common stock
owned by such stockholder, including additional shares of ScanSoft common stock
subsequently acquired, as described above.

  TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

     The voting agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts or limits
the ability of each stockholder that is a party to the agreement to sell,
tender, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his or
her shares of ScanSoft common stock, or to agree to do the foregoing, other than
with SpeechWorks' prior written consent.

     Several exceptions to this restriction exist, such as (i) the authorization
for certain officers to sell shares of ScanSoft common stock pursuant to 10b5-1
plans currently in effect, and (ii) the authorization for Michael Tivnan to sell
up to 300,000 shares of ScanSoft common stock.

  TERMINATION

     The irrevocable proxy and voting agreement will terminate upon the earlier
to occur of:

     - the completion of the merger;

     - the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; or

     - the date as of which the stockholder's employment with ScanSoft has been
       terminated by ScanSoft.

SPEECHWORKS VOTING AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of certain material provisions of the
SpeechWorks voting agreements. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the form of voting agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex
E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint
proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

  AGREEMENT TO VOTE

     Each of Axel Bichara, Richard Burnes, Steven Chambers, Robert Finch, John
Freker, W. Robert Kellegrew, Stuart Patterson, Michael Phillips and Richard
Westelman has entered into a voting agreement with ScanSoft. Each of these
SpeechWorks directors and executive officers has agreed to vote his or her
shares of SpeechWorks common stock, and any and all options, warrants and other
rights to acquire shares of SpeechWorks common stock, (i) in favor of the merger
and the adoption and approval of the merger agreement, (ii) against any proposal
made in opposition to or in competition with the merger, (iii) against any
action that would delay, interfere or prevent the merger, (iv) against any
proposal that would result in a breach by SpeechWorks of the merger agreement,
and (v) against an election of a group of individuals to replace a majority or
more of the individuals on the SpeechWorks board of directors. Each
stockholder's obligation to vote in this manner applies whether or not the
SpeechWorks board of directors continues to recommend the merger to SpeechWorks
stockholders. These stockholders have the right, as of the SpeechWorks record
date, to vote a total of [     ] shares of SpeechWorks common stock or
approximately [     ]% of the outstanding shares of SpeechWorks common stock as
of the SpeechWorks record date.

     Each stockholder has also granted the directors on the board of directors
of ScanSoft an irrevocable proxy to vote the shares of SpeechWorks common stock
owned by such stockholder, including additional shares of SpeechWorks common
stock subsequently acquired, as described above.

  TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

     The voting agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts or limits
the ability of each stockholder that is a party to the agreement to sell,
transfer, tender pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his or
her shares of SpeechWorks common stock, or to agree to do the foregoing, other
than with ScanSoft's prior written consent. One exception to this restriction
allows each stockholder to sell shares of SpeechWorks common stock issued after
the initial filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus upon the exercise of
stock options and to sell shares of restricted common stock that have had
vesting accelerated in connection with the merger. In addition, the voting
agreement entered into by William O'Farrell, a member of the SpeechWorks board
of directors, allows him to sell any or all of his shares of SpeechWorks common
stock and the voting agreement entered into by Michael Phillips, a director and
Chief Technology Officer of Speechworks, allows him to sell up to 200,000 of his
shares of SpeechWorks common stock.

     SpeechWorks cannot determine the number of options that SpeechWorks
employees, officers and directors will exercise and, with respect to the shares
of SpeechWorks common stock issued upon exercise, sell prior to the effective
time of the merger. SpeechWorks expects, however, that all optionholders will
exercise their in-the-money options prior to the closing of the merger and that
most optionholders, including SpeechWorks executive officers and directors, will
elect to sell at least the portion of the shares issued upon exercise as is
necessary to recoup the exercise price and pay any tax liabilities which the
optionholder incurs in connection with the option exercise. In addition,
executive officers and directors and other employees may for personal reasons,
including to diversify their investment holdings, elect to sell the remaining
shares acquired upon exercise of options prior to the closing of the merger.

  TERMINATION

     The irrevocable proxy and voting agreement will terminate upon the earlier
to occur of:

     - the completion of the merger;

     - the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; or

     - the date as of which the stockholder's employment with SpeechWorks has
       been terminated by SpeechWorks.

AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS

     Each executive officer and director of SpeechWorks executed affiliate
agreements in his or her capacity as a stockholder. Under the affiliate
agreements, ScanSoft will be entitled to place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing any ScanSoft common stock to be received by each of the
persons who have entered into an affiliate agreement and to issue stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for ScanSoft common stock.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     Stuart R. Patterson.  On April 23, 2003, in connection with the execution
of the merger agreement, ScanSoft entered into an employment agreement with Mr.
Stuart R. Patterson, Chief Executive Officer of SpeechWorks, which is effective
upon the closing of the merger. Under the agreement, Mr. Patterson will serve as
President of ScanSoft and a member of its board of directors commencing with the
closing of the merger. Mr. Patterson will receive an annual base salary of
$275,000 through the first year of his employment, $300,000 through the second
year of his employment and $325,000 through the third year of his employment. If
other terms have not been agreed to by Mr. Patterson and ScanSoft, the base
salary will increase by $25,000 each year thereafter. For each fiscal year that
Mr. Patterson serves as President, Mr. Patterson will be eligible to receive a
bonus of up to 50% of his then annual base salary upon the

achievement of performance criteria established by the ScanSoft compensation
committee within four months of the commencement date of the applicable bonus
period. In addition, on the first anniversary of the effective date of the
merger, if ScanSoft has achieved certain performance goals related to the
integration of SpeechWorks and ScanSoft, then 50% of any then unvested shares of
SpeechWorks restricted common stock that were assumed in the merger by ScanSoft
will vest. Mr. Patterson's employment agreement may be terminated at any time,
upon 90 days written notice, with or without cause.

     On the closing date of the merger, Mr. Patterson will be granted a stock
option to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of ScanSoft common stock at
an exercise price equal to the fair market value of ScanSoft common stock on the
date of grant. The stock option will vest as to 1/16 of the original number of
shares subject to the option commencing on the date that is three months from
the closing date of the merger and on each three-month period thereafter. Under
the employment agreement, Mr. Patterson will also be entitled to participate in
the employee benefit plans of ScanSoft in which other ScanSoft senior executive
officers are entitled to participate, including medical, dental and life
insurance plans.

     If Mr. Patterson's employment is terminated by Mr. Patterson after the one
year anniversary of the effective date of the merger or, at any time, for a
reason other than (i) cause, (ii) good reason or (iii) death or disablement,
then, subject to Mr. Patterson's compliance with the surviving provisions of a
confidentiality agreement entered into with ScanSoft and his execution of a
general release for the benefit of ScanSoft, Mr. Patterson is entitled to
receive the following benefits:

     - payment of his then annual base salary during the applicable severance
       period, which ranges from 18 months if termination occurs within six
       months of the merger to 12 months if termination occurs after 12 months
       of the merger;

     - continued participation in the employee benefit plans of ScanSoft; and

     - acceleration of any then unvested options to purchase shares of ScanSoft
       common stock or restricted common stock of ScanSoft that would have
       vested during the applicable severance period, with the right to exercise
       any vested stock option until the earlier of one year from the date of
       termination or the expiration of the applicable stock option.

     In addition to any other benefits Mr. Patterson may be entitled to, if,
within six months following a change of control of ScanSoft, Mr. Patterson's
employment is terminated for a reason other than (i) cause, (ii) good reason or
(iii) death or disablement, then, subject to Mr. Patterson's compliance with the
confidentiality agreement and his execution of a general release, Mr. Patterson
is entitled to full acceleration of any then unvested options to purchase shares
of ScanSoft common stock or restricted common stock of ScanSoft.

     Richard J. Westelman.  SpeechWorks is a party to an at-will employment
agreement with Mr. Richard J. Westelman, Chief Financial Officer of SpeechWorks,
dated June 21, 2000. Under the agreement, Mr. Westelman currently receives a
base salary of $162,000. If Mr. Westelman is terminated without cause, all
outstanding options previously granted to him will become immediately
exercisable to the extent that they are not already vested, and SpeechWorks,
including as the surviving corporation in the merger, is required to pay Mr.
Westelman his then current base salary for a period of 12 months and his health
insurance premiums for the earlier of 12 months or until he becomes eligible for
another comparable plan. In addition, if Mr. Westelman is terminated without
cause, his employment agreement provides that he is entitled to receive a
one-year recourse loan from SpeechWorks for up to $426,000 at the prime rate to
enable him to exercise his stock options. If Mr. Westelman voluntarily
terminates his employment, 50% of all outstanding options previously granted to
him which are then unvested will become immediately exercisable, and SpeechWorks
is required to pay Mr. Westelman his then current base salary for six months and
his health insurance premiums for the earlier of six months or until he becomes
eligible for another comparable plan.

          AMENDMENT OF THE SCANSOFT 1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     The ScanSoft 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1995 ESPP") provides
ScanSoft employees with an opportunity to purchase ScanSoft common stock through
accumulated payroll deductions. Employees make such purchases by participation
in regular offering periods from which they may withdraw at any time.

     The ScanSoft board of directors has approved an amendment to the 1995 ESPP,
subject to stockholder approval, to increase the number of shares authorized for
issuance thereunder from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000. If the amendment is approved,
Section 12 of the 1995 ESPP would read in its entirety as follows:

        "The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which shall be made
        available for sale under the Plan shall be one million five hundred
        thousand (1,500,000) shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in
        capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 18." (Change shown
        in italics.)

GENERAL

     The 1995 ESPP is intended to qualify under the provisions of Section 423 of
the Code, is not a qualified deferred compensation plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and is not subject to the provisions of ERISA. A total of 1,000,000
shares are currently authorized to be issued under the 1995 ESPP. As of December
31, 2002, a total of 688,388 shares had been issued to ScanSoft's employees
under the 1995 ESPP, and 311,612 shares remained available for future issuance.
The average per share issuance price for shares purchased by employees under the
1995 ESPP to date is approximately $2.74. As of December 31, 2002, approximately
264 employees were eligible to participate in the 1995 ESPP.

PURPOSE

     The purpose of the 1995 ESPP is to provide employees with an opportunity to
purchase ScanSoft common stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Employees
make such purchases by participation in regular offering periods from which they
may withdraw at any time.

ADMINISTRATION

     The 1995 ESPP may be administered by the ScanSoft board of directors or a
committee appointed by the ScanSoft board of directors. Currently the 1995 ESPP
is administered by the ScanSoft board of directors. The ScanSoft board of
directors or its committee has full power to adopt, amend and rescind any rules
deemed desirable and appropriate for the administration of the 1995 ESPP, to
construe and interpret the 1995 ESPP, and to make all other determinations
necessary or advisable for the administration of the 1995 ESPP.

ELIGIBILITY

     Any person who, on the first day of an offering period, is customarily
employed by ScanSoft for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in
any calendar year is eligible to participate in the 1995 ESPP.

OFFERING DATES

     In general, the 1995 ESPP is implemented by a series of offering periods of
12 months duration, with new offering periods commencing on or about February 16
and August 16 of each year. Each offering period consists of two consecutive
purchase periods of six months duration, with the last day of such period being
designated a purchase date. The ScanSoft board of directors has the power to
change the duration and frequency of the offering and purchase periods with
respect to future offerings without stockholder approval if such change is
announced at least fifteen days prior to the scheduled beginning of the first
offering or purchase period to be affected.

PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN

     Eligible employees may participate in the 1995 ESPP by completing an
enrollment form provided by ScanSoft and filing it with ScanSoft prior to the
applicable offering date, unless a later time for filing the enrollment form is
set by the ScanSoft board of directors for all eligible employees with respect
to a given offering. The enrollment form currently authorizes payroll deductions
of not less than 1% and not more than 12% of the participant's eligible
compensation on the date of the purchase.

PURCHASE PRICE

     The purchase price per share sold under the 1995 ESPP is a price equal to
the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning
of the offering period or the purchase date. The fair market value is the per
share closing price of the common stock on the NASDAQ National Market as of such
date reported by NASDAQ.

PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS

     The purchase price of the shares is accumulated by payroll deductions
during the offering period. The deductions may be up to 12% of a participant's
eligible compensation received on each payday during the offering period.
Eligible compensation is defined in the 1995 ESPP to include the regular
straight time gross earnings excluding payments for overtime, shift premium,
incentive compensation, bonuses and commissions. A participant may discontinue
his or her participation in the 1995 ESPP at any time during the offering period
prior to a purchase date, and may decrease the rate of his or her payroll
deductions once during the offering period by completing and filing a new
enrollment form. No interest accrues on the payroll deductions of a participant
in the 1995 ESPP.

PURCHASE OF STOCK; EXERCISE OF OPTION

     By executing an enrollment form to participate in the 1995 ESPP, the
participant is entitled to have shares placed under option. Unless the
participant's participation is discontinued, each participant's option for the
purchase of shares will be exercised automatically at the end of each purchase
period at the applicable price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no participant
shall be permitted to subscribe for shares under the 1995 ESPP if immediately
after the grant of the option he or she would own 5% or more of the voting power
or value of all classes of ScanSoft's stock or of any of ScanSoft's subsidiaries
(including stock which may be purchased under the 1995 ESPP or pursuant to any
other options), nor shall any participant be granted an option which would
permit the participant to buy pursuant to all of ScanSoft's employee stock
purchase plans more than $25,000 worth of stock (determined at the fair market
value of the shares at the time the option is granted) in any calendar year.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Upon termination of a participant's continuous status as an employee prior
to the purchase date of an offering period for any reason, including retirement
or death, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and
the contributions credited to his or her account but not yet used to exercise
his or her option under the Plan will be returned to him or her.

NONTRANSFERABILITY

     No rights or accumulated payroll deductions of a participant under the 1995
ESPP may be pledged, assigned or transferred for any reason.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

     The board of directors may at any time amend or terminate the 1995 ESPP,
except that such termination shall not affect options previously granted.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION

     The following brief summary of the effect of federal income taxation upon
the participant and ScanSoft with respect to the shares purchased under the 1995
ESPP does not purport to be complete, and does not discuss the tax consequences
of a participant's death or the income tax laws of any state or foreign country
in which the participant may reside.

     The 1995 ESPP, and the right of participants to make purchases thereunder,
is intended to qualify under the provisions of Sections 421 and 423 of the Code.
Under these provisions, no income will be taxable to a participant until the
shares purchased under the ScanSoft ESPP are sold or otherwise disposed of. Upon
sale or other disposition of the shares, the participant will generally be
subject to tax in an amount that depends upon the holding period. If the shares
are sold or otherwise disposed of more than two years from the first day of the
applicable offering period and one year from the applicable date of purchase,
the participant will recognize ordinary income measured as the lesser of (a) the
excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such sale or
disposition over the purchase price, or (b) an amount equal to 15% of the fair
market value of the shares as of the first day of the applicable offering
period. Any additional gain will be treated as long-term capital gain. If the
shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of these holding
periods, the participant will recognize ordinary income generally measured as
the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares are
purchased over the purchase price. Any additional gain or loss on such sale or
disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on
how long the shares have been held from the date of purchase. ScanSoft generally
is not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital
gain to a participant except to the extent of ordinary income recognized by
participants upon a sale or disposition of shares prior to the expiration of the
holding periods described above.

VOTE REQUIRED; RECOMMENDATION OF THE SCANSOFT BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The proposal to amend the ScanSoft 1995 ESPP requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes of ScanSoft common stock, voting as a single class,
cast at the ScanSoft special meeting.

     THE SCANSOFT BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SCANSOFT
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF THE SCANSOFT 1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK
PURCHASE PLAN.

months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the balance sheet data as of March 31,
2003 have been derived from ScanSoft's unaudited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, which
in the opinion of ScanSoft's management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of
only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations for these periods.

     On March 2, 1999, ScanSoft's predecessor acquired ScanSoft, Inc., an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox Corporation. On June 30, 1999,
ScanSoft acquired certain assets and liabilities of MetaCreations Corporation.
On March 13, 2000, ScanSoft acquired Caere Corporation. On December 12, 2001,
ScanSoft acquired substantially all of the speech and language technology
operations of Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V. ("L&H"). On January 30,
2003, ScanSoft acquired the Philips Speech Processing Telephony and Voice
Control business units of Royal Philips Electronics ("PSP"). These acquisitions
were each accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly,
the results of operations from the ScanSoft, MetaCreations, Caere, L&H and PSP
acquisitions are included in ScanSoft's results of operations from the
applicable acquisition dates.

     Through December 1998, ScanSoft developed and sold scanner hardware and
software products. On January 6, 1999, ScanSoft sold its hardware business.
Accordingly, the results of the hardware business are included in ScanSoft's
results of operations through the date of disposal.

                SELECTED QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS OF SCANSOFT

     The following table sets forth unaudited quarterly consolidated statement
of operations data for the nine quarters ended March 31, 2003 as well as the
percentage of total revenue represented by each item. The information for each
of these quarters has been prepared on substantially the same basis as the
audited financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and, in the opinion of ScanSoft's management, includes all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the
fair presentation of the results of operations for such periods. This quarterly
information reflects the adoption of EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products),
as described in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. The financial data
as presented in table should be read in conjunction with such consolidated
financial statements. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2003
or any future period.

                     SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA OF SPEECHWORKS

     The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements of
SpeechWorks and related notes thereto included in SpeechWorks annual reports,
quarterly reports and other information on file with the SEC. See "Where You Can
Find More Information" on page   .

     The statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 have
been derived from SpeechWorks' consolidated financial statements audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, which have been
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. The
statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and
the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been derived
from SpeechWorks' consolidated financial statements audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, which are not included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. The statement of operations
data for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the balance sheet
data as of March 31, 2003 have been derived from SpeechWorks' unaudited
consolidated financial statements, which have been incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, and in the opinion of SpeechWorks'
management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and
results of operations for these periods.

     On January 1, 2002, SpeechWorks adopted Statement of Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets and ceased amortizing goodwill. During
the year ended December 31, 2001, SpeechWorks' operating results included
$2,677,000 of goodwill amortization expense; there was no goodwill amortization
recorded in years prior to 2001. In addition, certain amounts of SpeechWorks'
financial statements for the years prior to December 31, 2002 have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation in the financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2002. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
net loss.

                     SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
                                 FINANCIAL DATA

     The following tables show summary unaudited pro forma financial information
as if ScanSoft, SpeechWorks, and the Philips Speech Processing Telephony and
Voice Control business units of Royal Philips Electronics ("PSP") had been
combined as of the beginning of the period for statement of operations purposes
and as if ScanSoft and SpeechWorks had been combined as of March 31, 2003 for
balance sheet purposes. On January 30, 2003, ScanSoft completed the acquisition
of PSP on the terms set forth in the purchase agreement dated October 7, 2002,
as amended. PSP offers speech-enabled services including directory assistance,
interactive voice response and voice portal applications for enterprise
customers, telephony vendors and carriers through its Telephony business unit
and a product portfolio including small footprint speech recognition engines for
embedded applications such as voice-controlled climate, navigation and
entertainment features in automotive vehicles, as well as voice dialing for
mobile phones through its Voice Control business unit. The acquisition of PSP
was accounted for as a purchase of a business. The consolidated balance sheet of
ScanSoft at March 31, 2003 includes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
of PSP. The results of operations of PSP for the period subsequent to January
30, 2003 are included in the unaudited historical consolidated statement of
operations data of ScanSoft.

     The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data are derived from
the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, which give effect to
ScanSoft's acquisition of PSP in January 2003 and the proposed merger of
ScanSoft and SpeechWorks using the purchase method of accounting and should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements
and the notes thereto included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial data are based on estimates and
assumptions, which are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of
developing such pro forma information. The estimated pro forma adjustments
arising from the acquisitions of PSP and SpeechWorks are derived from the
estimated purchase price and estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The final determination of purchase price, fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill may differ
significantly from that reflected in the pro forma statement of operations and
balance sheet. The pro forma data are presented for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial
position that would have occurred if each transaction had been consummated as of
January 1, 2002 for the statement of operations or March 31, 2003 for the
balance sheet, respectively, nor are the pro forma data necessarily indicative
of future operating results or financial position.

     The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and
related notes thereto, the historical consolidated financial statements of
ScanSoft and PSP, and related notes thereto, and "ScanSoft's Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations",
included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the historical
consolidated financial statements of SpeechWorks, incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus or as filed by SpeechWorks with the SEC.

                   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING SCANSOFT

SCANSOFT'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On January 3, 2003, ScanSoft paid $3.3 million in full settlement of all
principal and accrued interest on the promissory note issued in connection with
its acquisition of substantially all of the speech and language technology
operations of Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V. ("L&H") on December 12,
2001. Additionally, on December 18, 2002, ScanSoft issued 81,900 and 68,100
shares of its common stock to L&H and L&H Holdings USA, Inc., respectively.
These shares were issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
share repurchase agreement entered into with L&H in September 2002.

     On January 30, 2003, ScanSoft completed the acquisition of the Speech
Processing Telephony and Voice Control business units of Royal Philips
Electronics N.V. ("Philips"), and related intellectual property, on the terms
set forth in the purchase agreement dated October 7, 2002, as amended. The
Telephony business unit offers speech-enabled services, including directory
assistance, interactive voice response and voice portal applications for
enterprise customers, telephony vendors and carriers. The Voice Control business
unit offers a product portfolio including small footprint speech recognition
engines for embedded applications such as voice-controlled climate, navigation
and entertainment features in automotive vehicles, as well as voice dialing for
mobile phones. As consideration for these business units and intellectual
property, ScanSoft paid 3.1 million euros ($3.4 million) in cash at closing,
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the purchase
agreement, as amended, and agreed to pay an additional 1.0 million euros in cash
prior to December 31, 2003, issued a 5.0 million euro note due December 31, 2003
and bearing 5.0% interest per annum and issued a $27.5 million three-year, zero-
interest subordinated debenture, convertible at any time at Philips' option into
shares of ScanSoft common stock at $6.00 per share. ScanSoft anticipates that
all related adjustments will be completed no later than December 31, 2003. The
technology acquired includes several speech recognition and voice control
products. In conjunction with the acquisition, the business operations of
ScanSoft were significantly restructured, which has caused disruption in the
employee and customer base of ScanSoft. The Philips operations had consisted of
approximately 250 employees of which ScanSoft hired only 116. Based on its prior
acquisition experience, ScanSoft expects revenue and earnings to be weighted
toward the second half of the year as ScanSoft completes the integration of its
sales team and re-engages Philip customers, partners and channels.

     On February 14, 2003, ScanSoft completed an underwritten public offering of
7,184,406 shares of its common stock at $3.80 per share. Of the total shares
sold, 6,184,406 shares were sold on behalf of L&H and L&H Holdings USA, Inc.
ScanSoft sold 1,000,000 common shares and received gross proceeds of $3.8
million. On March 12, 2003, ScanSoft received $4.1 million of gross proceeds
from the exercise of the
