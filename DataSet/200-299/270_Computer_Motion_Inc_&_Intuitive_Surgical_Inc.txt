Subject to completion, dated March 28,

MERGER PROPOSED  YOUR VOTE IS VERY
IMPORTANT

Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Computer Motion,
Inc. have agreed to a combination of the two companies under the
terms of a merger agreement. We are proposing the merger because
we believe it will benefit the stockholders of both companies by
combining the strengths of the companies in operative surgical
robotics, telesurgery and operating room integration to better
serve hospitals, doctors and patients.

Upon completion of the merger, Computer Motion
stockholders will be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Intuitive Surgical common stock for each share of Computer
Motion common stock owned as of the effective time of the
merger. The fraction of a share of Intuitive Surgical common
stock to be issued with respect to each share of Computer Motion
common stock will be determined by a formula described in the
merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.
Based on the capitalization of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion and the market price of Computer Motion common stock as
of the date of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus and
assuming that the merger is completed on June 20, 2003, we
estimate that the exchange ratio will be approximately 0.52. The
exchange ratio will be adjusted proportionately in the event
that the proposed reverse split of Intuitive Surgicals
common stock is approved by Intuitive Surgicals
stockholders and implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors.
After                   ,
2003, stockholders may visit Intuitive Surgicals website,

www.intuitivesurgical.com
, or Computer Motions
website, 
www.computermotion.com
, for announcements
regarding the exchange ratio. Stockholders of Intuitive Surgical
will continue to own their existing shares.

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and reserve an additional approximately
5.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock for
future issuance in connection with Intuitive Surgicals
assumption of Computer Motions outstanding options and
warrants (including out-of-the-money options and warrants).

Intuitive Surgical common stock is traded on the
Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
ISRG. On March 27, 2003, Intuitive Surgical
common stock closed at $5.78 per share as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market.

The merger cannot be completed unless Intuitive
Surgical stockholders approve the issuance of shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
and Computer Motion stockholders approve and adopt the merger
agreement. The obligations of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion to complete the merger are also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of several conditions. More information
about Intuitive Surgical, Computer Motion and the merger, as
well as additional business to be conducted at the Intuitive
Surgical stockholder meeting, is contained in this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus. 
We encourage you to read this joint
proxy statement/ prospectus, including the section entitled
Risk Factors beginning on page 19, before
voting.

The board of directors of Intuitive Surgical has
approved the merger agreement and the issuance of shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. The board of directors of Computer Motion has
approved the merger agreement. Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors unanimously recommends that Intuitive Surgical
stockholders vote 
FOR 
the proposal to issue
shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. Computer Motions board of directors unanimously
recommends that Computer Motion stockholders vote

FOR 
the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement.

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion have each
scheduled a stockholder meeting in connection with the
respective votes required. Your vote is very important. Whether
or not you plan to attend your respective companys
stockholder meeting, please take the time to vote by marking
your votes on the enclosed proxy card, signing and dating the

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion have
    agreed to combine pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement
    that is described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A
    copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
    statement/prospectus as Annex A. In order to complete the
    merger, Intuitive Surgical stockholders must vote to approve the
    issuance of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant
    to the merger agreement and Computer Motion stockholders must
    vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

these approvals. In addition to the proposal to issue shares of
Intuitive common stock pursuant to the merger agreement,
Intuitive Surgical stockholders will also be asked

     

to approve an amendment to Intuitive
    Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation to effect a 1-for-2 reverse stock split;

     

to elect three Class III members of
    Intuitive Surgicals board of directors;

    provision; and

     

to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young
    LLP as Intuitive Surgicals independent auditors for the
    current fiscal year ending December 31, 2003.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains
    important information about the merger, the additional proposals
    to be considered by the stockholders of Intuitive Surgical and
    the stockholder meetings of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
    Motion, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting
    materials allow you to vote your shares without attending your
    stockholder meeting.

Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote
as soon as possible.

Q: 

Why are Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
    proposing the merger?

A:

We believe that the merger will provide
    substantial strategic and financial benefits to the stockholders
    of both companies. We believe that the combination will create a
    stronger and more competitive company that will be able to
    better serve the surgical community. We are proposing the merger
    because we believe it will benefit the stockholders of both
    companies by combining the strengths of the companies in
    operative surgical robotics, telesurgery and operating room
    integration to better serve hospitals, doctors and patients. The
    merger will also result in the dismissal of the pending patent
    litigations between Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion. To
    review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, please see
    The Merger  Reasons For the Merger 
    Intuitive Surgical and The Merger 
    Reasons For the Merger  Computer Motion.

Q: 

What will happen in the merger?

A:

The businesses of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
    Motion will be combined in a stock-for-stock transaction. At the
    closing, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive
    Surgical will merge with Computer Motion, with Computer Motion
    surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive
    Surgical. In exchange for their shares of Computer Motion stock,
    the former stockholders of Computer Motion will receive shares
    of Intuitive Surgical common stock.

Q: 

What will I receive for my Computer Motion
    shares in the merger?

A:

Upon completion of the merger, Computer Motion
    stockholders will be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
    of Intuitive Surgical common stock for each share of Computer
    Motion common stock owned as of the effective time of the
    merger. The fraction of a share of Intuitive Surgical common
    stock to be issued with respect to each share of Computer Motion
    common stock will be determined by a formula described in the
    merger agreement



and this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Based
    on the capitalization of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
    and the market price of Computer Motion common stock as of the
    date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and assuming that
    the merger is completed on June 20, 2003, we estimate that
    the exchange ratio will be approximately 0.52. The exchange
    ratio will be adjusted proportionately in the event that the
    proposed reverse split of Intuitive Surgicals common stock
    is approved by Intuitive Surgicals stockholders and
    implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board of directors.

The final exchange ratio will be calculated based
on the total number of fully diluted shares outstanding for
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion (including
out-of-the-money options and warrants for both companies)
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The
number of Computer Motions fully diluted shares will vary
based on the number of shares of Computer Motion common stock
into which Computer Motions Series D convertible
preferred stock will be convertible and the number of shares of
Computer Motion common stock which may be issued to pay accrued
dividends on the Series D convertible preferred stock upon
conversion. All shares of Computer Motion Series D
convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of Computer
Motion common stock immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger. Under the terms of the Series D convertible
preferred stock, in the event that the average of the closing
bid prices of Computer Motions common stock for the 20
consecutive trading days ending 15 days prior to the
Computer Motion special meeting is below $1.86 per share, the
conversion ratio for Computer Motions Series D
convertible preferred stock could increase. As a result, the
exchange ratio in the merger may decrease and, therefore,
Computer Motion common stockholders would receive a lesser
number of Intuitive Surgical shares, and Computer Motion
preferred stockholders would receive a greater number of
Intuitive Surgical shares, in the merger.
After                     ,
2003, stockholders may visit Intuitive Surgicals website,

www.intuitivesurgical.com,
 or Computer Motions
website, 
www.computermotion.com,
 for announcements
regarding the exchange ratio. Computer Motion stockholders will
receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of Intuitive
Surgical common stock. Please see The Merger
Agreement  The Merger Consideration and Conversion of
Securities.

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and reserve approximately 5.7 million shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock for future issuance in
connection with Intuitive Surgicals assumption of Computer
Motions outstanding options and warrants (including
out-of-the-money options and warrants).

Q: 

What will happen to the pending litigations
    between Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion?

A:

In connection with the proposed merger, Intuitive
    Surgical and Computer Motion have obtained an immediate stay
    through August 31, 2003 of all proceedings in the pending
    litigation proceedings between the companies. As part of the
    stays, the courts have ceased all further activity in the cases
    during the period of stays and will not issue any opinions or
    orders on issues already submitted for decision. The stays may
    be terminated before, or extended beyond, August 31, 2003
    under specified circumstances. In the event the merger is
    completed, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion will request
    dismissal with prejudice of the pending litigations.

Q: 

Why is Intuitive Surgical proposing to amend
    its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation?

A:

The board of directors of Intuitive Surgical
    believes that it is in the best interests of Intuitive Surgical
    to effect a 1-for-2 reverse split of Intuitive Surgicals
    common stock. The reverse stock split is intended to increase
    the marketability and liquidity of Intuitive Surgicals
    common stock. The Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation of Intuitive Surgical is being amended to effect
    the reverse stock split.



Q: 

Who has been nominated for election to the
    board of directors of Intuitive Surgical?

A:

The board of directors of Intuitive Surgical has
    nominated James A. Lawrence, Lonnie M. Smith and Richard J.
    Kramer, each of whom is a current director of Intuitive
    Surgical, for election to the board of directors. In addition,
    upon completion of the merger, the size of Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors will be increased to nine and
    Robert W. Duggan, Computer Motions Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, and Eric H. Halvorson, a member of Computer
    Motions board of directors, will be appointed to Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors.

Q: 

Why is Intuitive Surgical proposing to amend
    its 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option
    Plan?

A:

Intuitive Surgical is proposing to amend its 2000
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan to increase the
    annual stock option grant for non-employee directors from 5,000
    to 10,000 shares, to provide for an additional annual grant of
    options to purchase 5,000 shares to committee chairs and to
    amend the automatic share increase provision. These share
    amounts will be reduced proportionately in the event that the
    proposed reverse split of Intuitive Surgicals common stock
    is approved by Intuitive Surgicals stockholders and
    implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board of directors.

Q: 

Where and when are the stockholder
    meetings?

A:

The Intuitive Surgical annual meeting will take
    place at the Summerfield Suites by Wyndham, 900 Hamlin
    Court, Sunnyvale, California 94086,

local time.

Q: 

What vote of Intuitive Surgical stockholders
    is required to approve the proposals?

A:

    Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
    requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes
    cast at the annual meeting by holders of Intuitive
    Surgicals common stock outstanding as of the record date.
    Directors and executive officers of Intuitive Surgical owning
    Intuitive Surgical common stock representing approximately 7% of
    the shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock outstanding as of
    the record date have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the
    proposal to issue shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock
    pursuant to the merger agreement.

Approval of the proposal to amend Intuitive

the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock outstanding as of the record date. The
candidates for director receiving the highest number of votes,
up to the number of directors to be elected, will be elected to
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors. Approval of the
proposal to amend Intuitive Surgicals 2000 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan to increase the annual stock
option grant for non-employee directors, to provide for an
additional annual grant of options to committee chairs and to
amend the automatic share increase provision and the proposal to

Q: 

What do I do now?

A:

Carefully read and consider the information
    contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including
    its appendices. There are several ways your shares can be
    represented at your stockholder meeting. You can attend your
    stockholder meeting in person or you can indicate on the
    enclosed proxy card how you want to vote and return it in the
    accompanying pre-addressed postage paid envelope. If you sign
    and send in your proxy but do not indicate how you want to vote,
    your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the proposals.

Q: 

How do I cast my vote?

A:

If you are a holder of record, you may vote in
    person at your stockholder meeting or by submitting a proxy for
    your stockholder meeting. You can submit your proxy by
    completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy
    card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage paid envelope.

Q: 

If my broker holds my shares in street
    name, will my broker vote my shares?

A:

If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage
    account or if your shares are held by a bank or nominee
    (
i.e.
, in street name), you should provide the record
    holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your
    shares. Please refer to the voting instruction card used by your
    broker or nominee to see if you may submit voting instructions
    by telephone.

Q: 

Can I change my vote after I have delivered my
    proxy?

A:

Yes. You can change your vote at any time before
    your proxy is voted at your stockholder meeting. You can do this
    in one of three ways: (1) you can send a signed notice of
    revocation; (2) you can grant a new, valid proxy; or
    (3) if you are a holder of record, you can attend your
    stockholder meeting and vote in person; however, your attendance
    alone will not revoke your proxy. If you choose either of the
    first two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or
    your new proxy to the Secretary of Intuitive Surgical or
    Computer Motion, as appropriate, before the applicable
    stockholder meeting. However, if your shares are held in a
    street name account at a brokerage firm or bank, you should
    contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your vote.

Q: 

What will happen if I abstain from
    voting?

A:

In the case of Intuitive Surgical, abstentions
    will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote
    for purposes of determining the



presence of a quorum at the annual meeting.
    Abstentions (1) will have the same effect as voting against
    the proposal to approve the amendment to Intuitive
    Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation to effect a 1-for-2 reverse stock split and
    (2) will not have any impact on approval of the proposal to
    issue Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger
    agreement or any of the other proposals.

In the case of Computer Motion, abstentions will
be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the special
meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as voting against
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Q: 

Should I send in my Computer Motion stock
    certificates now?

A:

No. After the merger is completed, you will
    receive written instructions from the exchange agent on how to
    exchange your Computer Motion stock certificates for Intuitive
    Surgical stock certificates. 
Please do not send in your
    Computer Motion stock certificates with your proxy.

Q: 

What should I do if I receive more than one
    set of voting materials?

A:

You may receive more than one set of voting
    materials, including multiple copies of this joint proxy
    statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting
    instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more
    than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
    instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold
    shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are
    registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one
    proxy card. In addition, if you are a stockholder of Intuitive
    Surgical and a stockholder of Computer Motion, you will receive
    one or more separate proxy cards or voting instruction cards for
    each company. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy
    card and voting instruction card that you receive.

When do you expect the merger to be
    completed?

A:

We are working to complete the merger as quickly
    as practicable. We currently expect to complete the merger in
    the second quarter of 2003. However, we cannot predict the exact
    timing of the completion of the merger.

Q: 

What rights do I have to seek a valuation or
    appraisal of my shares?

A:

Neither Intuitive Surgical stockholders nor
    Computer Motion stockholders will have appraisal rights in
    connection with the proposals to be voted on.

Q: 

What are the expected United States federal
    income tax consequences of the transaction?

A:

The merger has been structured to qualify as a
    reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming
    that the merger so qualifies, then, in general, Computer Motion
    stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except that
    Computer Motion stockholders will recognize gain or loss with
    respect to any cash they receive in lieu of a fractional share
    of Intuitive Surgical common stock upon completion of the
    merger. No gain or loss will be recognized by Intuitive Surgical
    stockholders as a result of the merger.

The Companies

Intuitive Surgical,
    Inc.
     950 Kifer
    Road
     Sunnyvale, California

     (408) 523-2100

     Intuitive Surgical designs,
    manufactures and markets the 
da Vinci 
Surgical System, an
    advanced surgical system that Intuitive Surgical believes
    represents a new generation of surgery  the third
    generation. Intuitive Surgical believes that this new generation
    of surgery, referred to as 
Intuitive 
surgery, is a
    revolutionary advance similar in scope to the previous two
    generations of surgery  open surgery and minimally
    invasive surgery, or MIS. Intuitive Surgicals 
da Vinci

Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, a
    patient side-cart, a high performance vision system and
    proprietary wristed instruments. By placing
    computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and patient,
    Intuitive Surgical believes that its system enables surgeons to
    perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The

da Vinci 
Surgical System seamlessly translates the
    surgeons natural hand movements on instrument controls at
    a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments
    positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions,
    or ports. The 
da Vinci 
Surgical System provides the
    surgeon with the intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue
    manipulation capability and 3-D visualization characteristic of
    open surgery, while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work
    through the small ports of MIS.

Computer Motion,
    Inc.
     130-B Cremona
    Drive
     Goleta, California

     (805) 968-9600

     Computer Motion is a high-tech
    medical device company developing surgical practices with the
    goal of ushering in a new era of patient and physician friendly
    surgery. This new era is expected to significantly reduce
    patient trauma and recovery time and to dramatically reduce the
    learning curves of surgeons adapting these new, less invasive
    techniques. Computer Motions products automate operating
    room tasks and simplify various aspects of surgical procedures,
    reducing operating cost and time. Computer Motions
    products, including surgeon training and education services,
    play a significant role in transitioning the surgical community
    from open procedures to less invasive procedures increasingly
    demanded by patients. Computer Motions products have been
    successfully used across a broad range of surgical disciplines,
    including cardiac, urology, pediatrics, bariatrics and general
    surgery.

     Computer Motion develops and
    markets robotic and computerized surgical systems that are
    upgradeable and based on an open system platform, which allows
    for networking of the entire operating room. These systems
    enhance a surgeons performance and centralize and simplify
    a surgeons control of the operating room. Computer
    Motions products provide surgeons with the natural
    functionality necessary to perform complex MIS procedures, as
    well as enable surgeons to control critical devices in the
    operating room through simple verbal commands. Computer Motion
    believes its products will broaden the scope and increase the
    effectiveness of MIS, improve patient outcomes and create a
    safer, more efficient and cost-effective operating room.



The Merger

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion have
agreed to the combination of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion under the terms of the merger agreement described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We have attached the merger
agreement as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
We encourage you to read the merger agreement in its entirety.

Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Intuitive Merger Corporation, a newly formed subsidiary of
Intuitive Surgical, will merge with and into Computer Motion,
with Computer Motion surviving the merger and continuing as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive Surgical. Upon completion
of the merger, each share of Computer Motion common stock will
be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of
Intuitive Surgical common stock. The fraction of a share of
Intuitive Surgical common stock to be issued with respect to
each share of Computer Motion common stock will be determined by
a formula described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Based on the capitalization of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion and the market price of Computer
Motion common stock as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and assuming that the merger is completed
on June 20, 2003, we estimate that the exchange ratio will
be approximately 0.52. The exchange ratio will be adjusted
proportionately in the event that the proposed reverse split of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock is approved by Intuitive
Surgicals stockholders and implemented by Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors.

The final exchange ratio will be calculated based
on the total number of fully diluted shares outstanding for
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. The number of Computer
Motions fully diluted shares will vary based on the number
of shares of Computer Motion common stock into which Computer
Motions Series D convertible preferred stock will be
convertible and the number of shares of Computer Motion common
stock which may be issued to pay accrued dividends on the
Series D convertible preferred stock upon conversion. All
shares of Computer Motion Series D convertible preferred
stock will convert into shares of Computer Motion common stock
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Under the
terms of the Series D convertible preferred stock, in the
event that the average of the closing bid prices of Computer
Motions common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days
ending 15 days prior to the Computer Motion special meeting
is below $1.86 per share, the conversion ratio for Computer
Motions Series D convertible preferred stock could
increase. As a result, the exchange ratio in the merger may
decrease and, therefore, Computer Motion common stockholders
would receive a lesser number of Intuitive Surgical shares, and
Computer Motion preferred stockholders would receive a greater
number of Intuitive Surgical shares, in the merger.
After                     ,
2003, stockholders may visit Intuitive Surgicals website,

www.intuitivesurgical.com,
 or Computer Motions
website, 
www.computermotion.com,
 for announcements
regarding the exchange ratio. Computer Motion stockholders will
receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock. Please see The Merger
Agreement  The Merger Consideration and Conversion of
Securities.

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and reserve approximately 5.7 million shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock for future issuance in
connection with Intuitive Surgicals assumption of Computer
Motions outstanding options and warrants (including
out-of-the-money options and warrants).

In connection with the proposed merger, Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion have obtained an immediate stay
through August 31, 2003 of all proceedings in the pending
litigations between the companies. As part of the stays, the
courts have ceased all further activity in the cases during the
period of stays and will not issue any opinions or orders on
issues already submitted for decision. The stays may be
terminated before, or extended beyond, August 31, 2003
under specified circumstances. In the event the merger is
completed, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion will request
dismissal with prejudice of the pending litigations.

2003, the record date for the Computer Motion special meeting.
On that date, there
were                    shares
of Computer Motion common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
and 8,797 shares of Computer Motion Series D convertible
preferred stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Holders of
Computer Motion common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share of Computer Motion common stock owned on the record date,
and holders of Computer Motion Series D convertible
preferred stock are entitled to 1,000 votes for each share of
Computer Motion Series D convertible preferred stock owned
on that date. Approval and adoption of the merger agreement
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of
outstanding shares of Computer Motion common stock and preferred
stock, voting together as a single class, at the Computer Motion
special meeting.

Stockholder Support Agreements

Intuitive Surgical has entered into a stockholder
support agreements with directors and executive officers of
Intuitive Surgical owning Intuitive Surgical common stock
representing approximately 7% of the shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock outstanding as of the record date,
pursuant to which these stockholders agreed to vote their shares
in favor of the proposal to issue Intuitive Surgical common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement. This stockholder support
agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex B.

Intuitive Surgical has entered into stockholder
support agreements with directors and executive officers of
Computer Motion owning Computer Motion common and preferred
stock representing approximately 14% of the voting power of the
Computer Motion common and preferred stock outstanding as of the
record date, pursuant to which these stockholders agreed to vote
their shares in favor of proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. The form of these stockholder support
agreements is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex C.

Surgical

On March 6, 2003, Bear, Stearns &
Co. Inc. delivered its oral opinion to Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated as of March 6, 2003, based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the
opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
Intuitive Surgical of the exchange ratio in the merger. The full
text of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.s written opinion
is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex D. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in
its entirety for a description of the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the

On March 5, 2003,
H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. delivered to Computer
Motions board of directors its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
March 5, 2003, that, as of that date, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion,
the merger consideration to be received by the holders of the

was fair to these holders, from a financial point of view. The
full text of H.C. Wainwrights written opinion is attached
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. We
encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for
a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken.
H.C. Wainwrights opinion is directed to Computer
Motions board of directors and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to any matters relating to
the merger.

Ownership of the Combined Company after the
Merger

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and reserve an additional approximately
5.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock for
future issuance in connection with Intuitive Surgicals
assumption of Computer Motions outstanding options and
warrants (including out-of-the-money options and warrants).
Based on the estimated exchange ratio of approximately 0.52, we
further estimate that, upon completion of the merger, current
Intuitive Surgical stockholders will own approximately 72% of
the then outstanding shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock
and former Computer Motion stockholders will own approximately
28% of the then outstanding shares of Intuitive Surgical common
stock.

Loan and Security Agreement

In connection with the merger agreement,
Intuitive Surgical has agreed to provide a short-term secured
bridge loan facility of up to $7.3 million to Computer
Motion. Computer Motion may use the facility to pay off existing
indebtedness and to fund operations prior to completion of the
merger. The facility will terminate and all outstanding amounts
thereunder will become due and payable 120 days following
termination of the merger agreement, subject to specified
acceleration events. Interest on the facility will be payable at
a rate equal to 8% per year and is not due and payable until the
maturity date. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus,
$                    million
is outstanding under this facility.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers
of Computer Motion in the Merger

When considering the Computer Motion board of
directors recommendation that the Computer Motion
stockholders vote 
FOR 
the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement, Computer Motion stockholders
should be aware that some directors and executive officers of
Computer Motion may have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Computer
Motion stockholders.

The Computer Motion board of directors knew about
these additional interests, and considered them, among other
matters, when it approved the merger agreement. These interests
include the following:

 

the employment of Joseph M. DeVivo as Senior
    Vice President, Marketing of Intuitive Surgical upon completion
    of the merger;

 

the employment of Darrin R. Uecker as Vice
    President and Chief Technical Officer of Intuitive Surgical upon
    completion of the merger;

 

the appointment of Robert W. Duggan and
    Eric H. Halvorson to serve as members of Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors;

 

approximately 82% of the stock options held by
    Computer Motion executive officers and directors will accelerate
    upon completion of the merger and all stock options will be
    assumed by Intuitive Surgical in connection with the merger;

 

indemnification provided to the present and
    former executive officers and directors of Computer Motion;

 

Series C convertible preferred stock of
    Computer Motion held by, among others,



Mr. Duggan, Mr. DeVivo and an
    investment fund affiliated with Robert W. Lautz, a former
    director of Computer Motion, was exchanged for newly-issued
    Series D convertible preferred stock having revised
    conversion rights in connection with the merger;

 

the reduction in the exercise prices of certain
    outstanding warrants to purchase Computer Motion common stock
    originally issued to investors in Computer Motions
    Series C convertible preferred stock financing, including
    Mr. Duggan, Mr. DeVivo and an investment fund
    affiliated with Mr. Lautz, to induce the Series C
    investors to exchange their shares for newly issued
    Series D convertible preferred stock; and

 

a cash payment to be received prior to the
    effective time of the merger by the investment fund affiliated
    with Mr. Lautz to induce the investment fund to exchange
    its shares for newly issued Series D convertible preferred
    stock.

Listing of Intuitive Surgical Common Stock and
Delisting of Computer Motion Common Stock

Application will be made to have the Intuitive
Surgical common stock issued in connection with the merger
approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, where
Intuitive Surgical common stock currently is traded under the
symbol ISRG. If the merger is completed, Computer
Motion common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq
National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Computer Motion will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC.

Appraisal Rights

Neither Intuitive Surgical stockholders nor
Computer Motion stockholders will have appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.

Conditions to Completion of the
Merger

In order to complete the merger, we must satisfy
a number of conditions, including but not limited to the
following:

 

the registration statement of which this joint
    proxy statement/prospectus forms a part must have been declared
    effective by the SEC and must not be the subject of any stop
    order or related proceedings;

 

Computer Motion stockholders must approve the
    proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement;

 

Intuitive Surgicals stockholders must
    approve the proposal to issue Intuitive Surgical common stock
    pursuant to the merger agreement;

 

the shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock
    issuable in the merger must be approved for listing on Nasdaq;

 

there must be no material adverse change to
    Computer Motions business that arises out of or relates to
    Computer Motions intellectual property or capitalization
    or the incurrence by Computer Motion of any liability or
    obligation; and

 

each of the patent litigation stays remain in
    full force and effect.

No Solicitation by Computer Motion

The merger agreement contains detailed provisions
restricting Computer Motion from seeking an alternative
transaction with another party. These no
solicitation provisions prohibit Computer Motion, as well
as its officers, directors, subsidiaries and representatives,
from taking any action to solicit an acquisition proposal from
another party. The merger agreement does not, however, prohibit
Computer Motion or its board of directors from considering, and
potentially recommending, an unsolicited bona fide superior
written proposal under limited circumstances.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion can
jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at any given
time. Either company may also terminate the merger agreement if
the merger is not completed by August 31, 2003 and under
other circumstances described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Termination Fee and Expenses

The merger agreement provides that, under
specified circumstances, Intuitive Surgical or Computer Motion
may be required to pay a termination fee and expenses of the
other party in an aggregate amount of up to $2.5 million.



Computer Motion Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock

All shares of Computer Motion Series D
convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of Computer
Motion common stock immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger. The Computer Motion common stock then will be
exchanged for Intuitive Surgical common stock based on the
exchange ratio in the merger. The regular conversion ratio under
the Series D convertible preferred stock is fixed at
approximately 1,014.5 to 1. However, in connection with the
merger, the Series D stockholders may elect to convert
their shares at a floating conversion ratio that would return at
least 135% of the original purchase price of the shares (based
on the value of Computer Motion common stock during a specified
period prior to the effective time of the merger). However, this
floating conversion ratio cannot exceed 135% of the regular
conversion ratio.

Each Series D stockholder must elect the
alternative conversion ratio by delivering a notice to Computer
Motion no later than 12 trading days prior to the date of
the special meeting. The shares held by any holder who does not
make such election will convert into Computer Motion common
stock at the regular conversion ratio immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger.

Computer Motion Stock Options and
Warrants

At the effective time of the merger, each option
or warrant to purchase shares of Computer Motion common stock
outstanding immediately before the effective time will be
assumed by Intuitive Surgical and converted into and become a
right to purchase shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock.
Each option or warrant assumed by Intuitive Surgical will be
exercisable for the number of shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock equal to the number of shares of Computer Motion
common stock issuable upon exercise of the option or warrant
multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share. The per share exercise price for each option or
warrant will be the exercise price of each Computer Motion
option or warrant divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. Pursuant to their terms, the vesting of
substantially all of Computer Motions outstanding options
will accelerate upon completion of the merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger

Computer Motion expects the merger to be treated
as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Assuming that the merger qualifies as a tax-free
reorganization, then, in general, Computer Motion stockholders
will not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange of their
shares of Computer Motion common stock for shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger, except for gain or
loss on fractional shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock for
which cash is received. No gain or loss will be recognized by
Intuitive Surgical stockholders as a result of the merger.

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax
consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of
your own situation. For a more complete description of the tax
consequences of the merger, see The Merger 
Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences. We
encourage you to consult your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Accounting Treatment

Intuitive Surgical will account for the merger
under the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations under United States generally accepted accounting
principles.

Regulatory Approvals

Neither Intuitive Surgical nor Computer Motion is
aware of any material federal or state regulatory requirements
or approvals required for completion of the merger.

Additional Proposals to be Considered by
Intuitive Surgical Stockholders

In addition to the proposal to issue shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement, Intuitive Surgical stockholders will be asked

 

to approve an amendment to Intuitive
    Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation to effect a 1-for-2 reverse stock split;

 

to elect three members of Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors;



 

to approve an amendment to Intuitive
    Surgicals 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan to
    increase the annual stock option grant for non- employee
    directors from 5,000 to 10,000 shares, to provide for an
    additional annual grant of options to purchase 5,000 shares to
    committee chairs and to amend the automatic share increase
    provision, subject to adjustment in the event that the proposed
    reverse stock split is approved by Intuitive Surgicals
    stockholders and implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board
    of directors; and

 

to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP
    as Intuitive Surgicals independent auditors for the
    current fiscal year ending December 31, 2003.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
unanimously recommends that Intuitive Surgical stockholders vote

FOR
 each of these proposals (other than the
election of directors) and 
FOR 
the election
of the nominees to the board of directors listed in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus contains important information about each
of these proposals.

The historical net book value per share of
    Intuitive Surgical common stock and Computer Motion common stock
    is computed by dividing common stockholders equity at
    period end by the number of shares of common stock outstanding
    at the respective period end. The pro forma net book value per
    combined companys share is computed by dividing the pro
    forma common stockholders equity by the pro forma number
    of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock outstanding at the
    respective period end, assuming the merger had been completed on
    that date.

(2) 

The pro forma loss and net book value per
    equivalent Computer Motion share is calculated by multiplying
    the pro forma combined amounts by an estimated exchange ratio of
    0.52 for each share of Computer Motion common stock. The
    estimated exchange ratio (a) is based on a number of
    assumptions, (b) may be different from the final exchange
    ratio and (c) will be adjusted proportionately in the event
    that the proposed reverse split of Intuitive Surgicals
    common stock is approved by Intuitive Surgicals
    stockholders and implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board
    of directors. Please see The Merger Agreement 
    The Merger Consideration and Conversion of Securities.

On March 6, 2003, the last trading day
before we announced the merger, the closing price of Intuitive
Surgical common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $4.42
per share and the closing price of Computer Motion common stock
on the Nasdaq National Market was $1.65 per share. Based on an
estimated exchange ratio of approximately 0.52 shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock for each outstanding share of
Computer Motion common stock and the closing price of Intuitive
Surgical common stock on March 6, 2003, the pro forma
equivalent per share value of Computer Motion common stock on
March 6, 2003 was approximately $2.30 per share.

On                     ,
2003, the last trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus, the closing price of Intuitive Surgical
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was
$          ,
the closing price of Computer Motion common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was
$          and
the pro forma equivalent per share value of Computer Motion
common stock, based on an estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52 and the closing price of Intuitive Surgical
common stock
on           ,
2003, was approximately
$          per
share.

The market value of the shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock that will be issued in exchange for shares
of Computer Motion common stock upon completion of the merger
will not be known at the time Computer Motion stockholders vote
on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, or at
the time Intuitive Surgical stockholders vote on the proposal to
issue shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement, because the merger will not have been
completed by then.

The above table shows only historical
comparisons. Because the market prices of Intuitive Surgical
common stock and Computer Motion common stock will likely
fluctuate prior to completion of the merger, these comparisons
may not provide meaningful information to Intuitive Surgical
stockholders in determining whether to approve the proposal to
issue shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement or to Computer Motion stockholders in
determining whether to approve the proposal to approve and adopt
the merger agreement. Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations
for Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion common stock and to
review carefully the other information contained in this joint
proxy statement/ prospectus or incorporated by reference into
this joint proxy statement/ prospectus in considering whether to
approve these proposals. Please see the section entitled
Where You Can Find More Information.



RISK FACTORS

The merger involves a high degree of risk for
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion stockholders. Computer
Motion stockholders will be choosing to invest in Intuitive
Surgical common stock by voting in favor of approval of the
merger agreement. An investment in shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the
other information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Statements, you should carefully consider the following
risks before deciding whether to vote for approval and adoption
of the merger agreement, in the case of Computer Motion
stockholders, or for the issuance of shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock in the merger, in the case of Intuitive
Surgical stockholders. In addition, you should read and consider
the risks associated with each of the businesses of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion because these risks will also
affect the combined company. These risks can be found in
Intuitive Surgicals Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2002 and in Computer
Motions Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Each of these reports is filed with the
SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known to Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion or
that are not currently believed to be important to you also may
adversely affect the merger and the combined company following
the merger.

Risks Related to the Merger

The exchange ratio with respect to holders
    of shares of Computer Motion common stock could decrease in the
    event that the average sales price of Computer Motion common
    stock is below $1.86 per share during a specified period
    prior to the Computer Motion special meeting.

The fraction of a share of Intuitive Surgical
common stock into which each share of Computer Motion common
stock will be converted, or the exchange ratio, will be
determined based on the total number of fully diluted shares
outstanding for Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The
number of Computer Motions fully diluted shares will vary
based on the number of shares of Computer Motion common stock
into which Computer Motions preferred stock will be
convertible and the number of shares of Computer Motion common
stock which may be issued to pay accrued dividends on the
Series D convertible preferred stock upon conversion. All
shares of Computer Motion preferred stock will convert into
shares of Computer Motion common stock immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. Under the terms of the preferred
stock, in the event that the average of the closing bid prices
of Computer Motion common stock for the 20 consecutive trading
days ending 15 days prior to the Computer Motion special
meeting (which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the pricing period) is below
$1.86 per share, the conversion ratio for Computer
Motions preferred stock could increase. As a result, the
exchange ratio with respect to holders of shares of Computer
Motion common stock may decrease. If this were to occur, the
holders of Computer Motion common stock would receive less than
the estimated 0.52 shares of Intuitive Surgical common
stock for each share of Computer Motion common stock they own.
This adjustment would have no effect on stockholders of
Intuitive Surgical, who would maintain the same proportionate
ownership interest in the combined company. We do not know
whether such an adjustment will be required. The anticipated
exchange ratio for Computer Motion common stock, based on the
number of fully diluted shares of Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion expected to be outstanding on an assumed closing
date of June 20, 2003, will range from approximately 0.48
to 0.52 depending on the average of the closing bid prices of
Computer Motion common stock during the pricing period.

The number of shares of Intuitive Surgical
    common stock to be issued to Computer Motion stockholders will
    not be adjusted for possible fluctuations in the value of
    Intuitive Surgical common stock.

As a result of Computer Motion stockholders
receiving the merger consideration in the form of shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock, the value of the merger
consideration to be received by Computer Motion stockholders
will depend on the market price of Intuitive Surgical common
stock at the time the



merger is completed. The market price of
Intuitive Surgical common stock at the closing of the merger may
vary from its market prices at the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and at the date of the Intuitive Surgical
and Computer Motion stockholder meetings. These variations may
be caused by a number of factors, including changes in the
businesses, operations or prospects of Intuitive Surgical or
Computer Motion, the timing of the merger and general market and
economic conditions. Neither the exchange ratio nor the merger
consideration will be adjusted for any increase or decrease in
the market price of Intuitive Surgical common stock.
Accordingly, if the market price of Intuitive Surgical common
stock declines prior to the time the merger is completed, the
value of the merger consideration to be received by Computer
Motion stockholders will decline.

In addition, because the merger will be completed
after the special meetings, Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion stockholders will not know the exact value of the
Intuitive Surgical common stock that will be issued in
connection with the merger at the time they vote on the merger
proposals. We encourage you to obtain current market quotations
for Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion shares before you
vote your shares.

The issuance of shares of Intuitive
    Surgical common stock to Computer Motion stockholders in the
    merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of
    Intuitive Surgical stockholders.

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and, upon completion of the merger, current Intuitive
Surgical stockholders will own approximately 72% of the then
outstanding shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock and former
Computer Motion stockholders will own approximately 28% of the
then outstanding shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock.

In addition, based on the estimated exchange
ratio of approximately 0.52, we estimate that Intuitive Surgical
will reserve approximately 5.7 million shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock for future issuance in connection with
Intuitive Surgicals assumption of Computer Motions
outstanding options and warrants (including out-of-the-money
options and warrants), subject to proportionate reduction in the
event that the proposed reverse stock split is approved by
Intuitive Surgicals stockholders and implemented by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors. The outstanding
warrants of Computer Motion have a range of exercise prices.
Holders of these warrants have the right to an adjustment in the
exercise price of their warrants, and in some cases in the
number of shares issuable upon exercise, if the warrant issuer
sells shares in the future at prices below the exercise prices
of the warrants. These anti-dilution protections may continue to
apply after the merger and thus could result in additional
dilution to stockholders of the combined company as we make
future offerings of capital stock.

The issuance of shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock to former Computer Motion stockholders in or after
the merger will cause a significant reduction in the relative
percentage interests of current Intuitive Surgical stockholders
in earnings, voting, liquidation value and book and market
value. The issuance of additional shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock in future transactions could also reduce the
percentage interests of former Computer Motion stockholders and
Intuitive Surgical stockholders in the combined company. This
dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock.

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion each
    have incurred substantial losses since inception, expect to
    incur further losses, and may not be able to generate or raise
    sufficient cash to fund their operations, separate or
    combined.

Intuitive Surgical incurred a net loss of
$18.4 million for 2002, and Computer Motion incurred a net
loss of $21.2 million for the same period. The extent of
our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly
uncertain, and we may never achieve profitable operations. If
the time required to generate significant revenues and achieve
profitability is longer than anticipated, we may not be able to
continue our operations. In recent periods, Computer Motion has
not generated cash from operations. Both companies expect to
incur additional operating losses into 2003, and both companies
have substantial cash needs.



Among other things, total fees and costs of both
companies associated with the merger are currently projected to
be approximately $4.0 million. Intuitive Surgical has
agreed to fund up to $7.3 million of Computer Motions
working capital needs through the effective time of the merger
under the Loan and Security Agreement. Assuming completion of
the merger on or around June 20, 2003, we project that the
total combined cash and cash equivalents of the two companies
will be less than $35.0 million. We expect that the capital
resources of the combined company, together with revenue derived
from product sales, will be sufficient to meet the combined
companys working capital needs at least through 2003.
After that, we may need to raise additional funds. We may not be
able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at
all. If we are unable to generate sufficient capital to fund our
operations and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not
be able to further develop, enhance or expand the market for our
products and services, and the combined company could fail.

The combined company may not realize all of
    the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The success of the merger will depend, in part,
on the ability of the combined company to realize the
anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities
from integrating the business of Computer Motion with the
business of Intuitive Surgical. Intuitive Surgicals
success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this
realization depend upon the successful, rapid integration of the
operations of Computer Motion with those of Intuitive Surgical.
This integration will be a complex, costly and time-consuming
process and may not succeed as planned. The difficulties of
combining the operations of the companies include, among other
things:

 

coordinating and consolidating ongoing and future
    research and development efforts;

 

consolidating sales and marketing operations;

 

retaining existing customers and attracting new
    customers;

 

retaining strategic partners and attracting new
    strategic partners;

 

retaining key employees;

 

consolidating corporate and administrative
    infrastructures;

 

integrating and managing the technologies and
    products of the two companies;

 

identifying and eliminating redundant and
    underperforming operations and assets;

 

using capital assets efficiently to develop the
    business of the combined company;

 

minimizing the diversion of managements
    attention from ongoing business concerns; and

 

coordinating geographically separate
    organizations.

In addition, Computer Motions products
differ in substantial ways from Intuitive Surgicals
products, and the companies rely on different distributors and
sales channels to sell their products. Both Intuitive Surgical
and Computer Motion are parties to existing distribution
agreements that cannot be terminated prior to the end of their
terms.

We do not know whether the combined company will
succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems
encountered in connection with the merger, or whether the
integration of Computer Motion with Intuitive Surgical will
result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us
from the merger.



Failure to complete the merger could
    negatively impact both Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
    and their stockholders.

If the merger is not completed for any reason,
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion and their stockholders
will be subject to a number of material risks, including:

 

the provision in the merger agreement that, under
    specified circumstances, either Intuitive Surgical or Computer
    Motion could be required to pay the other a termination fee and
    expenses of up to an aggregate of $2.5 million;

 

the litigations between the two companies may
    resume;

 

Computer Motion would be required to repay to
    Intuitive Surgical all amounts loaned under the bridge loan
    facility within 120 days following termination of the
    merger agreement;

 

Computer Motion likely would not have sufficient
    cash to repay amounts loaned under the bridge loan, and
    Intuitive Surgical would be at risk that such bridge loan
    amounts would not be repaid unless Computer Motion were able to
    obtain alternative financing;

 

the market price of Intuitive Surgical common
    stock and Computer Motion common stock may decline to the extent
    that the current market price of such shares reflects a market
    assumption that the merger will be completed;

 

costs related to the merger, such as legal and
    accounting fees, must be paid even if the merger is not
    completed;

 

benefits that Intuitive Surgical and Computer
    Motion expect to realize from the merger would not be realized;
    and

 

the diversion of management attention from the
    day-to-day businesses of the companies, and the unavoidable
    disruption to their employees and customers during the period
    before completion of the merger may make it difficult for
    Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion to regain their financial
    and market positions if the merger does not occur.

In addition, since entering into the merger
agreement on March 7, 2003, Computer Motion has made
planning and operations decisions on the basis that the merger
will be completed. These planning and operations decisions may
have been different had Computer Motion not entered into the
merger agreement. For example, if Computer Motion had not
entered into the merger agreement, it may have pursued a debt or
equity financing transaction in order to assure access to
sufficient working capital as an independent company, rather
than rely on the availability of Intuitive Surgicals cash
assuming the merger will be completed. Moreover, the merger
agreement contains restrictions on Computer Motions
incurrence of debt and issuance of equity securities while the
merger is pending. If the merger is not completed, not only will
Computer Motion not have the benefit of Intuitive
Surgicals cash or have obtained other financing, but
Computer Motion also will have incurred a significant amount of
non-operating expenses associated with the merger that it
otherwise would not have incurred. Consequently, if the merger
is not completed, Computer Motions financial condition
likely will be worse than it would have been had it never
entered into the merger agreement.

If Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical fail to
complete the merger, Computer Motion will face the difficulties
of competing with limited cash resources and will need to
attempt to raise additional debt or equity capital. Such
financing may be available only on terms materially adverse to
Computer Motion, and may not be available at all.

Additionally, if the merger is not completed,
Computer Motions stock would no longer be influenced by
the exchange ratio established by the merger agreement, which
could negatively impact Computer Motions current market
valuation and stock price.



Sales by Intuitive Surgical stockholders or
    former Computer Motion stockholders could cause Intuitive
    Surgicals common stock price to decline.

The market price of Intuitive Surgical common
stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of
shares in the market. These sales may also make it more
difficult for the combined company to sell equity securities in
the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate to
raise funds through future offerings of common stock. As of
December 31, 2002, several entities beneficially owned more
than 5% of the outstanding shares of Intuitive Surgicals
common stock, including Bear Stearns Asset Management,
Allan G. Lozier, Investor Growth Capital, Ltd., Merrill
Lynch & Co., and PaTMarK Company, Inc. Assuming that
the merger is completed, the former stockholders of Computer
Motion will own approximately 28% of the combined company,
subject to the assumptions and adjustments discussed elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, holders
of warrants to purchase up to 5.5 million shares of
Computer Motion common stock will receive Intuitive Surgical
warrants in exchange for their Computer Motion warrants in
connection with the merger. Such warrant holders will have the
right to include their shares in resale registration statements
that we will be obligated to file on their behalf.

Directors and officers of Computer Motion
    have potential conflicts of interest that may have influenced
    them to recommend the merger.

Some of the directors of Computer Motion who
recommend that you vote in favor of the merger and the officers
of Computer Motion who provided information to their board of
directors relating to the merger have employment,
indemnification and severance benefit arrangements, significant
ownership interests and rights to acceleration of stock options
that provide them with interests in the merger that may differ
from yours. The receipt of compensation or other benefits in the
merger may have influenced (1) these directors in making
their recommendation that you vote in favor of the transactions
called for by the merger agreement and (2) these officers
in making recommendations to their board of directors relating
to the merger. See The Merger  Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers of Computer Motion in the
Merger.

Customer, supplier and employee uncertainty
    related to the merger could harm the combined
    company.

Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion customers
and suppliers may, in response to the announcement or completion
of the merger, delay purchasing or supply decisions or otherwise
alter existing relationships with Intuitive Surgical or Computer
Motion. These decisions or other adverse changes in the business
relationships of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion with
their respective customers and suppliers could adversely affect
the business of the combined company. Similarly, current and
prospective Computer Motion employees may experience uncertainty
about their future as employees of the combined company until
strategies with regard to Computer Motion are announced or
executed. This may adversely affect Intuitive Surgicals or
Computer Motions ability to attract and retain, and may
affect the performance during the transition period of, key
management, sales, marketing and technical personnel.

Risks Related to Computer Motions
Engagement of Arthur Andersen LLP as its Auditors

Computer Motion has not obtained the
    consent of Arthur Andersen LLP to be named in this joint proxy
    statement/prospectus as having audited the Computer Motion
    financial statements. This will limit your ability to assert
    claims against Arthur Andersen.

After reasonable efforts, Computer Motion has
been unable to obtain the consent of Arthur Andersen LLP to the
incorporation into the registration statement, of which this
joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, of their report
with respect to the consolidated financial statements of
Computer Motion for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 which appear in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Under
these circumstances, Rule 437(a) under the Securities Act
of 1933 permits the registration statement to be filed without a
written consent from Arthur Andersen. The absence of such
consent may limit your recovery on certain claims. In
particular, and



without limitation, you will not be able to
assert claims against Arthur Andersen under Section 11 of
the Securities Act of 1933 for any untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the consolidated financial statements
of Computer Motion for the years ended December 31, 2001
and December 31, 2000 which appear in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, or any
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein.

The conviction of Arthur Andersen LLP on
    obstruction of justice charges may adversely affect Arthur
    Andersens ability to satisfy claims arising from the
    provision of auditing services to Computer Motion and may impede
    the combined companys access to capital markets after the
    merger.

Arthur Andersen LLP audited Computer
Motions financial statements incorporated by reference in
the registration statement, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. On
March 14, 2002, an indictment was unsealed charging Arthur
Andersen with federal obstruction of justice arising from the
governments investigation of Enron Corp. On June 15,
2002, Arthur Andersen was convicted of these charges. The impact
of this conviction on Arthur Andersens financial condition
may adversely affect the ability of Arthur Andersen to satisfy
any claims arising from its provision of auditing services to
Computer Motion.

Should Intuitive Surgical seek to access the
public capital markets after completion of the merger, SEC rules
will require Intuitive Surgical to include or incorporate by
reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial
statements. The SECs current rules would require Intuitive
Surgical to present audited financial statements for one or more
fiscal years audited by Arthur Andersen and use reasonable
efforts to obtain its consent until the audited financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004
become available. If prior to that time the SEC ceases accepting
financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen, it is possible
that the available audited financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 audited
by Arthur Andersen might not satisfy the SECs
requirements. In that case, Intuitive Surgical would be unable
to access the public capital markets unless an independent
accounting firm is able to audit the financial statements
originally audited by Arthur Andersen. Any delay or inability to
access the public capital markets caused by these circumstances
could have a material adverse effect on the combined
companys business, profitability and growth prospects.

Risks Related to Intuitive Surgical and the
Combined Company

As used below, we or
us refers to Intuitive Surgical or the combined
company after the merger, as the context requires.

Our future operating results may be below
    securities analysts or investors expectations, which
    could cause our stock price to decline.

Because of our limited operating history, we have
limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and
affect our business. The revenue and income potential of our
market are unproven, and we may be unable to generate
significant revenues. In addition, our costs may be higher than
we, securities analysts or investors expect. If we fail to
generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we
expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn
could cause our stock price to decline. Further, future revenue
from sales of our products is difficult to forecast because the
market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our
results of operations will depend upon numerous factors,
including:

 

the progress and results of clinical trials;

 

actions relating to regulatory matters;

 

the extent to which our products gain market
    acceptance;

 

our timing and ability to develop our
    manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities;

 

demand for our products;

 

the progress of surgical training in the use of
    our products;



 

our ability to develop, introduce and market new
    or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;

 

product quality problems;

 

our ability to protect our proprietary rights and
    defend against third party challenges;

 

our ability to license additional intellectual
    property rights; and

 

third-party payor reimbursement policies.

Our operating results in any particular period
will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. It
is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results
will be below the expectations of securities analysts or
investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock, and
the value of your investment, will likely decline.

We experience long and variable sales
    cycles, which could have a negative impact on our results of
    operations for any given quarter.

Our 
da Vinci 
Surgical System has a lengthy
sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital
item and generally requires the approval of senior management at
purchasing institutions. These factors may contribute to
substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results,
particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is
low. Because of these fluctuations, it is likely that in some
future quarters our operating results will fall below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that
happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease.
These fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely
upon our operating results in any particular period as an
indication of future performance.

Because a small number of customers have
    and are likely to continue to account for a substantial portion
    of our revenues, our revenues could decline due to the loss or
    delay of a single customer.

A relatively small number of customers account
for a significant portion of our total revenues. In 2000, 2001
and 2002, the majority of our revenues came from the sales of

da Vinci 
Surgical Systems, which are high revenue dollar
items. Due to the high dollar revenue per system sold, small
variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary
significantly from quarter to quarter. For 2001, AB Medica SRL,
our Italian distributor, accounted for 15% of total sales. No
customer accounted for more than 10% of sales during 2000 or
2002.

Due to the high average selling price of the of

da Vinci 
Surgical System, our failure to add new
customers that make significant purchases of our products could
reduce our future revenues. The loss or delay of individual
orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating
results.

If our products do not achieve market
    acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue
    necessary to support our business.

Our products represent a fundamentally new way of
performing surgery. Achieving physician, patient and third-party
payor acceptance of 
Intuitive
 surgery as a preferred
method of performing surgery will be crucial to our success. If
our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospitals will
not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate
the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that
physicians and third-party payors acceptance of the
benefits of procedures performed using our products will be
essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians
will not recommend the use of our products unless we can
demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to
existing surgical techniques. Even if we can prove the
effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, surgeons
may elect not to use our products for any number of other
reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend
conventional open heart surgery simply because such surgery is
already so widely accepted. In addition, surgeons may be slow to
adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks
arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of
reimbursement from third-party payors.



We expect that there will be a learning process
involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of
our products. Broad use of our products will require training of
surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time
required to complete this training. We may not be able to
rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate
adequate demand for our products. We cannot be certain that our
training programs will be cost effective or sufficient to meet
our customers needs.

We are involved in intellectual property
    litigation with Computer Motion and Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC
    that may hurt our competitive position, may be costly to us and
    may prevent us from selling our products. While the merger
    agreement has resulted in a stay of all proceedings involving
    Computer Motion, these proceedings may continue if the merger is
    not completed.

On May 10, 2000, Computer Motion filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California (Case No. CV00-4988 CBM) alleging
that by making, using, selling or offering for sale our 
da
Vinci 
Surgical System, we are infringing United States
Patent Numbers 5,524,180, 5,762,458, 5,815,640, 5,855,583,
5,878,193, 5,907,664 and 6,001,108, in willful disregard of
Computer Motions patent rights. On June 1, 2000,
Computer Motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also
infringe U.S. Patent Number 6,063,095. In late 2000, Computer
Motion alleged our infringement of a ninth patent, and added
U.S. Patent Number 6,102,850 to the litigation. Computer
Motion subsequently alleged that we infringed U.S. Patent
No. 6,244,809, which it added to the litigation in May
2002. These ten patents concern various methods and devices for
conducting various aspects of robotic surgery. Of those ten
patents, three are no longer part of the suit. After Computer
Motion lost all of its rights to its 5,855,583 and 5,878,193
patents as a result of our successful Patent Office interference
proceedings Computer Motion voluntarily dismissed those patents
from suit. However, Computer Motion has sought to challenge the
interference proceedings by separate district court appeal. In
addition, in November 2002, the Court granted our motion for
summary judgment of noninfringement of the 6,102,850 patent. In
February 2003, the Court denied our motion for summary judgment
of noninfringement of the 6,244,809 patent and granted Computer
Motions cross-motion for partial summary judgment of
literal infringement of one claim of that patent. We
subsequently requested that the Court reconsider that decision
because of perceived flaws in the Courts approach to the
issue of infringement on summary judgment. Regardless of what
happens on reconsideration, we will continue to defend the 809
patent on invalidity, based on the earlier robotic surgery work
of SRI and others. We still have pending motions for summary
judgment of noninfringement on two more of Computer
Motions seven remaining patents-in-suit, numbers 5,907,664
and 6,001,108. At the Courts request, we will not file
further motions for summary judgment until the remaining pending
motions are decided. In late January 2003, after close of fact
discovery, Computer Motion asserted between 26 and 35 new claims
of its seven remaining patents-in-suit and new theories of
infringement. We have moved to strike those new assertions as
inappropriate at this late stage. Trial had been calendared for
April 29, 2003.

In connection with our proposed merger with
Computer Motion, our company and Computer Motion have obtained
an immediate stay through August 31, 2003 of all
proceedings in the pending litigations between the companies. As
part of the stays, the courts have ceased all further activity
in the cases during the period of stays and will not issue any
opinions or orders on issues already submitted for decision. In
addition, the California Court postponed the trial date and was
asked to reset trial for a date no earlier than
November 30, 2003. The stays may be terminated before, or
extended beyond, August 31, 2003 under specified
circumstances. In the event the merger is completed, Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion will request dismissal with
prejudice of all pending litigations.

If the merger is not completed by August 31,
2003, the stays may be lifted and the California Case may
proceed to trial. If the stays are lifted and Intuitive Surgical
ultimately loses the lawsuit with Computer Motion, it will hurt
Intuitive Surgicals competitive position, may be costly to
Intuitive Surgical and may prevent Intuitive Surgical from
selling its products. In addition, Intuitive Surgical may need
to obtain from Computer Motion a license to this technology if
Intuitive Surgical is to continue to market its products that
have been found to infringe Computer Motions patents. This
license could be expensive, or could require Intuitive Surgical
to license to Computer Motion some of its technology, which
would result



in a partial loss of Intuitive Surgicals
competitive advantage in the marketplace, each of which could
seriously harm Intuitive Surgicals business. If the stays
are lifted and Computer Motion is successful in its suit against
Intuitive Surgical and is unwilling to grant Intuitive Surgical
a license, Intuitive Surgical may be required to stop selling
its products that are found to infringe Computer Motions
patents unless Intuitive Surgical can redesign them so they do
not infringe Computer Motions patents, which Intuitive
Surgical may be unable to do. In addition, Intuitive Surgical
could be required to pay Computer Motion damages, including
treble damages, which could be substantial and harm Intuitive
Surgicals financial position.

On September 1, 2000, Brookhill-Wilk 1,
LLC, or Wilk, filed a lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 00
Civ. 6599 (NRB)) alleging that by making, using, selling or
offering for sale our 
da Vinci 
Surgical System, we are
infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 5,217,003 and 5,368,015 in
willful disregard of Wilks patent rights. These patents
concern methods and devices for remote surgery. In
March 2001, Wilk withdrew its assertion of the 015 patent
against our company. On November 8, 2001, the District
Court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the 003
patent in our favor and dismissed Wilks complaint in its
entirety without prejudice. Wilk appealed the summary judgment
ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A
decision on the merits of the appeal is expected sometime in
2003. If we lose on appeal and ultimately also lose Wilks
suit against us, it will hurt our competitive position, may be
costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products. If we
lose the patent suit, we may need to obtain from Wilk a license
to this technology if we are to continue to market our products
that have been found to infringe Wilks patents. This
license could be expensive, which could seriously harm our
business. If Wilk is successful in its suit against us and is
unwilling to grant us a license, we may be required to stop
selling our products that are found to infringe Wilks
patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe
Wilks patents, which we may be unable to do. In addition,
we could be required to pay Wilk damages, including treble
damages, which could be substantial and harm our financial
position.

On February 21, 2001, Wilk filed suit
against Computer Motion alleging that its ZEUS surgical system
infringed upon Wilks U.S. Patent Nos. 5,217,003
and 5,368,015. Wilks complaint sought damages,
attorneys fees and increased damages alleging willful
patent infringement. On March 21, 2001, Computer Motion
served its answer and counterclaim alleging non-infringement of
each patent-in-suit, patent invalidity and unenforceability. On
November 8, 2001, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York in the co-pending Brookhill-Wilk
v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Civil Action No. 00-CV-6599
(NRB), issued an order interpreting the claims of Wilks
U.S. Patent No. 5,217,003 in a way that Computer
Motion believed excluded current applications of its ZEUS
surgical system. In light of this decision, on November 13,
2001, Wilk and Computer Motion agreed to dismiss the case
without prejudice to refiling upon resolution of the appeal in
Wilks litigation against Intuitive Surgical.

The foregoing proceedings would be expensive to
litigate, may be protracted and our confidential information may
be compromised. Whether or not we are successful in these
lawsuits, these proceedings could consume substantial amounts of
our financial and managerial resources. At any time the other
parties may file additional claims against our company, or we
may file claims against them, which could increase the risk,
expense and duration of the litigations.

If we are unable to protect the
    intellectual property contained in our products from use by
    third parties, our ability to compete in the market will be
    harmed.

Our commercial success will depend in part on
obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for
the technologies contained in our products, and on successfully
defending our patents and other intellectual property against
third party challenges.

We will incur substantial costs in obtaining
patents and, if necessary, defending our proprietary rights. The
patent positions of medical device companies, including ours,
can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal
and factual questions. We do not know whether we will obtain the
patent protection we seek, or that the protection we do obtain
will be found valid and enforceable if challenged.



We also do not know whether we will be able to
develop additional patentable proprietary technologies. If we
fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property,
or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others
could use our intellectual property without compensating us,
resulting in harm to our business. We may also determine that it
is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third
partys products or patents in litigation or administrative
proceedings, including patent interferences or reexaminations.
In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not
protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do
the laws of the United States.

Others may assert that our products
    infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us
    to engage in costly disputes and, if we are not successful in
    defending ourselves, could also cause us to pay substantial
    damages and prohibit us from selling our products.

We are aware of both United States and foreign
patents issued to third parties that relate to computer-assisted
surgery, remote surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Some of
these patents on their face appear broad enough to cover one or
more aspects of our present technology, and may cover aspects of
our future technology. We do not know whether any of these
patents, if challenged, would be held valid, enforceable and
infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely will
continue to receive, letters from third parties inviting us to
license their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in
an administrative proceeding with, one or more of these third
parties. We cannot assure you that a court or administrative
body would agree with any arguments or defenses we have
concerning invalidity, unenforceability or noninfringement of
any third-party patent. In addition to the issued patents of
which we are aware, other parties may have filed, and in the
future are likely to file, patent applications covering surgical
products that are similar or identical to ours. We cannot assure
you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third
party will not cover our products or will not have priority over
our patent applications.

The medical device industry has been
characterized by extensive litigation and administrative
proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property
rights, and companies have employed such actions to gain a
competitive advantage. If third parties assert infringement or
other intellectual property claims against us as Computer Motion
and Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC have done, our technical and
management personnel will experience a significant diversion of
time and effort and we will incur large expenses defending our
Company. If third parties in any patent action are successful,
our patent portfolio may be damaged, we may have to pay
substantial damages, including treble damages, and we may be
required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which,
if available at all, may require us to pay substantial
royalties. We cannot be certain that we will have the financial
resources or the substantive arguments to defend our patents
from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability,
or to defend against allegations of infringement of third-party
patents. In addition, any public announcements related to
litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us, or
initiated or threatened against us, could cause our stock price
to decline.

The rights and measures we rely on to
    protect the intellectual property underlying our products may
    not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our
    technology, which could harm our ability to compete in the
    market.

In addition to patents, we typically rely on a
combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws,
nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and
technical security measures to protect our intellectual property
rights. Nevertheless, these measures may not be adequate to
safeguard the technology underlying our products. If they do not
protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our
technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be
reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who
participate in developing our products may breach their
agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we
may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not
be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights
in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may
decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection
outside the United States. We also realize that our trade
secrets may become known through other means not currently
foreseen by



us. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our
intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop
similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal
or superior to our technology and products without infringing
any of our intellectual property rights, or may design around
our proprietary technologies.

Our products rely on licenses from third
    parties, and if we lose access to these technologies, our
    revenues could decline.

We rely on technology that we license from
others, including technology that is integral to our products.
We have entered into license agreements with SRI International,
IBM Corporation, MIT, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., and Heartport,
Inc., now part of Johnson & Johnson. Any of these agreements
may be terminated for breach. If any of these agreements is
terminated, we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license
on satisfactory terms, or at all. The loss or failure to
maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further
development or commercialization of our products.

Public announcements of litigation events
    may cause our stock price to decline.

During the course of our administrative
proceedings and/or lawsuits, there may be public announcements
of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim
proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities
analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it
could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of
our stock.

Our products are subject to a lengthy and
    uncertain domestic regulatory process. If we do not obtain and
    maintain the necessary domestic regulatory approvals, we will
    not be able to market and sell our products in the United
    States.

Our products and operations are subject to
extensive regulation in the United States by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, or FDA. The FDA regulates the research,
testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record
keeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical
devices in the United States to ensure that medical products
distributed domestically are safe and effective for their
intended uses. In order for us to market certain products for
use in the United States, we generally must first obtain
clearance from the FDA, pursuant to Section 510(k) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. Clearance under
Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is
substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device. If
we modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, the FDA
may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or premarket approval
application, or PMA, for the modified product before we are
permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we
develop products in the future that are not considered to be
substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, we will
be required to obtain FDA approval by submitting a PMA.

The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its
review of our 510(k) or PMA submissions, or we may encounter
significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA
clearance or approval, all of which could delay or preclude sale
of new products in the United States. Furthermore, the FDA may
request additional data, require us to conduct further testing,
or compile more data, including clinical data or clinical
studies, in support of a 510(k) submission. The FDA may also,
instead of accepting a 510(k) submission, require us to submit a
PMA, which is typically a much more complex application than a
510(k). To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we
conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the
device is safe and effective, rather than substantially
equivalent to another legally marketed device. We may not be
able to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA
approval, or the FDA may not grant any necessary clearances or
approvals. In addition, the FDA may place significant
limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition
to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can
also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with
regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems
following clearance or approval. Any delays or failure to obtain
FDA clearance or approvals of new products we develop, any
limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use, or the costs
of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.



In order to conduct a clinical investigation
involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the
safety and effectiveness of a device, a company must, among
other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board,
or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if
the clinical study involves a significant risk (as
defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the
investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an
investigational device exemption, or IDE, application. We may
not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake
clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices we intend to
market in the United States in the future. If we obtain such
approvals, we may not be able to comply with the IDE and other
regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from
any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the
investigational device. Failure to obtain such approvals or to
comply with such regulations could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our products are subject to various
    international regulatory processes and approval requirements. If
    we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international
    regulatory approvals, we will not be able to market and sell our
    products in foreign countries.

To be able to market and sell our products in
other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply
with the regulations of those countries. These regulations,
including the requirements for approvals, and the time required
for regulatory review vary from country to country. Obtaining
and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive, and
we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals
in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products.
If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country
in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate
revenue will be harmed.

The European Union requires that manufacturers of
medical products obtain the right to affix the CE mark to
their products before selling them in member countries of the
European Union. The CE mark is an international symbol of
adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with
applicable European medical device directives. In order to
obtain the right to affix the CE mark to products, a
manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet
certain European quality standards. In January 1999, we received
permission to affix the CE mark to our 
da Vinci 
Surgical
System and EndoWrist instruments.

If we modify existing products or develop new
products in the future, including new instruments, we may need
to apply for permission to affix the CE mark to such products.
In addition, we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in
order to maintain the CE mark permissions we have already
obtained. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain
permission to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or
that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards
required to maintain the permissions we have already received.
If we are unable to maintain permission to affix the CE mark to
our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in
member countries of the European Union.

If institutions or surgeons are unable to
    obtain reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures
    using our products, or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover
    the costs of purchasing our products, we may be unable to
    generate sufficient sales to support our business.

Domestic institutions will typically bill the
services performed with our products to various third-party
payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs
and private insurance plans. If hospitals do not obtain
sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures
performed with our products, or if government and private
payors policies do not permit reimbursement for surgical
procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to
generate the revenues necessary to support our business.

Our success in international markets also depends
upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through
government-sponsored health care payment systems and third-party
payors. Reimbursement practices vary significantly by country.
Many international markets have government-managed healthcare
systems that control reimbursement for new products and
procedures. Other foreign



markets have both private insurance systems and
government-managed systems that control reimbursement for new
products and procedures. Market acceptance of our products may
depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in any
country within a particular time. In addition, health care cost
containment efforts similar to those we face in the United
States are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we
intend to sell our products and these efforts are expected to
continue.

Because our markets are highly competitive,
    customers may choose to purchase our competitors products
    or may not accept Intuitive surgery, which would result in
    reduced revenue and loss of market share.

Intuitive 
surgery is
a new technology that must compete with established minimally
invasive surgery and open surgery. These procedures are widely
accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long
history of use. We also face competition from several companies
that are developing new approaches and products for the
minimally invasive surgery market. In addition, we presently
face increasing competition from companies who are developing
robotic and computer-assisted surgical systems. Our revenues may
be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market
products that are more effective or less expensive than our
products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues
will suffer. We may not be able to maintain or improve our
competitive position against current or potential competitors,
especially those with greater resources. In many cases, the
medical conditions that can be treated using our products can
also be treated by drugs or other medical devices and
procedures. Many of these alternative treatments are also widely
accepted in the medical community and have a long history of
use. In addition, technological advances could make such
treatments more effective or less expensive than using our
products, which could render our products obsolete or
unmarketable. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our
products to replace or supplement established treatments or that
our products will be competitive with current or future
technologies.

If defects are discovered in our products,
    we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not
    purchase our products and our reputation may
    suffer.

Our products incorporate mechanical parts and
computer software, either of which can contain errors or
failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new
products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or
performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only
after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to
be used to perform complex surgical procedures, we expect that
our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such
defects. We cannot assure you that our products will not
experience errors or performance problems in the future. If we
experience flaws or performance problems, any of the following
could occur:

 

delays in product shipments;

 

loss of revenue;

 

delay in market acceptance;

 

diversion of our resources;

 

damage to our reputation;

 

increased service or warranty costs; or

 

product liability claims.

We have limited experience in manufacturing
    our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays
    that could result in lost revenue.

We have manufactured a limited number of our
products for sale to customers. We may be unable to establish or
maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing capacity. Even if
this capacity can be



established and maintained, the cost of doing so
may increase the cost of our products and reduce our ability to
compete. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up production
of our products, including:

 

problems involving production yields;

 

quality control and assurance;

 

component supply shortages;

 

shortages of qualified personnel; and

 

compliance with state, federal and foreign
    regulations.

Manufacturing our products is a complex process.
If demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity,
we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we
are unable to establish and maintain larger-scale manufacturing
capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited
and our reputation in the marketplace would be damaged.

If our manufacturing facilities do not
    continue to meet federal, state or European manufacturing
    standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part
    of our manufacturing operations, which would result in product
    delivery delays and lost revenue.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations
will continue to be regulated by the FDA for compliance with
Good Manufacturing Practice requirements contained in the
FDAs Quality System Regulations, or QSR. We are also
required to comply with International Organization for
Standardization, or ISO, quality system standards in order to
produce products for sale in Europe. If we fail to continue to
comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO
standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our
operations until we comply with these regulations. We are
currently in compliance with ISO standards. The FDA inspected
our Mountain View and Sunnyvale facilities in March 2000 and
December 2002, respectively. The Good Manufacturing Practice
issues raised by the FDA during the inspections either were
satisfactorily resolved with the FDA, or we believe can be
resolved by us to the FDAs satisfaction, although we
cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. We continue to
be subject to FDA inspections at any time. Maintaining such
compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that
our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing
Practice requirements or ISO standards in future inspections and
audits by regulatory authorities.

The state of California also requires that we
maintain a license to manufacture medical devices. Our
facilities and manufacturing processes were inspected in
February 1998. In March 1998, we passed the inspection and
received a device manufacturing license from the California
Department of Health Services. In March 2002, our facilities and
manufacturing processes in our Sunnyvale facility were
re-inspected by the Food and Drug Branch, or FDB, and we were
issued an updated device manufacturing license for our Sunnyvale
facility. We are subject to periodic inspections by the
California Department of Health Services and if we are unable to
maintain this license following any future inspections, we will
be unable to manufacture or ship any products.

Our reliance on sole and single source
    suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products
    in a timely manner or within budget.

Some of the components necessary for the assembly
of our products are currently provided to us by sole source
suppliers or single source suppliers. We purchase components
through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements
and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. The
disruption or termination of the supply of components could
cause a significant increase in the costs of these components,
which could affect our profitability. A disruption or
termination in the supply of components could also result in our
inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our
ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction
and damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we are required to
change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we
may be required to



verify that the new manufacturer maintains
facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and
with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays
associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could
delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner
or within budget.

The use of our products could result in
    product liability claims that could be expensive, divert
    managements attention and harm our business.

Our business exposes us to significant risks of
product liability claims. The medical device industry has
historically been litigious, and we face financial exposure to
product liability claims if the use of our products were to
cause injury or death. There is also the possibility that
defects in the design or manufacture of our products might
necessitate a product recall. Although we maintain product
liability insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may
not be adequate to cover future claims. Particularly as sales of
our products increase, we may be unable to maintain product
liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in
adequate amounts. A product liability claim, regardless of its
merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal
defense costs. A product liability claim or any product recalls
could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in
revenues.

Our growth will place a significant strain
    on our management systems and resources and, if we fail to
    manage our growth, our ability to market, sell and develop our
    products may be harmed.

In order to complete clinical trials, scale-up
manufacturing, expand marketing and distribution capabilities
and develop future products, we must expand our operations. We
expect that future expansion will occur particularly in the
areas of sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and
development. This expansion will likely result in new and
increased responsibilities for management personnel and place
significant strain upon our management, operating and financial
systems and resources. We sell our products primarily through
direct sales, and we currently have a relatively small sales
organization. Our products require a complex marketing and sales
effort targeted at several levels within a prospective
customers organization. We face significant challenges and
risks in building and managing our sales team, including
managing geographically dispersed sales efforts and adequately
training our sales people in the use and benefits of our
products. To accommodate our growth and compete effectively, we
will be required to improve our information systems, create
additional procedures and controls and expand, train, motivate
and manage our work force. Our future success will depend in
part on the ability of current and future management personnel
to operate effectively, both independently and as a group. We
cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures and
controls will be adequate to support our future operations.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable
    to attract and retain additional personnel, our ability to
    compete will be harmed.

We are highly dependent on the principal members
of our management and scientific staff. Our product development
plans depend in part on our ability to attract and retain
engineers with experience in mechanics, software and optics.
Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to
our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense.
We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable
terms given the competition for such personnel among technology
and healthcare companies, and universities. The loss of any of
these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified
personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete.

International sales of our products account
    for a significant portion of our revenues, which exposes us to
    risks inherent in international operations. Our growth may be
    limited if we are unable to successfully manage our
    international activities.

Our business currently depends in large part on
our activities in Europe, and a component of our growth strategy
is to expand our presence into additional foreign markets. Sales
to markets outside of the United States accounted for
approximately 18%, 34% and 36% of our sales for 2002, 2001, and
2000,



respectively. We will be subject to a number of
challenges that specifically relate to our international
business activities. These challenges include:

 

failure of local laws to provide the same degree
    of protection against infringement of our intellectual property;

 

protectionist laws and business practices that
    favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in
    international markets;

 

the risks associated with foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuation;

 

the expense of establishing facilities and
    operations in new foreign markets; and

 

building an organization capable of supporting
    geographically dispersed operations.

Currently, a majority of our international sales
are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could
make our products less competitive in international markets. If
we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, our
international operations may not be successful, which would
limit the growth of our business.

THE MERGER

The following is a description of the material
aspects of the merger. While we believe that the following
description covers the material terms of the merger, this
description may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A,
for a more complete understanding of the merger.

General

Each of the Intuitive Surgical board of directors
and the Computer Motion board of directors has approved the
merger agreement pursuant to which the businesses of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion will be combined in a
stock-for-stock merger. At the effective time of the merger,
Intuitive Merger Corporation (formerly Iron Acquisition
Corporation), a newly-formed subsidiary of Intuitive Surgical,
will merge with and into Computer Motion, with Computer Motion
surviving the merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Intuitive Surgical. Upon completion of the merger, Computer
Motion common stockholders will be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Intuitive Surgical common stock for each
share of Computer Motion common stock owned as of the effective
time of the merger. The fraction of a share of Intuitive
Surgical common stock to be issued with respect to each share of
Computer Motion common stock will be determined by a formula
described below. Based on the capitalization of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion and the market price of Computer
Motion common stock as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and assuming that the merger is completed
on June 20, 2003, we estimate that the exchange ratio will
be approximately 0.52. The exchange ratio will be adjusted
proportionately in the event that the proposed reverse split of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock is approved by Intuitive
Surgicals stockholders and implemented by Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors. Stockholders of Intuitive
Surgical will continue to own their existing shares.

The final exchange ratio will be calculated based
on the total number of fully diluted shares outstanding for
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion (including
out-of-the-money options and warrants for both companies)
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The
number of Computer Motions fully diluted shares will vary
based on the number of shares of Computer Motion common stock
into which Computer Motions Series D convertible
preferred stock will be convertible and the number of shares of
Computer Motion common stock which may be issued to pay accrued
dividends on the Series D convertible preferred stock upon
conversion. The Series D convertible preferred stock was
issued in accordance with an Exchange Agreement, dated
March 6, 2003, among Computer Motion and the holders of
Computer Motions Series C convertible preferred stock
and pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock were exchanged for shares of
Series D convertible preferred stock. All shares of
Computer Motion Series D convertible preferred stock will
convert into shares of Computer Motion common stock immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger. In the event that the
average of the closing bid prices of Computer Motions
common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
15 days prior to the Computer Motion special meeting is
below $1.86 per share, the conversion ratio for Computer
Motions Series D convertible preferred stock could
increase. As a result, the exchange ratio in the merger may
decrease.
After                     ,
2003, stockholders may visit Intuitive Surgicals website,

www.intuitivesurgical.com,
 or Computer Motions
website, 
www.computermotion.com,
 for announcements
regarding the exchange ratio. Computer Motion stockholders will
receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock. Please see The Merger
Agreement  The Merger Consideration and Conversion of
Securities.

Based on the estimated exchange ratio of
approximately 0.52, we estimate that, on a pre-reverse split
basis, Intuitive Surgical will issue approximately
14.7 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock in
the merger and reserve approximately 5.7 million shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock for future issuance in
connection with Intuitive Surgicals assumption of Computer
Motions outstanding options and warrants (including
out-of-the-money options and warrants).



At the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding option and warrant to purchase Computer Motion stock
will cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Computer
Motion stock and will be converted into an option or warrant to
purchase a number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock
equal to the number of shares of Computer Motion common stock
subject to such option or warrant multiplied by the exchange
ratio, at a per share exercise price equal to the existing per
share exercise price of such option or warrant divided by the
exchange ratio.

In connection with the proposed merger, Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion have obtained an immediate stay
through August 31, 2003 of all proceedings in the pending
litigation proceedings between the companies. As part of the
stays, the courts have ceased all further activity in the cases
during the period of stays and will not issue any opinions or
orders on issues already submitted for decision. The stays may
be terminated before, or extended beyond, August 31, 2003
under specified circumstances. In the event the merger is
completed, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion will request
dismissal with prejudice of the pending litigations.

Background of the Merger

Discussions between Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion regarding patents and related legal issues
occurred sporadically from 2000 through 2003. Since May 2000 and
March 2001, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion have been
engaged in patent infringement disputes in U.S. federal district
courts in California and Delaware, respectively, in addition to
various patent administrative proceedings in the patent offices
of the United States and Europe.

The pending patent litigations between the
companies have created uncertainty for each companys
products, development efforts and intellectual property, and
also have been a significant drain on each companys
financial and managerial resources. Accordingly, the companies
preliminarily discussed the topic of a potential merger on
several occasions.

In February 2001, Mr. Lonnie Smith,
Intuitive Surgicals President and CEO, and Dr. Fred
Moll, one of the founders of Intuitive Surgical and a member of
its board of directors, met with Mr. Robert Duggan,
Computer Motions Chairman and CEO, and Dr. Yulun
Wang, Computer Motions founder and then Chief Technical
Officer, in Santa Barbara, California to discuss how the ongoing
legal disputes could be resolved. After presentations by the
litigation attorneys from both sides regarding the merits of
various legal positions, the parties discussed several possible
business solutions. While the concept of a potential merger was
raised, it was not pursued further at that time.

In early 2002, Mr. Smith and Dr. Moll
again met with Mr. Duggan and Dr. Wang in Northern
California to discuss various issues related to the ongoing
legal disputes between the companies. While the meeting focused
on the potential advantages of combining the companies into a
single entity, these discussions were not pursued further due to
a lack of agreement as to financial and operational aspects of
the potential combined company.

During the next several months, Dr. Wang and
Mr. Smith had various discussions regarding whether
Intuitive Surgical would be willing to make an offer to merge
the companies, which offer Dr. Wang could then take to the
board of directors of Computer Motion. These discussions led to
an exploration of how the ongoing legal disputes could be
settled without a merger.

In May 2002, the U.S. Patent Office ruled in
favor of Intuitive Surgical regarding one of Computer
Motions AESOP patents and one of its ZEUS patents. In June
2002, Computer Motion brought a new litigation in California
federal court challenging the Patent Office rulings.

In late May 2002, the Delaware federal court
granted summary judgment that Computer Motions AESOP and
ZEUS products literally infringed IBM Corporations and
Intuitive Surgicals U.S. patent rights on
voice-controlled surgical robots and that Computer Motions
HERMES product infringed to the extent such product interacts
with the AESOP and ZEUS products. In August 2002, after a
multi-day trial, a Delaware jury returned a verdict in favor of
Intuitive Surgical, finding that Computer Motion had failed to
prove that the patent was invalid and awarding Intuitive
Surgical $4.4 million for damage caused



by Computer Motions sales of infringing
products. The parties then focused on Computer Motions
prosecution laches defense, which the judge in the
Delaware case was to decide.

During the week of September 20, 2002 at the
European Association of CardioThoracic Surgeons conference,
executives from Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion held
various discussions regarding the ongoing legal patent disputes
in the U.S. District courts, including a discussion of the
significant costs of litigation and the associated drain on
management resources.

After further discussions during the week of
September 29, 2002 concerning possible ways of settling the
ongoing patent disputes, both companies agreed to a meeting the
following week. On October 4, 2002, Susan Barnes, Intuitive
Surgicals Chief Financial Officer, Aleks Cukic, Intuitive
Surgicals Vice President of Business Development and
Strategic Planning, and David Shaw, Intuitive Surgicals
Vice President of Legal Affairs, met in Santa Barbara with
Darrin Uecker, Computer Motions Chief Technical Officer,
Joseph DeVivo, Computer Motions President and Chief
Operating Officer, and Ken Stein, Computer Motions
Director of Intellectual Property, to discuss a possible
settlement of the pending patent litigations. During this
meeting, the possibility of combining the two companies was
again raised.

During the ensuing weeks, further telephonic
discussions took place between senior executives of the
companies. During these discussions, the parties further
evaluated the possibility of forming a new company by merging
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion and determined that
another meeting would be in order.

On October 21, 2002, Ms. Barnes and
Messrs. Cukic and Shaw of Intuitive Surgical again met with
Messrs. Uecker and DeVivo of Computer Motion in Sunnyvale,
California. During the meeting, the participants concluded that
since discussions to settle the litigation through a
cross-license were proving of limited value, a more productive
discussion would focus on merging the two companies. The
remainder of the meeting was spent discussing the possibility of
a merger at a broad conceptual level. The representatives of
Intuitive Surgical indicated that Intuitive Surgical would
consider making a good-faith offer, and the representatives of
Computer Motion indicated that, in the event such an offer was
received, Computer Motion would review the offer and determine
whether the offer was in the best interests of Computer
Motions stockholders. At that time, Computer Motion was in
the final stages of negotiating a new round of financing, so the
parties agreed to move quickly.

After the October 21, 2002 meeting,
executives of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion had various
telephonic discussions regarding the possible structure and
timeline for a potential offer and the status of Computer
Motions pending financing transaction. During this same
time period, Mr. Smith had several telephonic conversations with
various members of Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
to keep them apprised, both formally and informally, of
Intuitive Surgicals discussions with Computer Motion.

On October 24, 2002, Intuitive Surgical sent
to Computer Motion a preliminary, non-binding proposal to merge
the two companies. The proposal contemplated a combination of
the two companies to form a single surviving entity, 85% of the
equity of which would be owned by the existing equity holders of
Intuitive Surgical and 15% of the equity of which would be owned
by the existing equity holders of Computer Motion. After
reviewing the proposal, the board of directors of Computer
Motion determined that (1) the valuation of Computer Motion
contemplated by the proposal was inappropriately low,
(2) Computer Motion would not accept the terms of the
proposal and (3) Computer Motion would not make a counter
proposal. Instead, the board of directors of Computer Motion
determined to complete the pending financing to further fund
Computer Motions operations. Despite the failure to reach
an agreement at this time, the companies agreed that the effort
had been productive and might help in any future attempts to
merge the two companies.

Following the failed merger discussions,
settlement discussions again focused on paths to settle the
ongoing patent disputes, especially in light of the anticipated
rulings of the federal court in Delaware on Computer
Motions defense of prosecution laches. The
parties began to discuss potential elements of a settlement
proposal, including identification of specific patents and
related intellectual property that might be included in a
potential cross-license agreement. During early December 2002, a
conference call between



representatives of the companies and their
respective internal patent counsel was held to discuss the
parameters of a potential settlement in greater detail. On
December 10, 2002, the Delaware court ruled in Intuitive
Surgicals favor on Computer Motions prosecution
laches defense. Upon learning of such ruling, the parties were
unable to reach agreement as to the terms of a mutually
acceptable settlement and the detailed settlement discussions
terminated on December 11, 2002.

During the week of January 27, 2003,
executives of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion met at the
Society of Thoracic Surgeons conference in San Diego, California
and again discussed the topic of settling the ongoing patent
disputes, including by means of a merger of the companies.

After a series of further discussions in early
February 2003 in which the status of the various litigations and
the companies respective views with regard to the merits
and risks of those litigations were addressed, the companies
once again began to discuss the possibility of a merger. On
February 7, 2003, executives of Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion agreed that the concept of a combination of the
two companies merited further consideration. Immediately
following that discussion, the parties were informed that the
federal court in California granted partial summary judgment in
favor of Computer Motion on its allegations that Intuitive
Surgicals 
da Vinci 
surgical system literally
infringes a claim of Computer Motions 809 patent.

During the next several weeks, representatives of
the companies had various conversations. These conversations
were based on a mutual view that ongoing patent litigation
threatened the potential growth of a promising portion of the
surgical industry, and that finite financial and management
resources were better utilized in advancing the products and
technologies of the companies. The companies agreed that a
settlement of the pending litigations was in the best interests
of the companies, and that a merger transaction between the
companies could be an effective method of reaching such a
settlement.

On February 13, 2003, Computer Motion
secured a $2.3 million short-term bridge loan enabling it
to obtain a bond related to the Delaware case.

On February 18 and again on
February 25, 2003, outside litigation counsel for both
companies discussed the possibility of a merger, including the
timing of a potential merger transaction vis--vis the
trial in federal court in California.

On February 25, 2003, Messrs. Smith and
Duggan spoke by telephone and arranged for a team from Computer
Motion to meet face-to-face with a team from Intuitive Surgical
to attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable merger transaction
that would end the pending patent litigations.

During the evening of February 25, 2003,
Mr. Duggan met with Messrs. DeVivo and Uecker to
prepare for the meeting with Intuitive Surgical and to discuss
the parameters of an acceptable merger transaction.

On February 26, 2003, Messrs. DeVivo
and Uecker of Computer Motion met with Ms. Barnes and
Messrs. Smith and Cukic of Intuitive Surgical in Sunnyvale,
California. At the meeting, the parties discussed the economic
terms of a proposed merger transaction. Following discussions
among representatives of Computer Motion, including
Messrs. DeVivo, Uecker and Duggan, and further discussions
among representatives of Intuitive Surgical, the parties
negotiated a term sheet that contemplated a merger of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion, subject to negotiation of a
definitive agreement and approval by the board of directors of
each company. The term sheet contemplated that Computer
Motions equity holders would own 32% and Intuitive
Surgicals equity holders would own 68% of the combined
company on a fully diluted basis. The term sheet also
contemplated that the combined company would have a nine-member
board of directors, including Mr. Duggan and another
director to be designated by Computer Motion. The term sheet
also contemplated that, upon execution of a definitive merger
agreement, the parties would jointly request stays of all
pending litigations and patent administrative actions between
the parties and that Computer Motion would be relieved from the
Delaware courts requirement that it post a
$2.2 million bond as security for the damage award in the
Delaware case. In addition, the term sheet contemplated that a
$10.0 million termination fee would be payable by any party
that failed to perform its obligations under the definitive
merger agreement.



During the week of February 24, 2003,
Mr. Duggan updated the board of directors of Computer
Motion on the status of discussions with Intuitive Surgical
regarding the proposed merger transaction and the Board directed
Mr. Duggan and management of Computer Motion to continue to
move forward with discussions on behalf of Computer Motion.

Both before and after the February 26, 2003
meeting, Mr. Smith had a series of conversations with
various members of Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
to apprise them of events and to seek their views regarding the
ongoing discussions with Computer Motion.

Intuitive Surgical engaged Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc. on February 27, 2003 to render
a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed transaction.

On February 27, 2003, representatives of
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion and their respective
outside counsel met in Los Angeles, California. At this meeting,
the parties discussed the terms of the proposed transaction, as
well as the process and timing related to execution of a
definitive merger agreement. In addition, the parties commenced
detailed business and legal due diligence on one another.

On February 28, 2003, outside counsel to
Intuitive Surgical presented to Computer Motion and its counsel
drafts of an exclusivity agreement and a mutual confidentiality
agreement. The exclusivity agreement, which was executed by the
parties on March 3, 2003, provided that, until
March 6, 2003, Computer Motion would not solicit any
proposals to acquire Computer Motion and would not negotiate
with any other party or enter into any agreement with any other
party relating to an acquisition proposal. Intuitive Surgical
also agreed to a reciprocal provision with respect to proposals
to acquire Intuitive Surgical. The parties executed the mutual
confidentiality agreement on March 3, 2003.

During the period from February 28, 2003 to
March 4, 2003, the parties and their respective outside
counsel and Bear Stearns and H.C. Wainwright met in Newport
Beach, California to prepare and negotiate drafts of a
definitive merger agreement and to continue business and legal
due diligence. On February 28, 2003, counsel to Intuitive
Surgical presented to Computer Motion and its counsel a draft of
the merger agreement, which provided for a reverse triangular
merger of Computer Motion with a newly-formed subsidiary of
Intuitive Surgical. The draft merger agreement also contemplated
that the directors and executive officers of each party would
execute stockholder support agreements pursuant to which they
would agree to vote their shares of stock in favor of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Thereafter,
the parties engaged in extensive negotiations regarding the
various terms of the merger agreement, including the following:

 

In calculating the exchange ratio in accordance
    with the 68%/32% split of fully diluted shares referenced in the
    term sheet, the parties discussed whether certain warrants to
    acquire Computer Motion stock, which warrants had an exercise
    price that was significantly higher than the current market
    price and which were due to expire within one year, should be
    included in the fully diluted calculation. The parties agreed to
    exclude these warrants from the calculation of the exchange
    ratio.

 

The parties discussed the $10 million
    reciprocal termination fee referenced in the term sheet. Based
    on discussion among counsel regarding the enforceability of a
    termination fee of that size in the context of the proposed
    transaction, the parties agreed that the reciprocal termination
    fee would be limited to $2.5 million.

 

Computer Motion objected to having a material
    adverse change condition in the merger agreement, principally
    because of uncertainty as to the effect that the announcement of
    the proposed transaction might have on Computer Motions
    revenues, as customers might delay purchasing decisions pending
    completion of the merger and clarification of the combined
    companys business strategy going forward. Intuitive
    Surgical agreed to limit the material adverse change condition
    to the following three events: (1) any material impairment
    of Computer Motions intellectual property; (2) any
    material change in Computer Motions outstanding
    capitalization; and (3) the incurrence by Computer Motion
    of any material liabilities or obligations prior to the closing
    of the merger.



 

Due to Computer Motions financial position
    and concern that announcement of the proposed transaction could
    adversely impact its revenues prior to the closing, Computer
    Motion requested that Intuitive Surgical provide it with a
    working capital line of credit of up to $7.3 million to
    meet its liquidity needs prior to the closing. The parties
    negotiated a loan agreement and security agreement in parallel
    with negotiation of the merger agreement.

 

Due to Computer Motions concern that if it
    were to agree to a stay of all pending litigations, it would
    lose its ability to move rapidly to trial in California if the
    merger were not completed and the stay in the District Court in
    California ultimately were lifted, the parties agreed to a
    procedure to request a trial date within a specified period of
    time after the termination date of the stay, if the merger
    agreement were to terminate.

 

The parties and their respective counsel reviewed
    the terms of Computer Motions outstanding Series C
    Preferred Stock in light of the proposed transaction. The
    parties determined that it would be desirable to have the
    holders of the Series C Preferred Stock exchange their
    shares into a newly-created class of Series D convertible
    preferred stock. The Series D convertible preferred stock
    would (1) provide that the holders would be entitled to
    convert their shares at a conversion ratio that generally would
    return a minimum of 135% of their original purchase price, based
    on the trading prices of Computer Motions common stock
    prior to completion of the merger and (2) provide that the
    holders would vote together with the holders of common stock in
    the vote by Computer Motions stockholders on the proposed
    merger. From March 3 to March 6, 2003, Computer Motion
    negotiated the terms of the exchange with the holders of its
    Series C Preferred Stock. In connection with this
    negotiation, the holders of Computer Motions Series D
    convertible preferred stock requested, and Computer Motion
    agreed, to reduce the exercise price on outstanding warrants
    held by the preferred stockholders to acquire Computer Motion
    common stock. The exercise price on one series of warrants to
    acquire 1,759,345 shares was reduced from $1.78 to $1.50 per
    share, and on another series to acquire 1,759,345 shares, from
    $2.17 to $1.50 per share. On March 6, Computer Motion
    executed exchange agreements with the holders of all outstanding
    shares of Series C Preferred Stock.

On March 5, 2003, Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors held a special meeting in Sunnyvale,
California at which senior management of Intuitive Surgical and
Bear Stearns and outside legal counsel of Intuitive Surgical
were present in person or by telephone. Senior management of
Intuitive Surgical made presentations on the background and
strategic rationale for the proposed transaction.
Representatives of Latham & Watkins LLP, Intuitive
Surgicals outside legal counsel, reviewed with the
Intuitive Surgical board of directors the terms of the proposed
agreements and the fiduciary duties of the Intuitive Surgical
board of directors. Representatives of Bear Stearns made a
presentation on the financial aspects of the proposed
transaction, and confirmed that Bear Stearns was prepared, upon
request of the board and subject to finalization of the terms of
the transaction, to render an opinion as to the fairness of the
transaction from a financial point of view to Intuitive
Surgical. After discussion among the members of the board and
the financial and legal advisors, Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors authorized management to continue
negotiations of the definitive agreements with Computer Motion.

Also on the evening of March 5, 2003,
Computer Motions board of directors held a special
telephonic meeting to consider the proposed merger with
Intuitive Surgical. At this meeting, Mr. Duggan reported to
the Computer Motion board of directors on the strategic and
business rationale as well as the risks for this transaction.
Representatives of Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth reviewed
with the directors their fiduciary duties. Representatives of
H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. presented its financial
analysis of the transaction and discussed the analysis with the
board. H.C. Wainwright then delivered its oral opinion that
the exchange ratio in the merger was fair to Computer
Motions stockholders from a financial point of view and
indicated that it would render a written opinion to that effect.
Representatives of Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth then
reported to the board on the material terms and conditions of
the merger agreement and the related transaction documents.
Following these presentations, the Computer Motion board of
directors asked various questions and discussed the potential
merger, following which, by unanimous vote, it determined that
the merger was fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
Computer Motion and its



stockholders, and approved the merger, the merger
agreement and related matters subject to the resolution of some
open issues primarily related to the working capital line of
credit.

During the morning on March 6, 2003, the
Intuitive Surgical board of directors held a telephonic meeting
attended by Intuitive Surgicals senior management, Bear
Stearns and outside legal counsel. Senior management of
Intuitive Surgical and Intuitive Surgicals legal counsel
and Bear Stearns made presentations on the status of
negotiations of the terms of the proposed merger agreement.
After discussion among the members of the board and the Bear
Stearns and legal counsel, Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors authorized management to continue negotiations of the
definitive agreements with Computer Motion.

During the evening of March 6, 2003, the
Intuitive Surgical board of directors held a telephonic meeting
attended by Intuitive Surgicals senior management, Bear
Stearns and outside legal counsel. Senior management of
Intuitive Surgical and Intuitive Surgicals legal counsel
and Bear Stearns made presentations on the outcome of final
negotiations of the terms of the proposed merger agreement. A
representative of Bear Stearns delivered Bear Stearns oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that the exchange
ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to Intuitive
Surgical. Following further discussion, the Intuitive Surgical
board of directors, by the unanimous vote of those directors
present, (1) determined that the terms of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Intuitive Surgical and its stockholders, (2) adopted
resolutions approving the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and recommending that
Intuitive Surgicals stockholders approve and adopt the
merger agreement and (3) approved the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Also during the evening of March 6, 2003,
Computer Motions board of directors held a special
meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Stradling Yocca
Carlson & Rauth summarized for the Computer Motion board of
directors the modifications to the form of merger agreement that
was approved at the March 5, 2003 meeting as well as
modifications to the loan agreement regarding the working
capital line of credit. At the same meeting, the Computer Motion
board of directors unanimously approved the merger, the merger
agreement and related transaction documents.

On March 7, 2003, prior to the opening of
the Nasdaq National Market, Intuitive Surgical, Intuitive Merger
Corporation and Computer Motion executed the merger agreement
and the loan agreement, and the stockholder voting agreements
were executed by the applicable parties. Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion issued a joint press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger  Intuitive
Surgical

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and recommends that the
Intuitive Surgical stockholders vote 
FOR 
the
proposal to issue Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to
the merger agreement.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
considered a variety of factors, a number of which are
summarized below:

 

Complementary Nature of
    Technologies.
 Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors believes there is a strategic
    fit between the technologies of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
    Motion, including the core competencies, intellectual property
    rights and focus areas of the companies. Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors believes that the merger will
    permit all major products and technologies currently provided by
    both companies to survive to the benefit of the surgical
    community for the foreseeable future. Intuitive Surgicals
    board of directors further believes that the merger will permit
    the companies to focus the talent and energy of the combined
    organization on developing and growing the application of
    robotics to minimally invasive surgery, bringing significant
    benefits to patients, surgeons and medical centers throughout
    the world. Intuitive Surgicals board of directors believes
    that the combined company has the opportunity to enhance its
    future prospects through the



development of products utilizing the
    technologies and expertise of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
    Motion.

 

Dismissal of Patent
    Litigations.
 Intuitive Surgicals
    board of directors weighed the benefits of the dismissal of the
    pending patent litigations with Computer Motion upon completion
    of the merger. Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
    considered the diversion of managements attention and
    significant expense associated with ongoing patent litigation.
    Intuitive Surgicals board of directors also weighed the
    possibility that the litigation could result in Intuitive
    Surgical being found to infringe the intellectual property
    rights of Computer Motion, which could be ruled to be valid and
    enforceable and could result in Intuitive Surgical being
    required either to obtain a license from, and pay damages and/or
    royalties to, Computer Motion or, in the event the parties were
    unable to agree on the terms of a license, to redesign or
    withdraw from the market one or more of Intuitive
    Surgicals products or product configurations.

 

Synergies.
 Intuitive
    Surgicals board of directors evaluated the potential
    synergies of a combination of Intuitive Surgical with Computer
    Motion, including the complementary nature of the businesses of
    Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion and the opportunity for
    significant cost savings. Intuitive Surgicals board of
    directors noted that, although no assurances can be given that
    any particular level of synergies will be achieved, Intuitive
    Surgicals management anticipates annual pre-tax cost
    savings of up to approximately $18 million commencing in
    late 2003 as a result of the merger. A significant portion of
    the cost savings will result from a substantial reduction in
    headcount. Intuitive Surgicals ability to achieve these
    goals is subject to economic conditions and unanticipated
    changes in business conditions, and therefore there can be no
    assurance that these results will be achieved. Please see
    Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
    Statements.

 

Terms of Merger Agreement.

Intuitive Surgicals board of
    directors reviewed the terms of the merger agreement, including
    the following:

(1) 

the merger agreement provides certainty as to the
    maximum number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock to
    be issued to Computer Motion equity holders and the percentage
    of the total shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock that
    Computer Motion equity holders will own after the merger on a
    fully diluted basis. Intuitive Surgicals board of
    directors also considered the premium that the merger
    consideration implied;

(2) 

the provisions of the merger agreement that limit
    the ability of Computer Motion to solicit other acquisition
    offers. Intuitive Surgicals board of directors also
    considered the provisions that require the payment of up to a
    $2.5 million termination fee by Intuitive Surgical or
    Computer Motion if the merger agreement is terminated due to
    specified reasons. Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
    believes that these provisions were reasonable under the
    circumstances; and

(3) 

the conditions to completion of the merger, in
    particular the likelihood of obtaining the necessary stockholder
    approvals, the absence of any material regulatory conditions and
    the likelihood that the merger would be completed.

 

Fairness Opinion of Bear, Stearns & Co.
    Inc. 
Intuitive Surgicals board
    of directors reviewed the presentation of Bear Stearns and the
    opinion of Bear Stearns as of March 6, 2003, as to the
    fairness, from a financial point of view, to Intuitive Surgical
    of the exchange ratio in the merger. Please see Opinion of
    Bear Stearns to Intuitive Surgical.

 

Purchase Accounting Treatment.

Intuitive Surgicals board of
    directors considered the expected purchase accounting treatment
    of the merger as an acquisition of Computer Motion by Intuitive
    Surgical.



In addition, Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger, a number of which are summarized below:

 

the risk that the potential benefits sought in
    the merger might not be fully realized;

 

the risk that the costs of completing the merger
    and integrating the operations of the two companies could
    deplete Intuitive Surgicals cash resources prior to the
    combined company becoming profitable;

 

the possibility that the merger might not be
    completed, or that completion might be unduly delayed;

 

the effect of public announcement of the merger
    on Intuitive Surgicals stock price;

 

the potential impact of the merger on the
    strategic partners, employees and customers of the companies, as
    well as any rights that might accrue under contractual
    arrangements if the merger were deemed to constitute a
    change in control;

 

the fact that the Intuitive Surgical common stock
    to be issued in the merger will represent an estimated 28% of
    the then outstanding common stock of the combined company, and
    thus existing Intuitive Surgical stockholders would experience
    significant dilution in their percentage ownership of Intuitive
    Surgical as a result of the merger;

 

the risk that managements efforts to
    integrate the two companies will disrupt Intuitive
    Surgicals operations;

 

the risk that Computer Motion may be unable to
    repay up to $7.3 million to be loaned by Intuitive Surgical
    to Computer Motion under the Loan and Security Agreement;

 

the substantial costs incurred in connection with
    the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses of the
    two companies, severance costs associated with reduction in
    personnel, and transaction expenses arising from the merger;

 

the risk that despite the efforts of the combined
    company, key management and employees might not remain employed
    by the combined company; and

 

various other risks associated with the merger
    and the businesses of Intuitive Surgical, Computer Motion and
    the combined company described in the section entitled
    Risk Factors and in the documents incorporated by
    reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
concluded, however, that overall, the potentially negative
factors associated with the merger were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the merger.

The above discussion of the factors considered by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors is not intended to
be exhaustive, but is believed to set forth the principal
factors considered by Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors. Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
collectively reached the unanimous conclusion to approve the
merger agreement in light of the various factors described above
and other factors that each member of Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors felt were appropriate. In view of the wide
variety of factors considered by Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and
the complexity of these matters, Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors did not consider it practical, and did not attempt,
to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. Rather,
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors made its
recommendation based on the totality of information presented to
and the investigation conducted by it. In considering the
factors discussed above, individual directors may have given
different weights to different factors.

INTUITIVE SURGICALS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT INTUITIVE SURGICAL STOCKHOLDERS VOTE

FOR 
THE PROPOSAL TO ISSUE INTUITIVE SURGICAL
COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT.



Reasons for the Merger  Computer
Motion

In reaching its decision to approve the merger,
Computer Motions board of directors identified and
considered a number of potential benefits for Computer Motion
and its stockholders that supported the boards decision to
approve the merger. These potential benefits include the
following:

 

the fact that the combination of the product
    lines, sales channels and financial resources of Intuitive
    Surgical and Computer Motion should result in a combined company
    that is even more capable of applying surgical robotics to
    traditional surgery, with the ability to offer surgeons and
    hospitals the best possible products and support to serve their
    patients needs in minimally invasive surgery;

 

the elimination of costly, long-term patent
    disputes between Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical, the
    elimination of the potential withdrawal from the market of one
    or more of Computer Motions products or product
    configurations, and the ability of the combined company to
    initiate technology sharing and focus its efforts on developing
    and growing the application of robotics to minimally invasive
    surgery;

 

a stronger balance sheet and cash position
    resulting from a combination of the two companies;

 

the fact that the merger would combine two
    experienced and respected management teams, resulting in a
    combined management team that is stronger than the management
    teams of each of the individual companies;

 

the synergies and cost-saving opportunities that
    should result from the combination of the two organizations, as
    redundant operations are eliminated or streamlined;

 

the larger public float of Intuitive Surgical
    common stock and the corresponding likelihood of increased
    trading liquidity for Computer Motion stockholders as a result
    of the merger; and

 

the fact that the merger is expected to be
    tax-free to Computer Motions stockholders who receive
    Intuitive Surgical common stock in exchange for their Computer
    Motion common stock in the merger (except to the extent they
    receive cash in lieu of fractional shares).

In addition to the potential benefits accruing to
Computer Motion and its stockholders from the merger, Computer
Motions board of directors also considered a number of
other factors in approving the merger, including the following:

 

Computer Motion managements view of the
    business and prospects of Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical
    as stand-alone companies and as a combined company;

 

historical and recent financial data concerning
    Computer Motions and Intuitive Surgicals respective
    businesses and financial performances;

 

historical market prices, trading volume and
    projected earnings of Computer Motion common stock and Intuitive
    Surgical common stock;

 

the financial analyses and presentation of H.C.
    Wainwright & Co., Inc. delivered to the Computer Motion
    board of directors on March 5, 2003, as well as the opinion
    of H.C. Wainwright, dated March 5, 2003, that, as of such
    date, the exchange ratio of Intuitive Surgical common stock for
    each share of Computer Motion common stock in the merger
    agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders
    of Computer Motion common stock and preferred stock. A copy of
    H.C. Wainwrights opinion is attached as Annex E to this
    joint proxy statement/prospectus;

 

the contractual terms of the merger agreement and
    related transaction documents, including the number of shares of
    Intuitive Surgical common stock being offered to Computer Motion
    stockholders, representations and warranties of the parties,
    conditions to closing and termination fee provisions; and



 

the interest that certain Computer Motion
    officers and directors may have in the merger, in addition to
    their interest as Computer Motion stockholders. Please see
    The Merger  Interests of Directors and
    Executive Officers of Computer Motion in the Merger.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger,
Computer Motions board of directors also identified and
considered a number of potentially negative factors that could
result from the merger, including the following:

 

the risk that integration of the businesses,
    products and personnel of the two companies will not be
    successfully implemented and may require a significant amount of
    management time and resources;

 

the risk that the potential synergies and
    cost-saving opportunities identified by Computer Motion and
    Intuitive Surgical will not be fully realized;

 

the risk that the merger may not be well received
    by customers, business partners and employees of the two
    companies;

 

the negative impact on the projected revenue of
    the combined company resulting from areas of business overlap;

 

the risk that Computer Motion may be required to
    repay up to $7.3 million borrowed under the Loan and
    Security Agreement;

 

the risk that, in the event that the average
    price per share of Computer Motion common stock during a period
    of 20 trading days ending 15 days prior to the
    Computer Motion special meeting is below $1.86, the conversion
    ratio for Computer Motions Series D convertible
    preferred stock could increase and, as a result, the exchange
    ratio in the merger could decrease;

 

the significant cost that will be incurred in
    seeking to complete the merger; and

 

the risk that the merger may not be completed.

Computer Motions board of directors
evaluated all of the factors described above in light of their
knowledge of Computer Motions business, financial
condition and prospects, Intuitive Surgicals business,
financial condition and prospects, and the broad surgical
markets in which surgical robotics must compete. In view of the
variety of factors considered by Computer Motions board of
directors in its evaluation of the merger, Computer
Motions board of directors did not find it practicable to,
and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the
specific factors considered in reaching its decision. In
addition, individual members of Computer Motions board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors.
The list of factors described in this section as having been
considered by Computer Motions board of directors is not
intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all of the
material factors considered by Computer Motions board of
directors.

After considering all of the information and
factors described in this section, Computer Motions board
of directors unanimously approved the merger, the merger
agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Computer Motions board of directors believes
that the merger is consistent with, and in furtherance of,
Computer Motions long term business strategy and that the
merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
Computer Motion and its stockholders. Computer Motions
board of directors has unanimously recommended that the Computer
Motion stockholders vote FOR the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement.

Opinion of Bear Stearns to Intuitive
Surgical

Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., or Bear
Stearns, has rendered an opinion to Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Intuitive Surgical of the exchange ratio in the merger.
The full text of the written opinion, dated as of March 6,
2003, is attached to this document as 
Annex D
. We
encourage you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety
to understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Bear
Stearns in providing their opinion. 
The opinion of Bear
Stearns is directed to Intuitive Surgicals board of

merger.

Opinion of Bear Stearns

At a meeting of Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors held on March 6, 2003, at which Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors considered the merger and
approved the merger agreement and the merger, Bear Stearns
rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in a
written opinion, dated as of March 6, 2003) that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the matters reviewed
with Intuitive Surgicals board of directors, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair to Intuitive Surgical from a
financial point of view.

The description of the Bear Stearns opinion set
forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the

management, the senior management of Intuitive Surgical advised
Bear Stearns that such Computer Motion projections prepared by
Intuitive Surgical management are based on the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the senior management of
Intuitive Surgical after discussions with the senior management
of Computer Motion. Bear Stearns did not assume any
responsibility for the independent verification of any such
information or of the Intuitive Surgical projections, the
Computer Motion projections, the Computer Motion projections
prepared by Intuitive Surgical and the estimated cost savings
provided to Bear Stearns, and Bear Stearns further relied upon
the assurances of the senior managements of Intuitive Surgical
and Computer Motion that they were unaware of any facts that
would make the information, the Intuitive Surgical projections,
the Computer Motion projections, the Computer Motion projections
prepared by Intuitive Surgical management and the estimated cost
savings provided to them incomplete or misleading.

In arriving at their opinion, Bear Stearns did
not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Intuitive Surgical or
Computer Motion, nor was Bear Stearns furnished with any such
appraisals. Bear Stearns assumed that the merger would be
completed in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement without any limitations, restrictions,
conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or
otherwise, that collectively would have a material effect on
Intuitive Surgical or Computer Motion.



Bear Stearns did not express any opinion as to
the price or range of prices at which the Intuitive Surgical
Common Stock and Computer Motion Common Stock may trade
subsequent to the announcement of the merger or as to the price
or range of prices at which the Intuitive Surgical Common Stock
may trade subsequent to completion of the merger.

Bear Stearns has been previously engaged by
Intuitive Surgical to provide certain investment banking and
financial advisory services for which they received customary
fees. In the ordinary course of business, Bear Stearns and its
affiliates may actively trade the equity and debt securities
and/or bank debt of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion for
their own account and for the account of their customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
such securities or bank debt.

.

Contribution
Analysis.
 Bear Stearns performed a
contribution analysis to assist Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors in valuing Computer Motion based on the relative
contribution of each company to the combined pro forma entity.
In performing the analyses, Bear Stearns used the financial
projections for Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion, both
prepared by Intuitive Surgical management, and public
information. Bear Stearns calculated the relative contribution
by both Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion to the combined
entity with respect to the enterprise value and equity value at
market (based on the closing share price of Intuitive
Surgicals common stock and Computer Motions common
stock as of March 6, 2003) and at the implied exchange
ratio in the merger as of announcement date, and projected
financial data including revenues, gross profit, EBITDA, EBIT
and net income without estimated cost savings and assuming
realization of 100% and 50% of estimated cost savings expected
to result in the merger.

Valuation of Estimated Cost Savings.

Bear Stearns performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of the estimated cost savings expected to
result from the merger (net of any one-time costs to achieve
such cost savings). In valuing the estimated cost savings, Bear
Stearns used illustrative discount rates ranging from 14 to 16%,
illustrative perpetual growth rates of 2 to 4% and assumed
realization of 100% and 50% of estimated cost savings expected
to result in the merger.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.

Based on cash flow projections for
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion as prepared by Intuitive
Surgical and the estimated cost savings expected to result in
the merger prepared by the management of Intuitive Surgical
management, Bear Stearns performed a discounted cash flow
analysis to assist the Intuitive Surgical board of directors in
valuing Intuitive Surgical, Computer Motion and the pro forma
combined company.

Bear Stearns performed discounted cash flow
analysis assuming:

 

for Intuitive Surgical, a range of illustrative
    discount rates of 13.0% to 15.0% and a range of terminal EBITDA
    multiples (based on 2007 EBITDA) of 8.0x to 10.0x;

 

for Computer Motion, a range of illustrative
    discount rates of 15.0% to 17.0% and a range of terminal EBITDA
    multiples (based on 2007 EBITDA) of 8.0x to 10.0x; and

 

for estimated cost savings, a range of
    illustrative discount rates of 14.0% to 16.0% and illustrative
    perpetual growth rates of 2.0% to 4.0%.

Discounted cash flow valuations were calculated
for Intuitive Surgical on a stand-alone basis, Computer Motion
on a stand-alone basis both including and excluding estimated
cost savings and the pro forma combined company including
estimated cost savings.



Using this analysis, Bear Stearns derived a range
of implied equity values per share for Intuitive Surgical,

Comparable Public Companies Analysis.

Bear Stearns performed a comparable
public companies analysis to assist the Intuitive Surgical board
of directors in valuing Computer Motion based on various
financial multiples of selected comparable public companies in
the medical technology industry. In performing this analysis,
Bear Stearns reviewed certain financial information relating to
Computer Motion and compared such information to the
corresponding financial information of other publicly-traded
medical technology companies which Bear Stearns deemed to be
generally comparable to Computer Motion.

Bear Stearns compared the projected financial
performance and the resulting multiples as of March 6, 2003
of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion, and the resulting
multiples of Computer Motion at the implied exchange ratio as of
the merger announcement date to ten publicly-traded medical
technology companies which it deemed generally comparable to
Computer Motion. Such comparable companies consisted of:

 Align Technology, Inc.

     American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc.

     ArthoCare Corporation

     CTI Molecular Imaging, Inc.

     Given Imaging Ltd.

 Kyphon Inc.

     Laserscope

     Rita Medical Systems, Inc.

     TheraSense, Inc.

     Wilson Greatbatch Technologies, Inc.

Using publicly available information and market
data as of March 6, 2003, and in the case of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion, information based on Intuitive
Surgical management estimates for revenues and gross profit for
both Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion, Bear Stearns
calculated the following harmonic mean multiples for the above
public comparable companies:

Harmonic mean is calculated by using
the reciprocals of the multiples and gives equal weight to equal
dollar investments in the securities whose ratios are being
averaged. Bear Stearns utilizes the harmonic mean in averaging
ratios in which price is the numerator. Enterprise
value is calculated as the sum of the value of the common
equity on a fully diluted basis and the value of net debt, any
minority interest and preferred stock. Intuitive Surgical
at market is defined as Intuitive Surgicals
enterprise value based on the closing share price of the
Intuitive Surgical common stock as of March 6, 2003.
Computer Motion at market is defined as Computer
Motions enterprise value based on the closing share price
of the Computer Motion common stock as of March 6, 2003.
Computer Motion at deal is defined as Computer
Motions enterprise value based on the implied exchange
ratio as of the announcement date of the merger.

Bear Stearns noted that the transaction multiples
analyzed for the merger of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion fell within the range of the corresponding multiples for
all the selected precedent transactions.

Bear Stearns noted that none of the precedent
transactions were identical to the merger of Intuitive Surgical
and Computer Motion and that, accordingly, any analysis of the
precedent transactions necessarily involved complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in industry
and individual company dynamics, stock market valuation
parameters, financial and operating characteristics and various
other factors that would necessarily affect the transactions
multiples in the merger as compared to the multiples for the
precedent transactions.



Pro Forma Merger Analysis.

Bear Stearns performed a pro forma
merger analysis to assist the Intuitive board of directors in
analyzing the financial impact of the merger on Intuitive
Surgical. Bear Stearns reviewed and analyzed certain pro forma
financial impacts of the merger on holders of Intuitive Surgical
based on the following, among other items:

 

the implied exchange ratio as of the announcement
    date of the merger;

 

the financial projections provided to Bear
    Stearns by the management of Intuitive Surgical for both
    Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion;

 

an assumption for analytical purposes that the
    combination of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion would
    realize estimated pre-tax cost savings of up to approximately
    $18 million annually (tax-effected at a 35% tax rate); and

 

an assumption for analytical purposes that there
    would be no financial statement impact of potential
    restructuring costs or other one-time costs associated with the
    merger and that the transaction was effective as of
    January 1, 2003.

The following table shows the projected per share
accretion/(dilution) to Intuitive Surgicals pro forma

Miscellaneous

In connection with rendering their opinion, Bear
Stearns performed a variety of financial analyses. The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of these methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. Accordingly, notwithstanding the analyses
summarized above, Bear Stearns believes that its analyses must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the
analyses and factors considered by them, without considering all
such analyses and factors, or attempting to ascribe relative
weights to some or all such analyses and factors, could create
an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the Bear
Stearns opinion.

In performing their analyses, Bear Stearns made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of Intuitive Surgical. The
analyses performed by Bear Stearns are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such
analyses. Bear Stearns did not assign any specific weight to any
of the analyses described above and did not draw any specific
conclusions from or with regard to any one method of analysis.
With respect to the analysis of comparable companies and the
analysis of selected precedent transactions summarized above, no
public company utilized as a comparison is identical to
Intuitive Surgical or Computer Motion, and no transaction is
identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly
traded comparable companies and comparable business combinations
is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning the differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the companies and other factors
that could affect the public trading values or announced merger
transaction values, as the case maybe, of Intuitive Surgical or
Computer Motion and the companies to which they were compared.
The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which any securities may trade at the present time or
at any time in the future. In addition, the Bear Stearns opinion
was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors. Consequently, Bear
Stearns analysis should not be viewed as determinative of
the decision of Intuitive Surgicals board of directors or
Intuitive Surgicals management with respect to the
fairness of the exchange ratio as set forth in the merger
agreement.



Bear Stearns is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm and is continually engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements, leveraged buyouts and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes.

Bear Stearns was selected by the Intuitive
Surgical board of directors to render a fairness opinion because
of its expertise and its reputation in investment banking and
mergers and acquisitions and its familiarity with the medical
technology industry and Intuitive Surgical. Intuitive Surgical
and Bear Stearns have entered into a letter agreement, dated as
of February 27, 2003, relating to the services to be
provided by Bear Stearns in connection with the merger and the
transactions related to it, under which Intuitive Surgical
agreed to pay Bear Stearns a fee of $250,000 which was payable
upon rendering of their opinion. Intuitive Surgical also agreed
to reimburse Bear Stearns for certain out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the engagement. Intuitive Surgical
agreed that, for a two-year period it would offer Bear Stearns
the first opportunity to act as sole lead underwriter or agent
in financing transactions by Intuitive Surgical and as exclusive
financial advisor in merger or acquisition transactions
involving Intuitive Surgical on customary terms. In addition,
Intuitive Surgical agreed to indemnify Bear Stearns against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities law, relating to or arising out of its engagement.

Opinion of H.C. Wainwright to Computer
Motion

H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. has acted as
financial advisor to Computer Motion in connection with the
merger. As part of its engagement, H.C. Wainwright delivered its
oral opinion to Computer Motions board of directors at
that boards March 5, 2003 meeting that, as of that
date, and based upon and subject to various considerations set
forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio of shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock to be received in the merger by Computer
Motions stockholders for each share of Computer Motion
common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Computer Motions stockholders. H.C. Wainwright
subsequently confirmed its opinion in writing.

The full text of H.C. Wainwrights
written opinion, dated March 5, 2003, which sets forth,
among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and
review undertaken by H.C. Wainwright, is attached as Annex E to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein
by reference. Computer Motions stockholders are urged to
carefully read this opinion in its entirety. The summary of H.C.
Wainwrights opinion set forth in this document is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright,
among other things:

 

reviewed and analyzed publicly available
    financial statements for Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical
    and financial information made available to it by Computer
    Motions management;

 

analyzed internal financial statements, including
    financial projections and other financial and operating data
    prepared by Computer Motions management;

 

discussed with Computer Motions management,
    Computer Motions past, current and future prospects;

 

compared certain selected financial and stock
    market information for Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical
    with similar information for selected companies whose securities
    are publicly traded;

 

reviewed the financial terms of selected recent
    business combinations which it deemed comparable in whole or in
    part;

 

reviewed the merger agreement; and

 

performed those other studies and analyses and
    considered those other factors as it deemed appropriate.



In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright
assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other
information reviewed by it for the purposes of providing its
opinion, and did not assume any responsibility for independent
verification of that information. H.C. Wainwright did not assume
any responsibility for the independent valuation and appraisal
of any of Computer Motions assets and liabilities. With
respect to financial projections, H.C. Wainwright assumed that
they were reasonably prepared by Computer Motions
management on a basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Computer Motions future
financial performance. H.C. Wainwright expresses no view as to
those projections or the assumptions on which they were based.
H.C. Wainwrights opinion was necessarily based upon
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed
on the date of its opinion.

The projections furnished to H.C. Wainwright were
prepared by Computer Motions management. Computer Motion
does not publicly disclose internal management projections of
the type provided to H.C. Wainwright in connection with H.C.
Wainwrights analysis of the merger, and those projections
were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions
that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of
management, including, without limitation, factors related to
general economic and competitive conditions. Accordingly, actual
results could vary significantly from those set forth in those
projections.

Set forth below is a brief summary of certain
material financial analyses performed by H.C. Wainwright in
connection with its opinion and reviewed with Computer
Motions board of directors on March 5, 2003.

Historical Stock Price
    Analysis

H.C. Wainwright analyzed the price at which
Computer Motion common stock has traded at for the last
52 weeks. During that time period, Computer Motions
52 week high and low were $4.24 and $0.53 respectively. In
addition, the average closing price of Computer Motion common
stock over the same period was $1.53 and the closing price of
Computer Motion common stock at the date of the H.C. Wainwright
opinion was $1.41, or approximately 33% of its 52-week high.

Historical Exchange Ratio
    Analysis

H.C. Wainwright compared the historical exchange
ratio of the average closing price of Intuitive Surgical common
stock to the average closing price of Computer Motion common
stock over the various periods presented. The following table
sets forth the ratios of the average closing prices of Intuitive
Surgical common stock compared to Computer Motion common stock.

Selected Public Company Trading Valuation
    Analysis

H.C. Wainwright compared certain financial
information of Computer Motion with that of the following
selected companies involved in the medical device industry:

 

Rita Medical Systems, Inc.

 

CONMED Corporation

 

CardioDynamics International Corporation



 

Laserscope

 

Guidant Corporation

 

Boston Scientific Corporation

 

Stryker Corporation

 

Given Imaging Ltd.

H.C. Wainwright analyzed the relative performance
and value of Computer Motion by comparing certain selected
financial data of Computer Motion with that of the selected
companies, including multiples of:

(1) 

enterprise value (defined as market value plus
    debt plus preferred stock minus cash) as a multiple of revenue
    over the latest 12 months;

(2) 

enterprise value (defined as market value plus
    debt plus preferred stock minus cash) as a multiple of revenue
    during the most recent quarter annualized; and

(3) 

market value to book value.

To calculate the multiples, H.C. Wainwright used,
for the selected companies, publicly available historical
financial information, and, for Computer Motion, historical
financial information and projections provided by Computer
Motions management. The following table summarizes the
results of H.C. Wainwrights ratio analysis:

Based on the multiples for the selected companies
set forth in the table above and other customary valuation
methodologies utilized by H.C. Wainwright, H.C. Wainwright
developed relevant multiple ranges for each of these valuation
methods described in the table. Based on this information, H.C.
Wainwright estimated that the implied enterprise value for
Computer Motion in the merger based on this analysis was
approximately between $26.6 million and
$134.4 million. This compares to the transaction value of
approximately $78 million based on the closing price of
Intuitive Surgical common stock on March 5, 2003.

None of the selected companies are identical to
Computer Motion. Accordingly, H.C. Wainwright believes the
analysis of publicly traded comparable companies is not simply
mathematical in nature. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in H.C.
Wainwrights opinion, concerning differences in financial
and operating characteristics of the selected companies and
other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
selected companies.

Selected Precedent
    Transactions

H.C. Wainwright reviewed the financial terms, to
the extent publicly available, of seven announced, pending or
completed merger and acquisition transactions since
January 1, 2002, involving targets that were in the medical
technologies industry.

H.C. Wainwright compared the publicly available
statistics for the precedent transactions listed above to the
relevant financial statistics for the merger based on the
transaction value. The precedent transactions multiples compared
by H.C. Wainwright included, among other things, the mean and
median of the transaction value of the targets to the
targets revenue over the last twelve months. The following
table summarizes the results of these analyses:

Based on the multiples for the transactions set
forth in the table above and other customary valuation
methodologies utilized by H.C. Wainwright, H.C. Wainwright
estimated that the implied enterprise value for Computer Motion
in the merger based on the analysis was between
$292 million and $124 million. This compares to the
transaction value of approximately $78 million based on the
closing price of Intuitive Surgical common stock on
March 5, 2003.

Because the reasons for, and circumstances
surrounding, each of the precedent transactions analyzed were so
diverse, and due to the inherent differences between Computer
Motions operations and financial condition and those of
the companies involved in these medical technologies
transactions, H.C. Wainwright believes that a comparable
transaction analysis is not simply mathematical in nature.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
qualitative judgments, reflected in H.C. Wainwrights
opinion, concerning differences between the characteristics of
these prior transactions and the merger that could affect the
value of the these companies and businesses and Computer Motion.

All multiples for these medical technologies
transactions are based on public information available at the
time of announcement of that transaction, without taking into
account differing market and other conditions during the period
which these medical technologies transactions occurred.

Transaction Premium Analysis.

H.C. Wainwright also analyzed, as publicly
available, the announced transaction premium/discount to the
market value for the selected transactions. The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

Because the reasons for, and circumstances
surrounding, each of the precedent transactions analyzed were so
diverse, and due to the inherent differences between Computer
Motions operations and financial condition and those of
the companies involved in these medical technologies
transactions, H.C. Wainwright



believes that a comparable transaction analysis
is not simply mathematical in nature. Rather, this analysis
involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments,
reflected in H.C. Wainwrights opinion, concerning
differences between the characteristics of these prior
transactions and the merger that could affect the value of the
these companies and businesses and Computer Motion.

In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright
performed a variety of financial analyses, the material portions
of which are summarized above. The summary set forth above does
not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by H.C. Wainwright or of H.C. Wainwrights
presentation to Computer Motions board of directors. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical
process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, the opinion is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, H.C. Wainwright did not attribute any particular weight
to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor. Accordingly, H.C. Wainwright
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors
considered by it, without considering all of the analyses and
factors, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses set forth in its opinion.

H.C. Wainwrights opinion does not imply any
conclusion as to the likely trading range for Intuitive
Surgicals common stock after the date of its opinion or
when issued to Computer Motions stockholders in the
merger. In performing its analyses, H.C. Wainwright made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Computer
Motion and Intuitive Surgical. Any estimates contained in those
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual past or future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less than
those estimates. Actual values will depend upon several factors,
including changes in interest rates, market conditions, general
economic conditions and other factors that generally influence
the price of securities.

The terms of the merger were determined through
negotiations between Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical and
were approved by Computer Motions board of directors.
Although H.C. Wainwright provided advice to Computer Motion
during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter
into the merger was solely that of Computer Motions board
of directors. As described above, the opinion and presentation
of H.C. Wainwright to Computer Motions board of
directors were only one of a number of factors taken into
consideration by Computer Motions board of directors in
making its determination to approve the merger.
H.C. Wainwrights opinion does not address the merits
of the underlying decision by Computer Motion to enter into the
merger agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how that stockholder
should vote.

Computer Motion selected H.C. Wainwright as
its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on
H.C. Wainwrights qualifications, expertise,
reputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions. Computer
Motion originally retained H.C. Wainwright pursuant to a
letter agreement, dated January 17, 2002, as supplemented
by a separate letter agreement with respect to the merger, dated
March 5, 2003. Under the March 5, 2003 letter
agreement, Computer Motion agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright a
financial advisory fee of $50,000 in connection with
H.C. Wainwrights advisory services and to render its
opinion. Computer Motion also agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright
$50,000 upon filing of the S-4 and $50,000 upon stockholder
approval of the merger for H.C. Wainwrights advisory
services. H.C. Wainwright was also issued 100,000 warrants
exercisable at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for its
advisory services that will become exercisable upon completion
of the merger.

Regardless of whether the merger is consummated,
subject to the approval by Computer Motion in certain instances,
Computer Motion has agreed to reimburse H.C. Wainwright for
fees and disbursements of H.C. Wainwrights counsel
and for H.C. Wainwrights travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger.
Computer Motion has also agreed to indemnify
H.C. Wainwright and



certain related persons to the full extent lawful
against various liabilities, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws arising out of its engagement or the
merger.

H.C. Wainwright is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing
advice in connection with merger and acquisitions and related
transactions. In the ordinary course of its business,
H.C. Wainwright may effect transactions, for its own
account or for the account of customers, and hold at any time a
long or short position in securities of Computer Motion or
Intuitive Surgical.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the
Merger

Under the merger agreement, both Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion have agreed to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain all required governmental approvals and
avoid any action or proceeding by a governmental entity in
connection with the execution of the merger agreement and
completion of the merger. Neither Intuitive Surgical nor
Computer Motion is aware, however, of any material federal or
state regulatory requirements or approvals required for the
execution of the merger agreement or completion of the merger,
other than filing a certificate of merger in Delaware at or
before the effective time of the merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences

The following discussion describes the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to
Computer Motion stockholders as a result of the exchange of
their shares of Computer Motion common or preferred stock for
Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the merger and is
based on the opinion of Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth,
counsel to Computer Motion. This discussion is based on existing
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
existing and proposed Treasury regulations and current
administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are
subject to change. Any such change, which may or may not be
retroactive, could alter the tax consequences described below.

Computer Motion stockholders should be aware that
this summary does not deal with all federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular Computer
Motion stockholders in light of their particular circumstances.
In particular, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences to Computer Motion stockholders who are foreign
persons, who are financial institutions, who are dealers in
securities, who are insurance companies, who are tax-exempt
entities, who are subject to the alternative minimum tax
provisions of the Code, who do not hold their Computer Motion
stock as a capital asset, who acquired their Computer Motion
common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options
or otherwise as compensation, or who hold Computer Motion stock
as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction. In
addition, the following discussion does not address the tax
consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax
laws, the tax consequences of transactions effected prior or
subsequent to, or concurrently with, the merger, whether or not
any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the
merger, including, without limitation, any transaction in which
shares of Computer Motion stock are acquired or shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock are disposed of, or the tax
consequences of the assumption by Intuitive Surgical of the
Computer Motion options or the tax consequences of the receipt
of rights to acquire Intuitive Surgical common stock. The
following discussion also does not address the tax consequences
to holders of Computer Motion preferred stock relating to any
adjustments in the number of shares of Computer Motion common
stock that will be issuable upon conversion of their preferred
stock. For more information regarding the conversion ratio of
the Computer Motion preferred stock, see The Merger
Agreement  The Merger Consideration and Conversion of
Securities.

COMPUTER MOTION URGES EACH COMPUTER MOTION
STOCKHOLDER TO CONSULT SUCH STOCKHOLDERS OWN TAX ADVISOR
AS TO THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, AND
ALSO AS TO ANY STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES,
BASED ON SUCH STOCKHOLDERS OWN PARTICULAR FACTS AND
CIRCUMSTANCES.



The merger is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth
below, the merger generally will result in the following
U.S. federal income tax consequences:

 

the merger will qualify as a reorganization
    within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;

 

neither Computer Motion, Intuitive Surgical nor
    Intuitive Merger Corporation will recognize any income, gain or
    loss as a result of the completion of the merger;

 

the holders of Computer Motion stock will not
    recognize a gain or loss upon the exchange of Computer Motion
    stock for Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant to the
    merger, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of a
    fractional share of Computer Motion stock, as described below;

 

the aggregate tax basis of the Intuitive Surgical
    common stock received by Computer Motion stockholders in the
    merger, reduced by any tax basis attributable to fractional
    shares deemed to be disposed of, will be the same as the
    aggregate tax basis of the Computer Motion stock surrendered in
    exchange therefor;

 

the holding period of the Intuitive Surgical
    common stock received by each Computer Motion stockholder
    pursuant to the merger will include the period during which the
    stock surrendered in exchange therefor was held by such Computer
    Motion stockholder, 
provided 
the Computer Motion stock so
    surrendered is a capital asset in the hands of the Computer
    Motion stockholder at the time of the merger; and

 

cash payments received by holders of Computer
    Motion stock in lieu of a fractional share of Intuitive Surgical
    common stock generally will be treated as if the fractional
    share of Intuitive Surgical common stock had been issued in the
    merger and then redeemed by Intuitive Surgical. A Computer
    Motion stockholder receiving cash in lieu of a fractional share
    will recognize gain or loss upon the payment measured by the
    difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the
    basis in the fractional share.

The parties have not requested and will not
request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the
tax consequences of the merger. Stradling Yocca Carlson &
Rauth, a Professional Corporation, has delivered an opinion to
Computer Motion regarding the federal income tax consequences of
the merger described above. However, Computer Motion
stockholders should be aware that opinions of counsel are not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and the
Internal Revenue Service is therefore not precluded from
asserting a contrary opinion. The tax opinion is subject to
assumptions, covenants and qualifications, including but not
limited to the truth and accuracy of certain representations,
including those contained in certificates of officers of
Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical, without any independent
verification. In particular, the opinion assumes that any loans
made by Intuitive Surgical pursuant to the Loan and Security
Agreement will be treated as debt and not an equity interest in
Computer Motion under federal income tax principles. If any of
such representations, qualifications, covenants or assumptions
mentioned above is inaccurate, or if any change in fact or law
occurs, then the tax consequences of the merger could differ
from those described above. Nevertheless, Computer Motion,
Intuitive Surgical and Intuitive Merger Corporation have agreed
in the merger agreement that each intends that the merger
qualify as a reorganization and that each will treat and report
the merger as such.

A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge
to the reorganization status of the merger would result in
Computer Motion stockholders recognizing taxable gain or loss
with respect to each share of Computer Motion common or
preferred stock surrendered equal to the difference between the
stockholders basis in that share and the fair market
value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the Intuitive
Surgical common stock received in the exchange. In that event, a
stockholders aggregate basis in the Intuitive Surgical
common stock received would equal its fair market value, and the
stockholders holding period for that stock would begin the
day after the merger.



Accounting Treatment

In accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, Intuitive Surgical will
account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting.
Under this method of accounting, Intuitive Surgical will record
the market value (based on an average of the closing prices of
Intuitive Surgical common stock for a range of trading days from
two days before and after March 20, 2003, the announcement
date) of its common stock issued in the merger, the fair value
of Intuitive Surgical options and warrants issued in exchange
for the options and warrants to purchase shares of Computer
Motion common and preferred stock and the amount of direct
transaction costs associated with the merger as the estimated
purchase price of acquiring Computer Motion. Intuitive Surgical
will allocate the estimated purchase price to the net tangible
and amortizable intangible assets acquired (primarily developed
technology, core technology and in-process research and
development), based on their respective fair values at the date
of the completion of the merger. Any excess of the estimated
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired will
be accounted for as goodwill.

Amortizable intangible assets, currently
estimated at $28.6 million, will generally be amortized
over useful lives ranging from four to seven years.
In-process research and development, which is currently
estimated at $4.2 million, will be expensed during the
fiscal quarter in which the merger is completed. In accordance
with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
goodwill resulting from the business combination of
$48.1 million will not be amortized but instead will be
tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if
certain indicators are present).

In the event that Intuitive Surgicals
management determines that the value of goodwill has become
impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge
for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which
the determination is made. The amounts listed in the above
paragraph are only preliminary estimates, however, actual
amounts may differ from these estimates.

Listing of Intuitive Surgical Common
Stock

Intuitive Surgical will use reasonable best
efforts to:

 

cause the shares of Intuitive Surgical common
    stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for listing on
    the Nasdaq National Market prior to the completion of the
    merger; and

 

cause the shares of Intuitive Surgical common
    stock to be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of converted
    Computer Motion stock options and warrants to be approved for
    listing on the Nasdaq National Market prior to the completion of
    the merger.

Delisting and Deregistration of Computer
Motion Common Stock

If the merger is completed, Computer Motion
common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market
and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Computer Motion will no longer file periodic reports with the
SEC.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares of Intuitive
Surgical Common Stock Received in the Merger

The shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock to
be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable, except for shares
of Intuitive Surgical common stock issued to any person who is
deemed to be an affiliate of Computer Motion prior
to the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates of Computer Motion prior to the merger
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control of Computer Motion prior to the
merger, and may include officers and directors, as well as
significant stockholders of Computer Motion



prior to the merger. Affiliates of Computer
Motion prior to the merger may not sell any of the shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock received by them in connection
with the merger except pursuant to:

 

an effective registration statement under the
    Securities Act of 1933 covering the resale of those shares;

 

an exemption under paragraph (d) of
    Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933; or

 

any other applicable exemption under the
    Securities Act of 1933.

Intuitive Surgicals registration statement
on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Intuitive
Surgical common stock to be received by affiliates of Computer
Motion in the merger.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers
of Computer Motion in the Merger

Some members of Computer Motions management
and board of directors have interests in the merger that are in
addition to or different from their interests as Computer Motion
stockholders. The Computer Motion board of directors was aware
of these interests and considered them in approving the merger
agreement and the merger.

Governance Structure and Management
    Positions

The merger agreement provides for the initial
composition of the board of directors and selected executive
officer positions for Intuitive Surgical after completion of the
merger. Please see Management and Operations Following the
Merger.

Indemnification; Directors and
    Officers Insurance

Intuitive Surgical has agreed to cause to be
maintained charter and bylaw provisions with respect to
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those contained in
charter and bylaws of Computer Motion as in effect on the date
of the merger agreement. Intuitive Surgical has also agreed to
provide, for six years after the merger, directors and
officers liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the merger covering each person
currently covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance policy of Computer Motion on terms and in
amounts no less favorable than those of the policies of Computer
Motion.

Severance Agreements and Other
    Arrangements

In January 2002, Computer Motion entered into a
letter agreement with Eugene W. Teal, Executive Vice President,
which provides for an annual base salary of $160,000 and a
target bonus percentage of 50% of annual base salary.
Mr. Teals bonus was guaranteed for the first year of
his employment, which began on January 23, 2002. The letter
agreement also guarantees payment of Mr. Teals base
salary for a two-year period. In addition, the letter agreement
provides that in the event Computer Motion is acquired or
experiences a change in control, Mr. Teal is guaranteed
payment of his base salary through January 22, 2005.

In June 2002, Computer Motion entered into a
letter agreement with Joseph M. DeVivo, President and Chief
Operating Officer, which provides for an annual base salary of
$220,000 and a bonus of up to 90% of annual base salary. The
letter agreement guarantees payment of Mr. DeVivos
base salary and a 90% bonus for a one-year period. In addition,
in the event Mr. DeVivo terminates his employment for any
reason following 90 days after Computer Motion is acquired
or experiences a change in control, or if Computer Motion
terminates Mr. DeVivo for any reason other than for cause
after one year of service, Mr. DeVivo is guaranteed payment
of his base salary for a one-year period thereafter.



Stock Option Plans

As of March 21, 2003, executive officers and
directors of Computer Motion owned options to purchase an
aggregate of 1,862,999 shares of Computer Motion common stock at
a weighted average exercise price of $4.92 per share. Of this
amount, options to purchase an aggregate of 1,522,960 shares of
Computer Motion common stock will automatically vest and become
immediately exercisable in full upon completion of the merger.
Intuitive Surgical will assume all unexercised Computer Motion
options in the merger. Please see The Merger 
General.

Preferred Stock Exchange

On March 6, 2003, all holders of Computer
Motions Series C convertible preferred stock agreed
with Computer Motion to exchange their shares of preferred stock
for newly-issued shares of Series D convertible preferred
stock. These holders included Robert W. Duggan, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Computer Motion, who held 1,091
shares of preferred stock, Joseph M. DeVivo, the President and
Chief Operating Officer of Computer Motion, who held 100 shares
of preferred stock, and St. Cloud Capital Partners LP,
which held 1,071 shares of preferred stock. St. Cloud
Capital Partners LP is affiliated with Robert W. Lautz who
was a director of Computer Motion at the time the merger
agreement was approved, and who resigned as a director on
March 21, 2003.

The terms of the Series D convertible
preferred stock eliminate certain provisions that were contained
in the terms of the Series C convertible preferred stock
that could have restricted the ability of Computer Motion to
enter into the merger agreement. Instead, the terms of the
Series D convertible preferred stock provide that holders
of the Series D convertible preferred stock will vote
together with the holders of common stock of Computer Motion on
the proposed merger. Holders of Series D convertible
preferred stock will be entitled to 1,000 votes per share,
representing the original conversion ratio of the Series C
convertible preferred stock upon its initial issuance.

In addition, the Series D convertible
preferred stock contains revised conversion rights in connection
with the merger. Like the Series C convertible preferred
stock, the Series D convertible preferred stock will
convert into shares of Computer Motion common stock immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger. The Computer Motion
common stock will then be exchanged for Intuitive Surgical
common stock based on the merger exchange ratio. The terms of
the Series D convertible preferred stock permit holders to
choose to convert their shares at the regular fixed conversion
ratio (approximately 1,014.5 to 1) or, in connection with a
change of control transaction such as the merger, at an
alternative floating conversion ratio that would return at least
135% of the original purchase price of the Series C
convertible preferred stock. Under either conversion ratio, the
holders of Series D convertible preferred stock are also
entitled to receive accrued dividends. For purposes of the
alternative conversion ratio, the return is calculated based on
the average closing bid price of Computer Motions common
stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
15 days prior to the special meeting, which is referred to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the pricing period.
However, a floor price of $1.38 per share is set by the terms of
the Series D convertible preferred stock, so that the
alternative conversion ratio cannot exceed 135% of the regular
conversion ratio. The alternative conversion ratio may be higher
than the regular conversion ratio if the average closing bid
price of Computer Motions common stock falls below
approximately $1.86 during the pricing period. Each
Series D stockholder must elect such alternative conversion
ratio by delivering a notice to Computer Motion no later than 12
trading days prior to the date of the special meeting. The
shares held by any holder who does not make such election will
convert into Computer Motion common stock at the regular
conversion ratio immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger.

Like the Series C convertible preferred
stock, the Series D convertible preferred stock accrues
dividends which may be paid at the election of Computer Motion
either in cash or in shares of Computer Motion common stock,
except for 1,071 shares of Series D convertible preferred
stock held by St. Cloud Capital Partners LP, on which cash
dividends must be paid. Dividends are payable semi-annually,
starting with the first dividend payment date on April 30,
2003. Computer Motion common stock issued in payment of these
dividends is valued at 90% of its volume-weighted average price
as reported by



Bloomberg for the 20 trading days immediately
prior to the dividend payment date. It is expected that
dividends due on April 30, 2003 (except for the cash
dividend due to St. Cloud Capital Partners LP) will be paid by
issuance of additional shares of Computer Motion common stock.
Dividends which accrue from April 30, 2003 to the
conversion of the Series D convertible preferred stock
immediately prior to the effective time will be paid by issuance
of additional shares of Computer Motion common stock upon
conversion. For this purpose, holders of Series D
convertible preferred stock who elect the alternative conversion
ratio described above (including St. Cloud Capital Partners
LP) will receive additional shares of Computer Motion common
stock valued at 100% of the average closing bid price of
Computer Motions common stock during the pricing period
(but the value so ascribed to the common stock will not be less
than $1.38). Common stock issuable in payment of dividends to
holders electing the regular conversion ratio will be valued at
the 90% rate described above which is applicable to regular
dividend payments.

As an inducement to holders to exchange their
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, Computer
Motion agreed to reduce the exercise price on outstanding common
stock purchase warrants held by the holders of Series C
convertible preferred stock. The exercise price on one series of
warrants to acquire 1,759,345 shares was reduced from $1.78 to
$1.50 per share, and on another series of warrants to acquire
1,759,345 shares, from $2.17 to $1.50 per share. The reduced
exercise price is conditioned on the exercise of the warrants
prior to 10 days following the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus.

As a further inducement to exchange its shares of
Series C convertible preferred stock, Computer Motion has
agreed that, if the merger is completed prior to
September 30, 2003, it will pay St. Cloud Capital
Partners LP a fee equal to $119,952 less the amount of any cash
dividends that St. Cloud receives on account of shares of
Series D convertible preferred stock held by it. This
payment is to be made prior to the effective time of the merger.

Computer Motion has agreed that, if the merger is
not completed by September 30, 2003, holders may exchange
their Series D convertible preferred stock for a like
number of shares of Series E convertible preferred stock
having rights and preferences identical to the former
Series C convertible preferred stock.

Management and Operations Following the
Merger

Intuitive Surgical expects that, initially
following completion of the merger, the businesses and
operations of Computer Motion will, except as described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, be continued substantially as
they are currently being conducted. Intuitive Surgical intends
to undertake a comprehensive review of the business, operations,
capitalization and management of Computer Motion with a view to
optimizing development of its potential in conjunction with
Intuitive Surgicals business.

Upon completion of the merger, the board of
directors of Intuitive Surgical will be expanded to add two
additional members for a total of nine directors. The two
additional members of Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors are expected to be as follows:

 

Robert Duggan has been Chairman of the Board of
    Directors of Computer Motion since 1990 and Chief Executive
    Officer since 1997. Mr. Duggan has been a private venture
    investor for more than 25 years, and has participated as a
    director of, investor in and advisor to numerous small and large
    businesses in the medical equipment, computer local and wide
    area networks, PC hardware and software distribution, digital
    encryption, consumer retail goods and outdoor media
    communications industries. He has also assisted in corporate
    planning, capital formation and management for his various
    investments. He is a member of the University of California at
    Santa Barbara Foundation Board of Trustees, as well as the
    Universitys Engineering Steering Committee.

 

Eric H. Halvorson joined Computer Motion in July
    2002 as a member of the board of directors. Mr. Halvorson
    is currently a Visiting Professor of Business Law and Accounting
    at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, where he
    instructs classes in the Legal and Regulatory Environment of
    Business and Financial Accounting. Previously, he was the
    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Salem
    Communications Corporation from 1995-2000.



Prior to becoming the Chief Operating Officer of
    Salem Communications, Mr. Halvorson was Vice President and
    General Counsel for ten years. From 1976 until 1985, he was a
    partner at Godfrey and Kahn, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin based law
    firm. Mr. Halvorson is a Certified Public Accountant and
    holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from Bob Jones
    University and a Juris Doctor degree from Duke University School
    of Law. Mr. Halvorson is currently a director of Salem
    Communications Corp. and Media Arts Group, Inc. At Computer
    Motion, he serves on the audit and compensation committees of
    the board of directors.

It is currently expected that Mr. Duggan
will be a Class II director continuing in office until
Intuitive Surgicals 2005 annual meeting of stockholders
and that Mr. Halvorson will be a Class I director
continuing in office until Intuitive Surgicals 2004 annual
meeting of stockholders.

The executive officers of Intuitive Surgical are
expected to continue in their current roles upon completion of
the merger. In addition, Joseph M. DeVivo is expected to be
appointed as Intuitive Surgicals Senior Vice President,
Marketing and Darrin R. Uecker is expected to be appointed as
Intuitive Surgicals Vice President and Chief Technical
Officer.



THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes certain
material provisions of the merger agreement, which is included
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and is
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the
information about the merger agreement that is important to you.
We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully in its
entirety.

Effective Time of the Merger and Effect of the
Merger

The merger will become effective upon the filing
of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of the State of
Delaware or at such later time as is specified in the
certificate of merger, which is referred to as the effective
time of the merger. At the effective time of the merger,
Intuitive Merger Corporation (formerly Iron Acquisition
Corporation), a newly formed subsidiary of Intuitive Surgical,
will merge with and into Computer Motion and the separate
corporate existence of Intuitive Merger Corporation will cease.
Computer Motion will be the surviving corporation in the merger
and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive
Surgical.

The Merger Consideration and Conversion of
Securities

General

Upon completion of the merger, each share of
Computer Motion common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger will automatically be
converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of
Intuitive Surgical common stock equal to the exchange ratio (as
described below). All shares of Computer Motion Series D
convertible preferred stock will be converted into shares of
Computer Motion common stock immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.

Exchange Ratio

The exchange ratio will be determined pursuant to
a formula based on the total number of fully diluted shares of
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. Computer Motions fully
diluted share count will vary based upon the number of shares of
Computer Motion common stock into which Computer Motions
Series D convertible preferred stock is convertible and the
number of shares of Computer Motion common stock which may be
issued to pay accrued dividends on the Series D convertible
preferred stock upon conversion. All shares of Computer Motion
Series D convertible preferred stock will convert into
shares of Computer Motion common stock immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. The holders of the Series D
convertible preferred stock can choose between two conversion
ratios: a fixed ratio or a floating ratio that varies inversely
based on the average of the closing bid prices of Computer
Motions common stock for the 20 consecutive trading
days ending 15 days prior to the Computer Motion special
meeting, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the pricing period. An increase in the
number of shares of Computer Motion common stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series D convertible preferred stock will
decrease the exchange ratio applicable to the Computer Motion
common stock. As a result, the exchange ratio in the merger may
decrease and, therefore, Computer Motion common stockholders
would receive a lesser number of Intuitive Surgical shares, and
Computer Motion preferred stockholders would receive a greater
number of Intuitive Surgical shares, in the merger. The
anticipated exchange ratio for Computer Motion common stock,
based on the number of fully diluted shares of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion expected to be outstanding on an
assumed closing date of June 20, 2003, will range from
approximately 0.48 to 0.52 depending on the average closing bid
prices per share of Computer Motion common stock during the
pricing period.
After                     ,
2003, stockholders may visit Intuitive Surgicals website,

www.intuitivesurgical.com
, or Computer Motions
website, 
www.computermotion.com
, for announcements
regarding the exchange ratio.

The number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common
stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend or similar event with



respect to shares of Intuitive Surgical common
stock or Computer Motion common stock effected between the date
of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger,
including the proposed 1-for-2 reverse stock split described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see
Amendment of Intuitive Surgicals Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

Promptly after completion of the merger,
Intuitive Surgicals transfer agent will mail to former
Computer Motion stockholders a letter of transmittal and
instructions to be used in surrendering certificates which
represented shares of Computer Motion common stock prior to the
effective time of the merger. When a former Computer Motion
stockholder delivers these certificates to the exchange agent
along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any
other required documents, the former Computer Motion stockholder
will receive Intuitive Surgical stock certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock to
which the stockholder is entitled under the merger agreement and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock.

Treatment of Computer Motion Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock

All shares of Computer Motion Series D
convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of Computer
Motion common stock immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger. The Computer Motion common stock will then be
exchanged for Intuitive Surgical common stock based on the
exchange ratio in the merger.

The regular conversion ratio under the
Series D convertible preferred stock is fixed at
approximately 1,014.5 to 1. However, under the terms of the
Series D convertible preferred stock, in connection with a
change of control transaction such as the merger, the holders
may choose an alternative floating ratio that would return at
least 135% of the original purchase price of the Series C
convertible preferred stock. Under either conversion ratio, the
holders of Series D convertible preferred stock are also
entitled to receive accrued dividends. For purposes of the
alternative ratio, the return is calculated based on the average
closing bid price of Computer Motions common stock for the
20 consecutive trading days ending 15 days prior to
the special meeting, which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the pricing period. A floor price of
$1.38 per share is set by the terms of the Series D
convertible preferred stock, so that the alternative conversion
ratio cannot exceed 135% of the regular conversion ratio. The
alternative conversion ratio may be higher than the regular
conversion ratio if the average price of Computer Motions
common stock falls below $1.86 during the pricing period. Each
holder of Series D convertible preferred stock must elect
such alternative conversion ratio by delivering a notice to
Computer Motion no later than 12 trading days prior to the date
of the special meeting. The shares held by any holder that does
not make such election will convert into Computer Motion common
stock at the regular conversion ratio immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger.

In addition, the Series D convertible
preferred stock accrues dividends which generally may be paid at
the election of Computer Motion either in cash or in shares of
Computer Motion common stock. Dividends are payable
semi-annually, starting with the first dividend payment date on
April 30, 2003. Computer Motion common stock issued in
payment of these dividends is valued at 90% of its
volume-weighted average price as reported by Bloomberg for the
20 trading days immediately prior to the dividend payment date.
It is expected that dividends due on April 30, 2003 (except
for the cash dividend which must be paid to St. Cloud) will
be paid by issuance of additional shares of Computer Motion
common stock. Dividends which accrue from April 30, 2003 to
the conversion of the Series D convertible preferred stock
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
paid by issuance of additional shares of Computer Motion common
stock upon conversion. For this purpose, holders of
Series D convertible preferred stock who elect the
alternative conversion ratio described above (including
St. Cloud) will receive additional shares of Computer
Motion common stock valued at 100% of the average closing bid
price of Computer Motions common stock during the pricing
period (but the value so ascribed to the Computer Motion common
stock will not be less than $1.38 per share). Computer Motion
common stock issuable in payment of dividends to holders
electing the regular conversion ratio will be valued at the 90%
rate described above which is applicable to regular dividend
payments.



Treatment of Computer Motion Stock Options and
Warrants

Upon the effective time of the merger, Intuitive
Surgical will assume all options and warrants to purchase
Computer Motion stock then outstanding under option and warrant
agreements and Computer Motions stock option plans.
Substantially all of the Computer Motion options that are
outstanding at the effective time of the merger will accelerate
and become immediately exercisable prior to the effective time
of the merger. After the effective time of the merger, each
option and warrant will represent the right to purchase that
number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock equal to the
number of shares of Computer Motion common stock covered by such
option or warrant immediately before the effective time of the
merger multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of Intuitive
Surgical common stock subject to each option or warrant will
equal the pre-conversion price per share of Computer Motion
common stock subject to such option or warrant divided by the
exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Effective upon the execution of the merger
agreement, Computer Motions board of directors took action
under Computer Motions employee stock purchase plan to
provide that:

 

participants are permitted to increase their
    payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on
    the date of the merger agreement;

 

no offering period will be commenced after the
    date of the merger agreement; and

 

each participants outstanding right to
    purchase shares of Computer Motions common stock under the
    plan will terminate on the day immediately prior to the date on
    which the merger is completed, with all amounts allocated for
    each participants account under the employee stock
    purchase plan as of the termination date being used to purchase
    shares of Computer Motion common stock at the applicable
    discount to the market price of Computer Motions common
    stock pursuant to the plan, using the termination date as the
    final purchase date for each then outstanding offering period.

completion of the merger, all such claims will be dismissed with
prejudice. If the merger is not completed, the stays may be
lifted and the proceedings continued.

No Solicitation of Other Transactions by
Computer Motion

The merger agreement provides that Computer
Motion will not through any representatives or otherwise:

 

encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate any
    acquisition proposal (as defined below);

 

enter into any agreement with respect to any
    acquisition proposal or enter into any agreement requiring it to
    abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
    contemplated by the merger agreement; or

 

participate in any discussions or negotiations
    with, or furnish any information to, another party that may
    reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;



provided, however
,
that if, at any time prior to the obtaining of Computer Motion
stockholders approval of the merger agreement, Computer
Motions board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failing to consider an
unsolicited acquisition proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties, Computer Motion may furnish information to,
and participate in discussions with, a person making a superior
proposal. Any information that is furnished to another party
that has made a superior proposal will be provided pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement no more favorable to the other party
than the confidentiality agreement in place between Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion.

In addition, Computer Motion has agreed that the
Computer Motion board of directors will not, except in the case
of a superior proposal, withdraw or modify its approval and
recommendation of the approval of the merger agreement, approve
or recommend any other acquisition proposal, or cause Computer
Motion to enter into any letter of intent or agreement related
to any other acquisition proposal.

The merger agreement defines an acquisition
proposal as any offer or proposal concerning the following:

 

a merger, consolidation, business combination, or
    similar transaction involving Computer Motion;

 

a sale, lease or other disposition of more than
    20% of Computer Motions assets;

 

the issuance, sale or other disposition of
    securities representing more than 20% of the voting power of
    Computer Motion;

 

any transaction in which any person or group of
    persons acquires beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
    beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the outstanding voting
    capital stock of Computer Motion; or

 

any combination of the foregoing.

The merger agreement defines a superior proposal
as a bona fide acquisition proposal involving a merger of
Computer Motion or the sale, lease or other transfer of 20% or
more of Computer Motions assets, voting power or capital
stock made by a third party that was not solicited by Computer
Motion or its affiliates or representatives and which, in the
good faith judgment of Computer Motions board of directors:

 

if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
    completed; and

 

if completed, based on a written opinion of
    Computer Motions financial advisor, would result in a
    transaction that is more favorable to Computer Motions
    stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the
    transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
DATA

OF INTUITIVE SURGICAL AND COMPUTER
MOTION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002
and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002 are based on the historical financial statements of
Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion after giving effect to
the merger as a purchase of Computer Motion by Intuitive
Surgical using the purchase method of accounting and the
assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes
to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated
financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet
gives effect to the merger of Intuitive Surgical and Computer
Motion as if it had occurred of December 31, 2002. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of
operations gives effect to the proposed merger of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion as if it had occurred on
January 1, 2002. The pro forma information is based on the
historical, audited consolidated financial statements of
Intuitive Surgical, the audited consolidated financial
statements of Computer Motion, and the assumptions, estimates,
and adjustments described in the notes to the unaudited pro
forma condensed combining financial statements. The assumptions,
estimates, and adjustments are preliminary and have been made
solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the
total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in
Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements, is allocated to the net
tangible and intangible assets of Computer Motion acquired in
connection with the merger, based on their fair values as of the
completion of the merger. A preliminary valuation was conducted
in order to assist management of Intuitive Surgical in
determining the fair values of a significant portion of these
assets. This preliminary valuation has been considered in
managements estimates of the fair values reflected in
these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated
financial statements. A final determination of these fair
values, which cannot be made prior to the completion of the
merger, will include managements consideration of a final
valuation. This final valuation will be based on the actual net
tangible and intangible assets of Computer Motion that exist as
of the date of completion of the merger.

Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments for liabilities resulting from integration planning,
as management is in the process of making these assessments and
estimates of these costs are not currently known. However,
liabilities ultimately will be recorded for severance or other
costs associated with removing redundant operations that would
affect amounts in the pro forma financial statements.

These unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on
preliminary estimates of fair values. Amounts allocated to
intangible assets may increase significantly, which could result
in a material increase in amortization of intangible assets.
Therefore, the actual amounts recorded as of the completion of
the merger may differ materially from the information presented
in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated
financial statements. The impact of ongoing integration
activities, the timing of completion of the merger, and other
changes in Computer Motions net tangible and intangible
assets, which occur prior to completion of the merger, as well
as the receipt of the final valuation, could cause material
differences in the information presented.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the historical audited consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/
prospectus, and the summary of selected historical consolidated
financial data included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements are not intended to represent
or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or
financial condition of Intuitive Surgical that would have been
reported had the merger been completed as of the dates
presented, and should not be taken as representative of the

COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1

Basis of Pro Forma
    Presentation

On March 7, 2003, Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion entered into an agreement and plan of merger,
which upon completion will result in Computer Motion becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive Surgical in a transaction
to be accounted for using the purchase method. For a discussion
regarding the primary reasons for the merger, please see
Reasons for the Merger  Intuitive
Surgical and Reasons for the Merger 
Computer Motion. The total estimated purchase price of
approximately $94.9 million includes Intuitive Surgical
common stock valued at $79.3 million, assumed options and
warrants with a fair value of $13.6 million and estimated
direct transaction costs of $2.0 million.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements provide for the issuance of
approximately 15.1 million shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock, based upon an assumed exchange ratio of 0.48 of a
share of Intuitive Surgical common stock for each outstanding
share of Computer Motion common stock as of December 31,
2002. This assumed exchange ratio is based on a measurement date
of March 20, 2003 for the merger.

The actual fraction of a share of Intuitive
Surgical common stock into which each share of Computer Motion
common stock will be converted, or the exchange ratio, will be
determined based on the total number of fully diluted shares
outstanding for Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
immediately prior to completion of the merger. The number of
Computer Motions fully diluted shares may vary based upon
the number of shares of common stock into which Computer
Motions preferred stock will be convertible and the number
of shares of Computer Motion common stock which may be issued to
pay accrued dividends on the preferred stock upon conversion.
This preferred stock conversion ratio will, in turn, vary
inversely based upon the average closing bid price for Computer
Motion common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
15 days prior to the Computer Motion special meeting, which
is referred to herein as the pricing period. As a result, the
measurement date for the merger is expected to be the completion
date of the merger. Based on an estimated completion date of
June 20, 2003, the anticipated exchange ratio for Computer
Motion common stock could range from approximately 0.48 to 0.52
depending on the average closing bid price per share of Computer
Motion common stock during the pricing period.

While the preferred stock conversion ratio and
the merger exchange ratio may change based on the foregoing
factors, the percentage of shares of the combined company to be
issued to holders of Computer Motion stock, warrants and options
on a fully diluted basis is fixed at 32% in the merger agreement.

The average market price per share of Intuitive
Surgical common stock of $5.24 is based on an average of the
closing prices for two days before, the day of, and two days
after the assumed measurement date of March 20, 2003
(March 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 24th).

Based on the total number of Computer Motion
options and warrants outstanding at March 21, 2003,
Intuitive Surgical will assume options and warrants of Computer
Motion entitling the holders to purchase approximately
5.9 million shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $6.59 per share. The actual
number of options, both vested and unvested, and warrants to be
assumed will be determined based on the actual number of
Computer Motion options and warrants outstanding at the
effective time of the merger. The fair value of the outstanding
options, both vested and unvested, and warrants was determined
using a Black-Scholes valuation model with the following
assumptions: no dividend yield; a weighted average expected
volatility of 74%; and a risk-free interest rate of 1.9%. The
model assumed a weighted average expected life of 1.6 years
for assumed options and 4 years for assumed warrants.



The estimated total purchase price of Computer
Motion in the merger is as follows (in thousands):

The vested warrants and options and the unvested
    options were valued using Black-Scholes valuation model.

In connection with the merger, Intuitive Surgical
has agreed to provide a short-term, secured bridge loan facility
of up to a maximum of $7.3 million to pay certain operating
expenses and repay debt through the completion of the merger.
Please see Loan and Security Agreement. Goodwill may
increase up to $7.3 million from amounts shown below as
Computer Motion draws amounts under the bridge loan facility.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the
total estimated purchase price as shown in the table above is
allocated to Computer Motions net tangible and intangible
assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of
the completion of the merger. Based on the preliminary
valuation, and subject to material changes upon development of a
final valuation and other factors as described in the
introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements, the preliminary estimated
purchase price is allocated as follows (in thousands):

Total preliminary estimated purchase price

* 

Deferred compensation on unvested options is
    based on the portion of the intrinsic value (fair value less the
    exercise price) at March 20, 2003 related to the future
    vesting period as follows: intrinsic value of the aggregate
    shares multiplied by (remaining vesting period divided by total
    vesting period).

Of the total estimated purchase price, a
preliminary estimate of $13.6 million has been allocated to
net tangible assets assumed and $28.6 million has been
allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The
depreciation and amortization related to the fair value
adjustment to net tangible assets and the



amortization related to the amortizable
intangible assets are reflected as pro forma adjustments to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements
of operations.

Developed technology, which comprises products
that have reached technological feasibility, includes products
in Computer Motions Zeus, Aesop, Hermes, and Socrates
product lines. Core technology represents a combination of
Computer Motion patents, processes and trade secrets. Intuitive
Surgical expects to amortize the developed and core technology
on a straight-line basis over an average estimated life of seven
years.

The value assigned to developed and core
technology was determined by discounting the estimated future
cash flows of the existing products to their present value. The
revenue estimates used to value the developed and core
technology were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and
growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and
expected timing of new product introductions by Computer Motion
and its competitors.

The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows
of developed and core technology to their present value are
based on Computer Motions weighted average cost of
capital. The weighted average cost of capital reflects the
anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth
rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in
future target markets. Based on these factors, a discount rate
of 14% was deemed appropriate for valuing developed and core
technology.

Of the total estimated purchase price,
approximately $48.1 million has been allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an
acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net
tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not deductible for
tax purposes.

In accordance with the Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, goodwill resulting from business
combinations completed subsequent to June 30, 2001 will not
be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In
the event that the management of the combined company determines
that the goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will
incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during
the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.

Of the total estimated purchase price, a
preliminary estimate of $4.2 million has been allocated to
in-process research and development and will be charged to
expense in the period during which the merger is completed. Due
to its non-recurring nature, the in-process research and
development expense has been excluded in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined consolidated statement of operations.

Computer Motion is currently developing new
products that qualify as in-process research and development in
certain product areas. Projects which qualify as in-process
research and development represent those that have not yet
reached technological feasibility. Technological feasibility is
defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta-phase
working prototype in which there is no significant remaining
risk relating to the development.

Computer Motion is currently involved in research
and development projects, which are focused on developing new
products, integrating new technologies, improving product
performance and broadening features and functionalities. There
is a risk that these developments and enhancements will not be
competitive with other products using alternative technologies
that offer comparable functionality.

The value assigned to in-process research and
development was determined by considering the importance of each
project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to
develop the purchased in-process research and development into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net
cash flows to their present value. The revenue estimates used to
value the purchased in-process research and development were
based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors,
expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing
of new product introductions by Computer Motion and its
competitors.

The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows
to their present value are based on Computer Motions
weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of
capital was adjusted to reflect the



difficulties and uncertainties in completing each
project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the
percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market
acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks
related to the impact of potential changes in future target
markets. Based on these factors, discount rates that range from
20% to 22% were deemed appropriate for valuing the in-process
research and development.

The estimates used in valuing in-process research
and development were based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated
events and circumstances may occur. In addition, some projects
which are currently in process may not be in process at
completion of the merger and new projects may be started prior
to completion of the merger which may be in process at the
completion of the merger. Accordingly, actual results may vary
from the projected results.

Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect
the estimated purchase price, to adjust amounts related to
Computer Motions net tangible and intangible assets to a
preliminary estimate of their fair values, to reflect the
amortization expense related to the estimated amortizable
intangible assets, to reflect changes in depreciation and
amortization expense resulting from the estimated fair value
adjustments to net tangible assets, and to adjust certain
Computer Motion amounts to conform to Intuitive Surgicals
accounting policies.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
for liabilities relating to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection
with a Purchase Business Combination. Intuitive Surgical
is in the process of making these assessments and estimates of
these costs are not currently known. However, liabilities
ultimately will be recorded for severance or relocation costs
related to Computer Motion employees, costs of vacating some
facilities (leased or owned) of Computer Motion, or other costs
associated with exiting activities of Computer Motion that would
affect amounts in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements. The expected result of
recording liabilities relating to EITF No. 95-3 will be
primarily related to accrued liabilities with an offsetting
increase in goodwill.

Intuitive Surgical has not identified any
preacquisition contingencies where the related asset, liability
or impairment is probable and the amount of the asset, liability
or impairment can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the end of
the purchase price allocation period, if information becomes
available which would indicate it is probable that such events
have occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such
items will be included in the purchase price allocation.

The pro forma adjustments included in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial
statements are as follows:

(a) 

Adjustment to record the difference between the
    preliminary estimate of the fair value and the historical amount
    of Computer Motions inventory. An adjustment to the
    statement of operations has not been recorded, as it does not
    have a continuing impact on the business.

(b) 

Adjustment to reflect the preliminary estimate of
    the fair value of developed technology. The preliminary fair
    value is $24.9 million with an estimated useful life of
    7 years, resulting in increased amortization expense of
    $3.6 million.

(c) 

Adjustments to reflect the preliminary estimate
    of fair value of purchased intangible assets. Those assets
    consist primarily of customer relationships, trademarks and
    internal use software. The preliminary fair value is
    $3.7 million with estimated useful lives from 4 to
    7 years, resulting in increased amortization expense of
    $550,000 annually.

(d) 

Adjustment to reflect the preliminary estimate of
    the fair value of goodwill.

(e) 

Adjustment to reflect the preliminary estimate of
    the fair value of future service obligations and eliminate the
    historical amounts of Computer Motions deferred revenue.

(f) 

Adjustment to reflect the estimated direct
    transaction costs.



(g) 

Adjustment to conform Intuitive Surgical and
    Computer Motions accounting policies regarding the
    classification of development and grant revenue. The adjustment
    re-classifies non-refundable payments received under grant and
    product development arrangements from revenue to an offset of
    research and development costs.

(h) 

Adjustments to stockholders equity (in
    thousands):

(i) 

Adjustment to record the deferred compensation
    and amortization related to unvested options assumed. The
    preliminary estimate is based on the intrinsic value of the
    these options on March 20, 2003 for options outstanding on
    March 21, 2003. The deferred compensation related to
    unvested options is being amortized using the graded method over
    a three year period beginning January 1, 2002, which is the
    estimated vesting period of these options.

(j) 

Adjustment to eliminate the accrual and expense
    for the litigation settlement between Computer Motion and
    Intuitive Surgical, as collection of the underlying judgement
    will not be pursued.

(k) 

Adjustment to record stock compensation expense
    related to non-employee options assumed in the merger. The fair
    market value of the options was determined using the
    Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: No
    dividend yield; an expected volatility of 80%; a risk-free
    interest rate of 4.1%; and a contractual life of 9.7 years.
    The compensation expense is being amortized using the graded
    method over a three year service period beginning
    January 1, 2002.

(l) 

Adjustment to eliminate the dividends on
    preferred stock due to the assumed conversion of the preferred
    stock to common stock upon completion of the merger.

Note 3

Pro Forma Earnings Per Share

The pro forma basic and diluted net loss per
share are based on the weighted average number of shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock outstanding and weighted average
number of shares of Computer Motion common stock outstanding
multiplied by the exchange ratio. The weighted average number of
shares have been adjusted to reflect the issuance of
approximately 5.9 million shares of Intuitive
Surgicals common stock, for the assumed conversion of
Computer Motions preferred stock, as if the shares had
been outstanding for the entire period.



COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE MATTERS

Both Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion are
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Before the
completion of the merger, the rights of holders of Computer
Motion stock are governed by Delaware law, the Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Computer Motion and
the Bylaws of Computer Motion. After the completion of the
merger, former Computer Motion stockholders will become
stockholders of Intuitive Surgical, and their rights will be
governed by Delaware law, the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of Intuitive Surgical and the Bylaws of
Intuitive Surgical.

While there are substantial similarities between
the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Intuitive
Surgical and Computer Motion, a number of differences do exist.
The following is a summary of the material differences between
the rights of Intuitive Surgical stockholders and the rights of
Computer Motion stockholders. While we believe that this summary
covers the material differences between the two, this summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
This summary is not intended to be a complete discussion of the
respective rights of Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion
stockholders and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Delaware law and the various documents of Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion that we refer to in this summary. You should
carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the other documents we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a more complete understanding of the
differences between being a stockholder of Intuitive Surgical
and being a stockholder of Computer Motion. Intuitive Surgical
and Computer Motion have filed with the SEC their respective
documents referred to herein and will send copies of these
documents to you upon your request. Please see Where You
Can Find More Information.

Intuitive Surgical

Computer Motion

Authorized Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of Intuitive
    Surgical consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par
    value of $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
    stock, par value of $0.001 per share.

The authorized capital stock of Computer Motion
    consists of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of
    $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
    value $0.001 per share, including 12,000 shares of Series A
    junior participating preferred stock, 12,000 shares of
    Series B convertible preferred stock, 10,750 shares of
    Series C convertible preferred stock, and 10,750 shares of
    Series D convertible preferred stock.

Number of Directors

Delaware law provides that a corporation must
    have at least one director and that the number of directors
    shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in the bylaws unless
    the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors.
    Intuitive Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation provides that the number of directors shall be
    fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of directors.
    The number of directors of Intuitive Surgical is currently fixed
    at seven.

Computer Motions Second Amended and
    Restated Certificate of Incorporation does not fix the number of
    directors and its bylaws provide that its board of directors
    will consist of seven directors, unless such number is increased
    by the stockholders or the board of directors then in office.
    The number of directors of Computer Motion is currently fixed at
    seven.



Intuitive Surgical

Computer Motion

Cumulative Voting

Delaware law allows for a corporations
    certificate of incorporation to permit stockholders to cumulate
    their votes for directors. The Amended and Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation of Intuitive Surgical provides that holders of
    Intuitive Surgical common stock have cumulative voting rights
    only if, among other things, the corporation ceases to be a
    listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

The Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation of Computer Motion does not provide for cumulative
    voting for directors.

Classification of Board of Directors

Delaware law permits, but does not require, a
    classified board of directors, divided into as many as three
    classes with staggered terms under which one-half or one-third
    of the directors are elected to terms of two or three years, as
    applicable. Intuitive Surgicals Amended and Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation provides for three classes of
    directors that serve staggered terms of three years.

Computer Motions Second Amended and
    Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws do not provide
    for the classification of the board of directors.

Removal of Directors

Under Delaware law, directors may be removed from
    office by a majority stockholder vote and in the case of the
    corporation whose board is classified, stockholders may effect
    such removal only for cause. Intuitive Surgicals Amended
    and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that
    directors may be removed as provided by Delaware law. Because
    Intuitive Surgical has a classified board of directors,
    stockholders may effect removal of the directors for cause.

Computer Motions Bylaws provide that
    Computer Motions directors may be removed from office by a
    majority stockholder vote.

Amendment of Certificate of
    Incorporation

Under Delaware law and Intuitive Surgicals
    Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation the
    certificate of incorporation may be amended by the affirmative
    vote of the holders of a majority of the voting rights of all
    classes of stock entitled to vote. However, the affirmative vote
    of the holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the
    outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled
    to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together
    as a single class, is required to amend the provisions relating
    to:

     the authority, number and classification

Under Delaware law, Computer Motions Second
    Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended
    by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
    voting rights of all classes of stock entitled to vote.

Amendment of Bylaws

Delaware law provides that a corporations
    stockholders entitled to vote have the power to amend bylaws,
    although the corporations certificate of incorporation may
    give the board of directors the power to amend the bylaws.
    Intuitive Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation provides that the bylaws may be amended by
    Intuitive Surgicals board of directors or by an
    affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the voting
    power of all stock entitled to vote.

Computer Motions Second Amended and
    Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the bylaws
    may be amended, altered or repealed by the board of directors.

Special Meeting of Stockholders

Under Delaware law, meetings may be held in the
    manner provided by the bylaws of the corporation. Intuitive
    Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation and Bylaws provide that special meetings of the
    stockholders may be called by the chairman of the board, the
    chief executive officer, or a majority of the board of directors.

Delivery and Notice Requirements of
    Stockholder Nominations and Proposals

Intuitive Surgicals Bylaws provide that for
    a stockholder proposal to be brought properly before an annual
    meeting, the proposal must be a proper matter for stockholder
    action under Delaware law and the stockholder must notify the
    corporate secretary of Intuitive Surgical not less than
    90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first
    anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting.
    However, if the actual date of the annual meeting is more than
    30 days before or more than 30 days after that
    anniversary date, then notice must be delivered no earlier than
    the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and no later than the
    90th day prior to the annual meeting, or no later than the 10th
    day after the day on which public announcement of the date of
    the annual meeting is first made by Intuitive Surgical.

    Intuitive Surgicals Bylaws also provide that in the event
    Intuitive Surgical calls a special meeting of stockholders for
    the purpose of electing directors, a stockholder may nominate a
    person for election if they deliver notice to the secretary of
    Intuitive Surgical no earlier than the 120th day prior to the

    stockholder proposal to be brought properly before any
    stockholder meeting, the stockholder must notify the corporate

    10th day after the day on which public disclosure of the meeting
    is first made by Computer Motion.

Limitation of Personal Liability
    of Directors and Officers

In accordance with Delaware law, Intuitive
    Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation provides for the indemnification of its directors
    from personal liability to the fullest extent not prohibited by
    Delaware law. Delaware law permits a corporation to eliminate a
    directors personal liability for monetary damages
    resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty, except in
    circumstances involving wrongful acts, including the
    following:

     any breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation
    or its stockholders;

     acts or omissions not in good faith or

In accordance with Delaware law, Computer
    Motions Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
    Incorporation provides that none of its directors shall be
    personally liable to it or any of its stockholders for monetary
    damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. However,
    this provision excludes any limitation on liability for:

     any breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation
    or stockholders;

     acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
    intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
    violation of law;

     for any acts under Section 174 of the Delaware
    General Corporation Law; or

     any transaction from which the director derives an
    improper personal benefit.

 unlawful distributions under Delaware
    law; or

     any transaction from which the director derives an
    improper personal benefit.

Stockholder Rights Plan

Intuitive Surgical does not have a stockholder
    rights plan.

On June 14, 1999, Computer Motion adopted a
    stockholder rights plan pursuant to a rights agreement. The
    following description of the rights agreement is subject in its
    entirety to the terms and conditions of the rights agreement.
    You should read the rights agreement carefully. See Where
    You Can Find More Information below.

Exercisability of Rights. 
Pursuant to Computer
    Motions rights agreement, one whole right attaches to each
    share of Computer Motion common stock outstanding on
    June 28, 1999. Each right entitles the registered holder to
    purchase from Computer Motion one one- hundredth (1/100) of a
    share of Computer Motion Series A Junior Participating Preferred
    Stock at an initial purchase price of $70.00, subject
    adjustment.

    The rights do not become exercisable until the earlier to occur
    of:

     10 business days following a public announcement
    that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20%
    or more of Computer Motions outstanding common stock,
    or

     10 business days following the commencement or
    announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange
    offer, that would result in a person or entity becoming the
    beneficial owner of 20% or more of such outstanding common
    stock.

Flip-In Feature. 
If a person or group
    becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or



Intuitive Surgical

Computer Motion

more of the outstanding shares of Computer Motion
    common stock, then each registered holder of a Computer Motion
    right, except for such person or group, will be entitled to
    purchase, upon exercise, shares of Computer Motion common stock
    having a then current market value equal to two times the
    exercise price of the right.

Flip-Over Feature. 
Each right will entitle
    the holder, except for a person or group that is the beneficial
    owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Computer
    Motion common stock, to purchase, upon exercise, a number of
    shares of common stock of an acquiring company having a then
    current market value of two times the exercise price of the
    right if an acquiring company obtains 20% or more of the
    outstanding shares of Computer Motion common stock and then one
    of the following occurs:

     Computer Motion is involved in a merger, or

     Computer Motion sells more than 50% of its assets or
    earning power to an acquiring company.

    Computer Motion may, at its option, at any time prior to the
    close of business on the tenth day following the day a person or
    group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of
    Computer Motion, redeem all of the then- outstanding rights at a
    redemption price of $.01 per right, subject to certain
    adjustments.

    At any time after a person or group acquires 20% or more of the
    outstanding common stock of Computer Motion and prior to the
    acquisition by that person or group of 50% or more of the
    outstanding common stock, Computer Motions board of
    directors may cause it to acquire the rights (other than rights
    owned by the person or group that acquired 20%, which
    terminated) of the outstanding shares of



Intuitive Surgical

Computer Motion

common stock of Computer Motion, in whole or in
    part, in exchange for common stock having a value equal to the
    exercise price.

    Until a right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will
    have no rights as a stockholder of the Computer Motion and will
    not have the right to vote or to receive dividends by virtue of
    the right.

    Any of the provisions of the rights agreement may be amended by
    the board of directors of Computer Motion prior to the exercise
    date. After the exercise date, the provisions of the rights
    agreement may be amended by the board of directors in order to
    cure any ambiguity, to make changes which do not adversely
    affect the interests of holders of rights, or to shorten or
    lengthen any time period under the rights agreement; provided,
    however, that no amendment to adjust the time period governing
    redemption shall be made at such time as the rights are not
    redeemable.

Anti-takeover Effects. 
Computer Motions rights
    agreement is designed to maximize the value of Computer
    Motions outstanding common stock in the event of an
    unsolicited attempt to take over Computer Motion in a manner or
    on terms that are not approved by the Computer Motion board of
    directors. Once the Computer Motion rights have become
    exercisable, the rights will cause substantial dilution to a
    person or group that attempts to acquire or merge with Computer
    Motion in most cases. The rights could discourage, delay or
    prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or
    potential change in control of Computer Motion, including
    transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a
    premium for their shares over current market prices. The rights
    should not interfere with any merger or other business
    combination approved by the Computer Motion board of directors
    since Computer Motion may redeem the



Intuitive Surgical

Computer Motion

rights prior to the time that a person becomes
    the beneficial owner of 20% or more of outstanding shares of
    Computer Motion common stock.

    The Computer Motion rights agreement does not apply to the
    merger with Computer Motion.



APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under applicable Delaware, neither the
stockholders of Intuitive Surgical nor the stockholders of
Computer Motion will have dissenters rights of appraisal
in connection with the merger.



AMENDMENT OF INTUITIVE
SURGICALS

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors has
unanimously recommended that an amendment to Intuitive
Surgicals Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation effecting a reverse stock split of Intuitive
Surgicals common stock be presented to stockholders for
approval at the annual meeting. The amendment is attached as
Annex F to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. If
approved, this amendment would result in the automatic
conversion of each share of Intuitive Surgical common stock
outstanding as of the time of filing of the amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware into one-half of one
share of Intuitive Surgical common stock.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
believes that the reverse stock split will be beneficial to
Intuitive Surgical and its stockholders. The reverse stock split
is intended to increase the marketability and liquidity of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock. Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors believes that the current
market price of Intuitive Surgicals common stock has a
tendency to diminish the effective marketability of the common
stock because of the reluctance of many brokerage firms to
recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients. Additionally,
the policies and practices of a number of brokerage houses tend
to discourage individual brokers within those firms from dealing
in lower-priced stocks. Some of these policies and practices
relate to the payment of brokers commission and to
time-consuming procedures that operate to make the handling of
lower-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers. The
structure of trading commissions also tends to have an adverse
impact upon holders of lower-priced stocks because the brokerage
commission payable on the sale of a lower-priced stock generally
represents a higher percentage of the sales price than the
commission on a relatively higher-priced stock.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors also
believes that the relatively low price of Intuitive
Surgicals common stock, when compared with the market
prices of the common stock of other medical device companies,
impairs the marketability of Intuitive Surgicals common
stock to institutional investors and members of the investing
public and creates a negative impression with respect to
Intuitive Surgical. Theoretically, the number of shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock outstanding should not, by
itself, affect the marketability of Intuitive Surgicals
common stock, the type of investor who acquires it or Intuitive
Surgicals reputation in the medical device industry. In
practice this may not necessarily be the case, as many investors
view low-priced stock as unduly speculative in nature and, as a
matter of practice, avoid or limit investments in such stocks.
The foregoing factors adversely affect not only the liquidity of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock, but also Intuitive
Surgicals ability to raise additional capital through a
sale of equity securities.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors is
hopeful, although no assurance can be given, that the decrease
in the number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock
outstanding as a consequence of the proposed reverse stock
split, and the anticipated corresponding increased price per
share, will stimulate interest in Intuitive Surgicals
common stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for
Intuitive Surgicals stockholders with respect to those
shares presently held by them. However, the possibility does
exist that such liquidity may be adversely affected by the
reduced number of shares which would be outstanding if the
proposed reverse stock split is effected.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors is
also hopeful that the proposed reverse stock split will result
in a price level for the shares that will mitigate the present
reluctance, policies and practices on the part of brokerage
firms referred to above and diminish the adverse impact of
trading commissions on the potential market for shares of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock. However, there can be no
assurance that the proposed reverse stock split will achieve the
desired results outlined above, nor can there be any assurance
that the price per share of Intuitive Surgicals common
stock immediately after the proposed reverse stock split will
increase proportionately with the reverse split or that any
increase can be sustained for a long period of time.

If Intuitive Surgicals stockholders approve
the amendment at the annual meeting, the reverse stock split
will be effected, if at all, only upon a determination by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors that the reverse
stock split is in the best interests of Intuitive Surgical and
its stockholders at that time. Such



determination will be based upon a number of
factors, including but not limited to the then-current price of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock, the availability of
additional working capital, existing and expected marketability
and liquidity of Intuitive Surgicals common stock,
prevailing market conditions and the likely effect on the market
price of Intuitive Surgicals common stock. Notwithstanding
approval of the amendment by the stockholders at the annual
meeting, Intuitive Surgicals board of directors may, in
its sole discretion, determine not to effect the reverse stock
split prior to Intuitive Surgicals 2004 annual meeting of
stockholders. If Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
fails to implement the reverse stock split prior to such
meeting, stockholder approval again would be required prior to
implementing any reverse stock split.

Intuitive Surgical is not aware of any present
efforts by any persons to accumulate Intuitive Surgicals
common stock or to obtain control of Intuitive Surgical and the
proposed reverse stock split is not intended to be an
anti-takeover device. The amendment is being sought simply to
enhance the image of Intuitive Surgical, its corporate
flexibility and to price the stock in a price range generally
more acceptable to the brokerage community and to investors.

Effects of the Reverse Stock Split

Based on the capitalization of Intuitive Surgical
as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we
estimate that approximately 25.9 million shares of
Intuitive Surgicals common stock will be outstanding as a
result of the reverse stock split and assuming that the merger
is completed.

All outstanding options, warrants, rights and
convertible securities will be appropriately adjusted, as
required by their terms, for the reverse stock split
automatically on the effective date of the reverse stock split.
The reverse stock split will affect all stockholders equally and
will not affect any stockholders proportionate equity
interest in Intuitive Surgical except to the extent of cash in
lieu of fractional shares. None of the rights currently accruing
to holders of Intuitive Surgicals common stock, options or
warrants to purchase common stock, or securities convertible
into common stock will be affected by the reverse stock split.
Following the reverse stock split, each share of new common
stock will entitle the holder thereof to one vote per share and
will otherwise be identical to the existing common stock. The
reverse stock split also will have no effect on the number of
authorized shares of common stock or the par value of the common
stock.

Execution and Consequences of the Reverse
Stock Split

Each stock certificate representing old common
stock will, after the effective date of the reverse stock split,
represent the appropriate number of shares of new common stock
reflecting the reverse stock split. It will not be necessary for
stockholders to exchange their existing stock certificates.
Stockholders may, however, exchange their certificates if they
so choose.

No scrip or fractional certificates will be
issued in the reverse stock split. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, and solely for the purpose of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares, any
stockholder who would otherwise receive a fractional share upon
the reverse stock split will be entitled to receive cash in lieu
of such fractional share. For the purpose of determining
ownership of Intuitive Surgicals common stock at the
effective date of the reverse stock split, shares will be
considered to be held by the person in whose name those shares
are registered on Intuitive Surgicals stock records,
regardless of the beneficial ownership of those shares.

The reverse stock split may leave certain
stockholders with odd lots of common stock (i.e.,
stock in amounts of less than one hundred shares). These shares
may be more difficult to sell, or require a greater commission
per share to sell, than shares in even multiples of one hundred.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Reverse Stock Split

The following is a summary of the material
anticipated federal income tax consequences of the reverse stock
split to stockholders of Intuitive Surgical. This summary is
based on the provisions of the



Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Treasury
Department Regulations issued pursuant thereto, and published
rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all
of which are subject to change. This summary does not take into
account possible changes in such laws or interpretations,
including amendments to the Code, applicable statutes,
Regulations and proposed Regulations or changes in judicial or
administrative rulings, which may have retroactive effect. No
assurance can be given that any such changes will not adversely
affect the discussion of this summary.

This summary is provided for general information
only and does not purport to address all aspects of the possible
federal income tax consequences of the reverse stock split and
is not intended as tax advice to any person or entity. In
particular, and without limiting the foregoing, this summary
does not consider the federal income tax consequences to
stockholders of Intuitive Surgical in light of their individual
investment circumstances or to stockholders subject to special
treatment under the federal income tax laws (for example, tax
exempt entities, life insurance companies, regulated investment
companies and foreign taxpayers). In addition, this summary does
not address any consequences of the reverse stock split under
any state, local or foreign tax laws. As a result, it is the
responsibility of each stockholder to obtain and rely on advice
from his, her or its personal tax advisor as to (1) the
effect on his, her or its personal tax situation of the reverse
stock split, including the application and effect of state,
local and foreign income and other tax laws, (2) the effect
of possible future legislation and Regulations and (3) the
reporting of information required in connection with the reverse
stock split on his, her or its own tax returns. It will be the
responsibility of each stockholder to prepare and file all
appropriate federal, state and local tax returns.

No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or
opinion of counsel will be obtained regarding the federal income
tax consequences to the stockholders of Intuitive Surgical as a
result of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, each stockholder
is encouraged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding
the specific tax consequences of the proposed transaction to
such stockholder, including the application and effect of state,
local and foreign income and other tax laws.

Intuitive Surgical believes that the reverse
stock split will qualify as a recapitalization under
Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code. As a result, no gain or
loss will be recognized by Intuitive Surgical or its
stockholders in connection with the reverse stock split. A
stockholder of Intuitive Surgical who exchanges his, her or its
old common stock solely for new common stock will recognize no
gain or loss for federal income tax purposes except to the
extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. A
stockholders aggregate tax basis in his, her or its shares
of new common stock will be the same as his, her or its
aggregate tax basis in the old common stock. The holding period
of the new common stock will include the period during which the
old common stock was held, 
provided 
all such common stock
was held as a capital asset on the date of the exchange.

Director Compensation

Directors currently receive no cash compensation
from us for their services as members of the board or for
attendance at committee meetings. Directors may be reimbursed
for expenses in connection with attendance at board of directors
and committee meetings.

In March 2000, Intuitive Surgical adopted the
2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan to provide
for the automatic grant of options to purchase shares of common
stock to our non-employee directors who are not employees of
Intuitive Surgical or any affiliate of Intuitive Surgical. All
non-employee directors elected after the completion of Intuitive
Surgicals initial public offering receive an initial
option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock. In connection
with our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2002, all
non-employee directors received an option to purchase 5,000
shares of common stock. In connection with the annual meeting,
all non-employee directors will receive an option to purchase
5,000 shares of common stock. If our stockholders approve the
proposed amendment to the 2000 Non-Employee Directors
Stock Option Plan at the annual meeting, each non-employee
director will receive an option to purchase an additional 5,000
shares and committee chairs will receive an option to purchase
an additional 5,000 shares of common stock. All grant amounts
under the 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
will be reduced proportionately in the event that the proposed
reverse stock split is approved by Intuitive Surgicals
stockholders and implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors. Please see Amendment to Intuitive
Surgicals 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option
Plan.

Committees of the Board of Directors

In 2002, Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors held four meetings. Intuitive Surgicals board of
directors has two standing committees, the audit committee and
the compensation committee.

Intuitive Surgicals audit committee has
responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations
regarding employment of independent accountants, the annual
audit of our financial statements, internal controls and
accounting practices and policies. The members of Intuitive
Surgicals audit committee are Scott Halsted, Richard
Kramer and James Lawrence. In 2002, Intuitive Surgicals
audit committee met seven times and each member of the audit
committee attended 100% with the exception of Mr. Halsted
who attended 71% of those meetings.

Intuitive Surgicals compensation committee
has responsibility for determining the nature and amount of
compensation for management and for administering our employee
benefit plans. The members of Intuitive Surgicals
compensation committee are Alan Levy and Russell Hirsch. In
2002, Intuitive Surgicals compensation committee met two
times and each member of the compensation committee attended
100% of those meetings.

Compliance With Section 16(a) Under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 requires that executive officers and directors, and
persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of
equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in
ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC. Executive officers,
directors and greater-than-10% holders are required to furnish
copies of all of these forms which they file.

Recommendation of Intuitive Surgicals
Board of Directors

INTUITIVE SURGICALS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT INTUITIVE SURGICAL STOCKHOLDERS VOTE

FOR 
EACH OF THE NOMINEES TO INTUITIVE
SURGICALS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.



AMENDMENT TO INTUITIVE
SURGICALS

2000 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK
PLAN

Intuitive Surgical stockholders are being asked
to approve an amendment to the Intuitive Surgicals 2000
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, or
Directors Plan. Under the current terms of the
Directors Plan, each non-employee director receives an
initial option to purchase 20,000 shares of Intuitive Surgical
common stock upon his or her election to Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors as a non-employee director.
Subsequently, each non-employee director with at least six
months of service receives an annual grant of options to
purchase 5,000 shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock on the
day after each annual stockholders meeting. The
stockholders of Intuitive Surgical are now being asked to amend
the Directors Plan to increase the annual stock option
grant for non-employee directors from 5,000 to 10,000 shares and
to provide an additional annual grant of options to purchase
5,000 shares for committee chairs, effective on the day after
the 2003 annual stockholders meeting.

Under the current terms of the Directors
Plan, the automatic share increase provision provides for an
annual increase on the day after each annual stockholders
meeting equal to the greater of (1) three-tenths of one
percent of Intuitive Surgicals outstanding common stock on
such date (calculated on a fully-diluted basis) or (2) the
number of shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock subject to
options granted during the prior 12-month period. Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors may, however, provide for a
lesser increase in its discretion. The stockholders of Intuitive
Surgical are also being asked to amend the Directors Plan
to revise the automatic share increase provisions so that the
number of shares of common stock reserved under the
Directors Plan will be automatically increased by the
lesser of (1) three-tenths of one percent of Intuitive
Surgicals outstanding common stock on such date
(calculated on a fully-diluted basis), (2) 200,000 shares
or (3) such lesser amount as Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors may determine from time to time.

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors
approved the proposed amendment on March 25, 2003,
effective upon stockholder approval. This amendment is intended
to enable Intuitive Surgical to continue to provide its
non-employee directors with stock incentives and to ensure that
Intuitive Surgical can continue to provide such incentives at
levels determined appropriate by Intuitive Surgicals board
of directors.

Directors Plan History

In September 1998, Intuitive Surgicals
board of directors adopted, and the stockholders subsequently
approved, the Directors Plan. Originally, 300,000 shares
of common stock were reserved for issuance under the
Directors Plan. This amount currently increases
automatically each year on the day after each annual
stockholders meeting as described above.

As of the record date, options (net of cancelled,
repurchased or expired options) covering an aggregate of 90,000
shares had been granted under the Directors Plan and
426,612 shares (plus any shares that might in the future be
returned to the Directors Plan as a result of
cancellations, repurchases or expiration of options) remained
available for future grant under the Directors Plan,
including the 109,125 shares added to reserve on May 24,
2002 pursuant to the existing automatic share increase
provisions of the Directors Plan.

Below is a summary of the principal provisions of
the Directors Plan assuming approval of this proposal,
which summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the Directors Plan. The full text of the
proposed amendment to the Directors Plan is attached as

Annex G
 to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.
Intuitive Surgical will provide, without charge, to each person
to whom this joint proxy statement/prospectus is delivered, upon
request of such person and by first class mail within one
business day of receipt of such request, a copy of the
Directors Plan. Any such request should be directed as
follows: Investor Relations, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.,
950 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086; telephone
number (408) 523-2100.



General

The purpose of the Directors Plan is to
provide a means by which non-employee directors may be given an
opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the common
stock through the granting of nonstatutory stock options.
Intuitive Surgical, by means of the Directors Plan, seeks
to retain the services of its non-employee directors, to secure
and retain the services of new non-employee directors and to
provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts to
promote the success of Intuitive Surgical and its affiliates.
Nonstatutory stock options granted under the Directors
Plan are not intended to qualify as incentive stock options, as
defined under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. See
Federal Income Tax Information for a discussion of
the tax treatment of nonstatutory stock options.

Administration

The Directors Plan is administered by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors. Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors has the final power to
construe and interpret the Directors Plan and options
granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and
regulations for its administration.

Shares Subject to the Directors
Plan

As of the record date, 426,612 shares of
Intuitive Surgical common stock are reserved for issuance under
the Directors Plan, including the 109,125 shares
added to the reserve in 2002 pursuant to the existing automatic
share increase provisions of the Directors Plan. If this
proposal is approved by Intuitive Surgicals stockholders,
the automatic share increase provision will be revised so that
the share reserve will increase automatically each year for
10 years on the day after each annual stockholders
meeting, commencing in 2003 and continuing through 2013, by a
number of shares equal to the lesser of (1) three-tenths of
one percent of the Intuitive Surgical outstanding common stock
on such date (calculated on a fully-diluted basis),
(2) 200,000 shares or (3) such lesser number as
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors may determine from
time to time.

If any option expires or terminates, in whole or
in part, without having been exercised in full, the common stock
not purchased under such option reverts to and again becomes
available for issuance under the Directors Plan. The
common stock subject to the Directors Plan may be unissued
shares or reacquired shares, bought on the market or otherwise.

Eligibility

The Directors Plan provides that
nonstatutory options may be granted only to non-employee
directors of Intuitive Surgical. A non-employee
director is defined in the Directors Plan as a
director of Intuitive Surgical who is not otherwise an employee
of Intuitive Surgical or any affiliate. As of the record date,
five of Intuitive Surgicals directors are eligible to
participate in the Directors Plan.

Option grants under the Directors Plan are
non-discretionary. Pursuant to the terms of the Directors
Plan, (1) each non-employee director automatically shall be
granted, upon his or her initial election or appointment as a
non-employee director, an option to purchase 20,000 shares of
common stock, which is referred to as the initial grant; and
(2) each person who is serving as a Non-Employee Director
on the day following each annual meeting of stockholders
automatically shall be granted an option to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock, which is referred to as an annual grant,
assuming approval of this proposal.

In addition, on the day following each annual
meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director who is
serving as a chairman of any committee duly established by
Intuitive Surgicals board of directors shall be granted an
additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock,
which is referred to as a committee chairman grant, assuming
approval of this proposal.

All grant amounts under the 2000 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan will be reduced
proportionately in the event that the proposed reverse stock
split is approved by Intuitive Surgicals stockholders and
implemented by Intuitive Surgicals board of directors.



Terms of Options

Term and Termination

No option granted under the Directors Plan
is exercisable by any person after the expiration of
10 years from the date the option is granted. An
optionholder whose service relationship with Intuitive Surgical
or any affiliate (whether as a Non-Employee Director of
Intuitive Surgical or subsequently as an employee, director or
consultant of either Intuitive Surgical or an affiliate) ceases
for any reason may exercise vested options for the term provided
in the option agreement (three months generally, 12 months
in the event of disability and 18 months in the event of
death).

Exercise Price

The exercise price of options granted under the
Directors Plan shall be equal to 100% of the fair market
value of Intuitive Surgicals common stock. The fair market
value of the common stock is defined in the Directors Plan
as the closing sales price for such stock on the Nasdaq National
Market on the last market trading day prior to the day of
determination. If the common stock is not publicly-traded on
such date, the fair market value will be determined by Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors.

Consideration

The exercise price of options granted under the
Directors Plan may be paid, to the extent provided in the
option agreement between Intuitive Surgical and the
optionholder, in any combination of the following: (1) by
cash or check; or (2) by delivery of other common stock of
Intuitive Surgical held by the non-employee director for at
least 6 months, or such longer or shorter period of time
required to avoid a charge to earnings for financial accounting
purposes; or (3) pursuant to a program developed under
Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board
that, prior to the issuance of the common stock, results in
either the receipt of cash by Intuitive Surgical or the receipt
of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price
to Intuitive Surgical from the sale proceeds.

Transferability

Under the Directors Plan, an option may not
be transferred by the optionholder, except by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution or to a family member. During
the lifetime of an optionholder, an option may be exercised only
by the optionholder or a permitted transferee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the optionholder may, by delivering written
notice to Intuitive Surgical, in a form satisfactory to
Intuitive Surgical, designate a third party who, in the event of
the death of the optionholder, shall thereafter be entitled to
exercise the option.

Vesting

Initial Grants to new non-employee directors
under the Directors Plan shall vest in equal monthly
installments over the 36 months following the date of grant
for a total vesting period of three years. Annual Grants to
continuing non-employee directors and to committee chairmen
shall vest in equal monthly installments over a period of one
year from the date of grant. Such vesting is conditioned upon
continued service as a director, employee or consultant of
Intuitive Surgical.

Other Provisions

The option agreement may contain such other
terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the
Directors Plan as may be determined by Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors.

Adjustments Upon Changes in Common
Stock

If any change is made in the common stock subject
to the Directors Plan or subject to any option granted
under the Directors Plan, without receipt of consideration
by Intuitive Surgical (through merger, consolidation,
reorganization recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in
property other than cash, stock



split, liquidating, dividend, combination of
shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or
otherwise) and including the proposed reverse stock split, the
number of shares reserved for issuance under the Directors
Plan and options outstanding thereunder and the class, number of
shares and price per share of stock subject to such outstanding
options will be appropriately adjusted.

The Directors Plan provides that, in the
event of (1) a consolidation or merger in which Intuitive
Surgical is not the surviving corporation; (2) a reverse
merger in which Intuitive Surgical is the surviving corporation
but the shares of common stock outstanding immediately preceding
the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other
property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise;
or (3) any sale, lease or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of Intuitive Surgical, the
occurrence of any of which is referred to as a change in
control, then any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation
shall assume any options outstanding under the Directors
Plan or substitute similar options for any options outstanding.
If any surviving or acquiring corporation refuses to assume such
options or substitute similar options, then the vesting of such
options outstanding under the Directors Plan shall be
accelerated in full and the options terminated if not exercised
at or prior to such event.

If the surviving or acquiring corporation assumes
the outstanding options under the Directors Plan but a
non-employee director is not elected or appointed to the board
of directors of the surviving or acquiring corporation at the
first meeting of such board of directors after the change in
control, then the vesting of the options outstanding under the
Directors Plan held by such non-employee director shall be
accelerated by 18 months on the day after the first meeting
of the board of directors of the surviving or acquiring
corporation.

Amendment, Termination or Suspension of the
Directors Plan

Intuitive Surgicals board of directors may
amend, suspend or terminate the Directors Plan at any time
or from time to time. No amendment shall be effective unless
approved by the stockholders of Intuitive Surgical within
12 months before or after the adoption of the amendment,
where such amendment requires stockholder approval in order for
the Directors Plan to satisfy the requirements of
Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any
Nasdaq or securities exchange listing requirement. The plan
administrator may in its sole discretion submit any other
amendment to the Directors Plan for stockholder approval.

No options may be granted under the
Directors Plan while the Directors Plan is suspended
or after it is terminated.

Federal Income Tax Information

The following is a general summary under current
law of the material federal income tax consequences to Intuitive
Surgical and participants in the Directors Plan with
respect to the grant and exercise of options under the
Directors Plan. This summary deals with the general tax
principles that apply and is provided only for general
information. Some kinds of taxes, such as state and local income
taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to
change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and
from locality to locality. The summary does not discuss all
aspects of income taxation that may be relevant to an optionee
in light of his or her personal investment circumstances. This
summarized tax information is not tax advice.

Intuitive Surgical advises all optionees to
consult their own tax advisor as to the specific tax
consequences of participating in the Directors
Plan.

Options granted under the Directors Plan
are nonstatutory options. Nonstatutory stock options granted
under the Directors Plan generally have the following
federal income tax consequences:

There are no tax consequences to the optionholder
or Intuitive Surgical by reason of the grant of a nonstatutory
stock option. Upon exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, the
optionholder normally will recognize taxable ordinary income
equal to the excess of the stocks fair market value on the
date of exercise over the option exercise price. Generally,
Intuitive Surgical will be entitled (subject to the



requirement of reasonableness) to a business
expense deduction equal to the taxable ordinary income realized
by the optionholder. Upon disposition of the stock, the
optionholder will recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the
difference between the selling price and the sum of the amount
paid for such stock plus any amount recognized as ordinary
income upon exercise of such option. Such gain or loss will be
long or short-term depending on whether the stock was held for
more than one year.

the annual meeting by holders of Intuitive Surgicals

Voting, Proxies; Revocation

A proxy card is enclosed for your use. We ask
that you sign, date and return the proxy card in the
accompanying envelope, which is postage prepaid if you mail it
in the United States. Unless there are different instructions on
the proxy, all shares represented by valid proxies (and not
revoked before they are voted) will be voted at the annual
meeting 
FOR 
each of the proposals other than
the election of directors and 
FOR 
each of the
nominees for election to the board of directors listed in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. With respect to any other
business that may properly come before the annual meeting and be
submitted to a vote of stockholders, proxies will be voted in
accordance with the best judgment of the designated proxy
holders.

Stockholders of record may vote by either
completing and returning the enclosed proxy card prior to the
annual meeting, voting in person at the annual meeting, or
submitting a signed proxy card at the annual meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please
sign and return the accompanying proxy card whether or not you
plan to attend the annual meeting in person.

You may revoke your proxy at any time before it
is actually voted at the meeting by:

 

delivering written notice of revocation to
    Intuitive Surgicals Secretary at 950 Kifer Road,
    Sunnyvale, California 94086;

 

submitting a later dated proxy; or

 

attending the annual meeting and voting in person.

Your attendance at the annual meeting will not,
by itself, constitute revocation of your proxy. You may also be
represented by another person present at the annual meeting by
executing a form of proxy designating that person to act on your
behalf. Shares may only be voted by or on behalf of the record
holder of shares as indicated in Intuitive Surgicals stock
transfer records. If you are a beneficial owner but your shares
are held of record by another person, such as a stock brokerage
firm or bank, that person must vote the shares as the record
holder in accordance with the beneficial holders
instructions.

All votes cast at the annual meeting will be
tabulated by the persons appointed by us to act as inspectors of
election for the annual meeting.



Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Shares represented by proxies that reflect
abstentions or broker non-votes (
i.e.
, shares
held by a broker or nominee which are represented at the
meeting, but with respect to which the broker or nominee is not
empowered to vote on a particular proposal) will be counted as
shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum but will not be counted as
votes 
FOR 
or 
AGAINST 
a
particular proposal in determining whether a matter has been
approved. Broker non-votes are not deemed to be entitled to vote
for purposes of determining whether stockholder approval of a
matter has been obtained. As a result, broker non-votes are not
included in the tabulation of voting results on the election of
directors or issues requiring approval of a majority of the
shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock entitled to vote or a
majority of total votes cast and, therefore, do not have the
effect of votes in opposition in such tabulations. Abstentions
and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the
proposal to amend Intuitive Surgicals Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-2 reverse stock
split. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on
the proposal to issue Intuitive Surgical common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement or on any of the other proposals.

Proxy Solicitation

This solicitation is made on behalf of Intuitive
Surgicals board of directors and Intuitive Surgical will
pay the costs of solicitation, except that Intuitive Surgical

costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and related proxy materials. Intuitive
Surgicals directors, officers and employees may also
solicit proxies by telephone, telegraph, fax or personal
interview. Intuitive Surgical will not pay any additional
compensation to directors, officers or other employees for such

incurred by them in sending proxy material to its stockholders.

were                      shares
of Computer Motion common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
at the special meeting and 8,797 shares of Computer Motion
preferred stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting. Each share of Computer Motion common stock is entitled
to one vote. Each share of Computer Motion Series D
convertible preferred stock is entitled to 1,000 votes. As of
the record date, our executive officers and directors owned an
aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares of Computer
Motion common stock and 1,191 shares of Computer Motion
Series D convertible preferred stock, collectively
representing approximately 14% of the voting power of the
outstanding Computer Motion common and preferred stock as of
that date. A list of Computer Motion stockholders will be
available for review at Computer Motions executive offices
during regular business hours for a period of 10 days prior
to the special meeting.

Quorum and Vote Required

A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a
valid special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of a
majority of the votes of outstanding shares of Computer Motion
common stock and preferred stock entitled to vote is necessary
to constitute a quorum at the Computer Motion special meeting.
Abstentions and broker non-votes, discussed below,
count as present for establishing a quorum.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the votes of the outstanding shares of Computer Motion common
stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class, is
required to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

A proxy card is enclosed for your use. We ask
that you sign, date and return the proxy card in the
accompanying envelope, which is postage prepaid if you mail it
in the United States. Unless there are different instructions on
the proxy, all shares represented by valid proxies (and not
revoked before they are voted) will be voted at the special
meeting 
FOR 
the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement. With respect to any other business that may
properly come before the special meeting and be submitted to a
vote of stockholders, proxies will be voted in accordance with
the best judgment of the designated proxy holders.



Stockholders of record may vote by either
completing and returning the enclosed proxy card prior to the
special meeting, voting in person at the special meeting, or
submitting a signed proxy card at the special meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please
sign and return the accompanying proxy card whether or not you
plan to attend the special meeting in person.

You may revoke your proxy at any time before it
is actually voted at the meeting by:

 

delivering written notice of revocation to
    Computer Motions Secretary at 130-B Cremona Drive, Goleta,
    California 93117;

 

submitting a later dated proxy; or

 

attending the special meeting and voting in
    person.

Your attendance at the special meeting will not,
by itself, constitute revocation of your proxy. You may also be
represented by another person present at the special meeting by
executing a form of proxy designating that person to act on your
behalf. Shares may only be voted by or on behalf of the record
holder of shares as indicated in Computer Motions stock
transfer records. If you are a beneficial owner but your shares
are held of record by another person, such as a stock brokerage
firm or bank, that person must vote the shares as the record
holder in accordance with the beneficial holders
instructions.

All votes cast at the annual meeting will be
tabulated by the persons appointed by us to act as inspectors of
election for the special meeting.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Shares represented by proxies that reflect
abstentions or broker non-votes (i.e., shares held
by a broker or nominee which are represented at the meeting, but
with respect to which the broker or nominee is not empowered to
vote on a particular proposal) will be counted as shares that
are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum and will have the effect of votes cast
against approval and adoption of the merger agreement at the
Computer Motion special meeting for purposes of determining
whether stockholder approval of the merger agreement has been
obtained.

Proxy Solicitation

This solicitation is made on behalf of Computer
Motions board of directors and Computer Motion will pay
the costs of solicitation, except that Intuitive Surgical and
Computer Motion have each agreed to pay one-half of the costs of
filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and related proxy materials. Computer
Motions directors, officers and employees may also solicit
proxies by telephone, telegraph, fax or personal interview.
Computer Motion will not pay any additional compensation to
directors, officers or other employees for such services, but
may reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with such solicitation. Computer Motion will
reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees
and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in
sending proxy material to its stockholders.

Other Business, Adjournments

As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the Computer Motion board of directors
does not know of any matter that will be presented for
consideration at the Computer Motion special meeting other than
as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If the
special meeting is adjourned for any reason, the approval of any
of the proposals may be considered and voted upon by
stockholders at the subsequent reconvened meeting, if any.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance
    with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or

    stock subject to options and warrants which are currently
    exercisable, or will become exercisable within 60 days of
    February 28,



2003, are deemed outstanding for computing the
    percentage of the person or entity holding such securities but
    are not outstanding for computing the percentage of any other
    person or entity. Applicable percentage ownership after the
    merger is based on an estimated 51,801,591 shares of
    Intuitive Surgical common stock expected to be outstanding upon
    completion of the merger (without giving effect to the proposed
    reverse stock split). Except as indicated by footnote, and
    subject to the community property laws where applicable, to
    Intuitive Surgicals knowledge the persons named in the
    table above have sole voting and investment power with respect
    to all shares of Intuitive Surgical common stock shown as
