                        , 2003 

To the Stockholders of K2 Inc. and Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc.: 

The boards of directors of K2 Inc. (K2) and Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. (Rawlings) have approved a merger combining K2 and Rawlings. The
merger will combine two companies with strong sporting goods brands and market positions, increasing the combined companys aggregate brand strength and creating a platform to leverage their respective core competencies. The combined company
will be a preeminent designer, manufacturer and marketer of sporting goods and other recreational products. In order to complete the merger, both companies must obtain the approval of their stockholders. The directors of both companies believe that
this merger will be of great benefit to stockholders and strongly recommend that stockholders approve the proposed transaction. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 will merge with and into Rawlings, and Rawlings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2. In the merger, each outstanding share of Rawlings common stock will
be converted into a fraction of a share of K2 common stock based on an exchange ratio equal to 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings common stock. However, if the average daily closing price per share of K2 common stock for
the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the closing date (1) is less than $9.47, then the exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $9.00 by the average daily closing price of K2 common stock
during that fifteen day period, or (2) is greater than $10.53, then the exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $10.00 by the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during that fifteen day period. In addition, outstanding Rawlings
stock options will be assumed by K2. K2 common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KTO. Rawlings common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market System under the symbol RAWL.

SUMMARY 

This brief summary highlights selected information from this document. It
does not contain all of the information that is important to K2 and Rawlings stockholders. Stockholders of K2 and Rawlings are urged to read carefully the entire document and the other documents referred to and incorporated by reference in this
document to fully understand the merger. In particular, stockholders of K2 and Rawlings should read the documents attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A. For a guide as to
where you can obtain more information on K2 and Rawlings, see Additional InformationWhere You Can Find Additional Information on page 93. 

The Merger
(Page 33) 

The boards of directors of K2 and Rawlings propose that K2 and Rawlings combine by way of a merger
that will result in Rawlings becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 and Rawlings stockholders becoming K2 stockholders. K2 and Rawlings expect to complete the merger no later than March 31, 2003. 

The merger agreement is attached to this document as Appendix A. It is the legal document that governs the merger. 

Exchange of Common Stock (Page 58) 

When the merger occurs, each outstanding share of Rawlings common stock will be converted into a fraction of a share of K2 common stock based on an exchange ratio equal to 0.950 of a share of
K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings common stock. However, if the average daily closing price per share of K2 common stock for the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the closing date
(1) is less than $9.47, then the exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $9.00 by the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during that fifteen day period, or (2) is greater than $10.53, then the exchange ratio will be calculated by
dividing $10.00 by the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during that fifteen day period. Rawlings stockholders who would otherwise receive a fractional share as a result of the above determination will instead receive a cash payment
equal to the value of the fractional share based on multiplying the closing price of a share of K2 common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day the merger becomes effective by the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. 

The precise amount of K2 common stock that Rawlings stockholders will receive cannot be
determined until the completion of the merger. K2 and Rawlings will issue a joint press release on or before the date of the completion of the merger that specifies the exact amount of K2 common stock that will be paid for each share of Rawlings
common stock. 

K2 stock certificates will be issued only upon the surrender of the Rawlings stock certificates for
the shares to be exchanged. Rawlings stockholders will receive written instructions for the exchange of certificates after the merger is completed. 

Rawlings Stock Options (Page 59) 

In the merger, each stock option to buy Rawlings common
stock will become an option to buy K2 common stock; however, each stock option will continue to be governed by the terms of the Rawlings stock option plan or other agreement under which it was issued. The number of shares of K2 common stock
subject to each new stock option, as well as the exercise price of that stock option, will be adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares of K2 common stock issued in the merger in exchange for each share of Rawlings common stock. 

Comparative Per Share Market Price Information (Page 16) 

Shares of K2 common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On December 13, 2002, the last trading day before K2 and Rawlings announced the merger, K2 common stock
closed at $9.87 per share. Shares of Rawlings common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National Market System. On December 13, 2002, Rawlings common stock closed at $8.18 per share. On
                        ,

SUMMARY

$         per share.

Rawlings
Sporting Goods Company, Inc. (Page 73) 

1859 Bowles Avenue 

Fenton, Missouri

(314) 349-3500

Rawlings common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market System (symbol: RAWL). Rawlings is headquartered in Fenton, Missouri. 

Ownership of the Combined Company After the Merger 

Assuming that the exchange ratio is 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings common stock and the K2 stock price at the closing of the merger is between $9.47 and $10.53, the number of shares of K2 common
stock issued to Rawlings stockholders in the merger will constitute approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company after the merger. 

SUMMARY



Record Date for Voting; Required Votes for the Stockholder Proposals (Pages 28 and 31)

K2 Stockholders 

Each holder of record, as of
                        , 2003, of K2 common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share. The affirmative vote, in person or by
proxy, of at least a majority of the votes properly cast, is required to approve the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger. The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares outstanding as of the record date is
required to approve the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2 from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares. The approval by K2 stockholders of the amendment to K2s certificate of
incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2 is not a condition to the completion of the merger. Failure of K2s stockholders to approve this proposal would not affect consummation of the merger. K2 directors and executive
officers beneficially hold approximately 5.1% of the outstanding shares of K2 common stock. 

Rawlings
Stockholders 

Each holder of record, as of
                        , 2003, of Rawlings common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share. The affirmative vote, in person
or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Rawlings common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the merger and the merger agreement. Rawlings directors and executive officers beneficially hold approximately 14% of
the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

Effects of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

Both abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present at the K2 and Rawlings
meeting. 

Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the K2 vote to approve the
issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, assuming a quorum is present. However, because the vote at the K2 meeting required to approve the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2
from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares is based upon a percentage of the total outstanding voting power of K2 rather than upon the percentage of the votes cast at the K2 meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
against the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation. 

Since the vote at the Rawlings meeting required
to approve and adopt the merger agreement is based upon a percentage of the total outstanding voting power of Rawlings rather than upon the percentage of the votes cast at the Rawlings meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. 

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger

K2 and Rawlings may terminate the
merger agreement by mutual written consent.

various conditions, if: 



any governmental entity or court issues a nonappealable final order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions set forth in

stockholders meeting is less than $8.00.

agreement and to recommend that K2 stockholders approve the issuance of the shares of K2 common stock to be issued in the merger were the result of careful consideration by the board of directors of numerous factors. Significant factors considered
by the K2 board of directors include, among others: 



Strategic Growth Through Acquisition
.    The consolidation of sporting goods retailers worldwide is leading to a consolidation of
sporting goods suppliers. K2 believes that the most successful sporting goods suppliers will be those with greater financial resources and a broader selection of products and brands. The merger with Rawlings furthers K2s strategy of expanding
its operations, diversifying its product offerings and adding strong brands through combinations with well-established companies. 



Key Platform For Growth.    
One key market segment into which K2 plans to expand is the team sports segment. Because of its strong
product lines, expertise in the category and brand name recognition, Rawlings represents a premier platform for K2s entry into the team sports segment. 



Increased Market Presence and Opportunities.    
As the sporting goods industry consolidates, the large sporting goods retailers
prefer to rely on fewer and larger sporting goods suppliers to help them manage the supply of products and the allocation of shelf space. The combination of K2s and Rawlings leading brands and product offerings will provide K2 with a
broader product offering and an increased market presence that will help K2 address the needs of the large sporting goods retailers. 



Operating Synergies.    
The combination of K2 and Rawlings will create synergies by providing opportunities to leverage the
companies strengths in distribution, manufacturing, administration, product development and marketing. 



Enhanced Management Team.    
K2 and Rawlings each enjoy top quality management teams that understand their respective market
segments. The combination of Rawlings and K2 creates an enhanced management team by combining the strengths and experience of both companies management teams. 



Reduced Seasonality and Exposure to Weather
.    Some of K2s business lines are seasonal in nature. K2s results of
operations are typically impacted by the amount of snowfall during the winter months, which drives the sale of skis and snowboards. The addition of Rawlings businesses, which focus on spring and summer sports, will reduce K2s relative
exposure to the impact of snowfall in the winter months. Overall, the broader range of sporting goods products of the combined company will counter balance the seasonal nature of K2s and Rawlings product lines. 



Greater Liquidity
.    As a result of the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, there will be a larger public float and
greater liquidity with respect to K2s common stock following the merger. 

SUMMARY



Rawlings Reasons for the Merger 

The Rawlings board of directors has determined to vote in favor of the merger, approve the merger agreement, declare the advisability of
the merger and recommend that Rawlings stockholders approve the merger agreement for the following reasons, among others: 



Financially Superior.
    The merger is financially superior to other alternatives for Rawlings stockholders
.



Terms of Merger Agreement.    
The merger agreement includes provisions validating the financial superiority of the merger because the
Rawlings board of directors may, among other things, terminate the merger agreement and enter into an agreement for a transaction with a third party that is financially superior to the merger if the Rawlings board of directors determines in good
faith that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duty, K2 has not submitted a revised offer that is at least as favorable to Rawlings stockholders as the third party proposal, and Rawlings pays a
termination fee of $2,900,000 to K2
. 



Fairness Opinion.    
The opinion of George K. Baum & Company that, as of the date the merger agreement was executed and based
upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair to the holders of Rawlings common stock, from a financial point of view
. 



Greater Liquidity.    
The greater liquidity of K2s common stock following the merger as compared to Rawlings common
stock. 



Strategic Benefits.    
The merger is expected to produce financial, strategic and operational benefits that could reasonably be
expected to enhance the value of the stock in the combined company
. 



Tax-Free Structure.    
The structure of the transaction will permit Rawlings stockholders to defer payment of capital gains taxes
until they sell the shares of K2 common stock received in the merger.

Board Recommendations (Pages 44
and 45) 

K2 Stockholders 

The K2 board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of K2 stockholders and recommends that K2 stockholders vote 
FOR
 the issuance
of shares of K2 common stock in the merger and 
FOR
 an amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2 from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares. 

Rawlings Stockholders 

The Rawlings board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Rawlings stockholders and recommends that Rawlings stockholders vote 
FOR
 approval and adoption of
the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Opinion of Rawlings Financial Advisor (Page 48) 

Rawlings financial advisor, George K. Baum & Company, delivered a written opinion to the Rawlings board of directors as to the
fairness of the merger consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Rawlings common stock. The full text of George K. Baums written opinion, dated December 15, 2002, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix B. K2 and Rawlings encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. 
George K. Baums opinion is
addressed to the Rawlings board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations (Page 53) 

It is a condition to the
merger that both K2 and Rawlings receive legal opinions from their respective tax counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of 

Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

SUMMARY



as amended. Assuming that the merger so qualifies, Rawlings stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss except for gain or loss attributable to cash received by Rawlings stockholders instead
of fractional shares of K2 common stock. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the merger to them. 

Accounting Treatment (Page 54) 

K2 will use the purchase
method of accounting for the merger with Rawlings under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger 

(Page 55) 

Certain Rawlings directors, officers and stockholders have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of other stockholders. These interests include: (1) current and future employment arrangements,
(2) the acceleration of the vesting period of stock options held by employees of Rawlings upon consummation of the transaction, (3) severance agreements of twenty-five of the employees of Rawlings providing payments to the employees under certain
circumstances after the merger, (4) the post-merger membership on K2s board of directors of one of the current directors of Rawlings and (5) the indemnification of directors and officers of Rawlings against certain liabilities both before and
after the merger. The members of the boards of directors of K2 and Rawlings knew about these interests and considered them, among other matters, when they approved the merger agreement and the merger. 

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals (Page 55) 

The completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. 

No Dissenters Appraisal Rights (Page 56) 

Neither the K2 stockholders nor the Rawlings stockholders are entitled to dissenters appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Amendment to K2s Certificate of Incorporation (Page 29) 

K2 stockholders are also being asked to vote on an amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2 from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares. Stockholder approval of this amendment to
K2s certificate of incorporation is not required for K2 and Rawlings to complete the merger. 

The increase
in authorized common stock will provide K2 with additional flexibility to take timely advantage of favorable opportunities and to meet its future business needs, including, among other things, future acquisitions. If authorized shares are issued,
the issuance of such additional K2 common stock could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of the K2 common stock currently outstanding and on the equity and voting power of existing holders of K2 common stock at the time of issuance.

Trading of Common Stock (Page 56) 

The shares of K2 common stock issued in connection with the merger will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1997, a pre-tax restructuring charge of $2,400,000 was recorded
in connection with the announcement of K2s plan to consolidate its mountain bike and outdoor equipment operations into its existing facility on Vashon Island, Washington, and to move its production of outdoor products to outside sources.

In 1998, K2 adopted a plan to dispose of its Simplex building products division. As a result, K2 reclassified
Simplex as a discontinued operation in 1998 and similarly reclassified prior years operations. On June 30, 2000, K2 completed the sale of the assets and business of Simplex to Ludlow Building Products, a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.

In the third quarter of 1998, a pre-tax charge of $14,500,000 was included in earnings from continuing
operations. Of this amount, $10,500,000 was charged to cost of products sold to write down certain categories of bike and skate inventories as a result of a sudden change in the market demand for those products. The balance of

SUMMARY



the charge was recorded in general and administrative expenses for costs associated with the change in the bike business and implementing planned cost reduction programs at the winter sports
operations. The charges primarily related to non-cash items. 

In 1999, K2 began to reduce the cost structure of
its ski and snowboard operations by restructuring and downsizing its Seattle manufacturing operation in favor of lower cost manufacturing and sourcing opportunities. In accordance with the initiative, during 1999, K2s Seattle manufacturing
facility was downsized and approximately half of its ski and all of its snowboard manufacturing were moved to either K2s China or California production facilities or to third party sourcing operations worldwide, resulting in a charge of
$10,500,000 to cost of products sold to cover restructuring costs of $6,500,000 and downsizing costs of $4,000,000. The restructuring charge reflected expenses associated with the write-off of related equipment and inventory, the reduction of
approximately 200 production personnel and the utilization of approximately 200 temporary workers. Approximately $5,300,000 of the total amount was a cash charge to earnings. 

During 2001, in ongoing cost reduction moves, K2 completed the move of its remaining ski production to China, closing the Washington ski manufacturing facility during the
2001 third quarter. In addition, three other smaller manufacturing facilities which serviced the Stearns and Hilton operations were shut down in Minnesota and Alabama, with most of the production also moving overseas. In addition to the factory
closures, K2 experienced a substantial industry-wide slowdown of sales of small-wheeled products in 2001, necessitating a downsizing of K2s small-wheeled products operation. Consequently, the factory closures and downsizing activities have
resulted in 2001 charges to cost of products sold and general and administrative expenses for restructuring and downsizing costs of $15,600,000 and $2,400,000, respectively. Approximately $5,000,000 of the total amount was a charge to earnings that
resulted in or will result in a cash payment. These costs are associated with the reduction of personnel, the write down of facilities and equipment, and the reduction in the net carrying value of small-wheeled products inventory.

For the year ended August 31, 2000, Rawlings recorded the write-off
of deferred debt issuance costs of $646,000 as an extraordinary item associated with the refinancing of an existing financing arrangement. 

In June 2000, Rawlings made a strategic decision to seek a buyer for the Vic hockey business and similarly reclassified the segment as discontinued operations during the year ended August 31, 2000. The loss from discontinued
operations for the years ended August 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 include operating losses of the segment, a write-down of assets of the business to estimated net realizable value and estimated costs of disposal. The sale of the business was completed
during the third quarter of fiscal 2001.

SUMMARY



Unaudited Comparative Per Common Share Data 

The following table on page 14 summarizes the per share information for K2 and Rawlings on an historical basis and on an unaudited pro-forma combined basis. The pro
forma data gives effect to the merger on a purchase method basis as described in Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information beginning on page 96. The pro forma information is presented as if the merger was completed as
of the beginning of each period for income statement purposes and on September 30, 2002 for balance sheet purposes. All pro forma information herein is audited. 

The historical book value per common share is computed by dividing total stockholders equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period. The pro forma combined
book value per common share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders equity by the pro forma number of shares of K2 common stock outstanding at the end of the period. 

The information listed as pro forma combined per equivalent share was obtained by multiplying the pro forma amounts by the assumed exchange ratio in the merger.

K2 and Rawlings expect to incur merger and integration charges as a result of combining the companies. K2 and
Rawlings also anticipate that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that include reduced operating expenses and the opportunity to earn more revenue. The pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the
financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect these expenses or benefits and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not necessarily reflect what the
historical results of the combined company would have been had K2 and Rawlings actually been combined during the periods presented. 

The information in the following table is based on, and should be read together with, the K2 and Rawlings historical financial information contained in prior Securities and Exchange Commission filings, which are incorporated
herein by reference, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information beginning on page 96.

These calculations are based on an exchange ratio of 0.950 of a share of K2 stock to be issued per each Rawlings share or stock option outstanding. This
exchange ratio assumes an average share price for K2 common stock of between $9.47 per share and $10.53 per share, which represents the floor and ceiling price within which the exchange ratio is fixed. If the average share price of K2 common stock
for the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on and including the second day preceding the closing date is less than $9.47 per share, the exchange ratio will be adjusted upward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders
receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock having a value of $9.00 per share of

SUMMARY



Rawlings stock exchanged based on the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during the specified period. If the average share price of K2 common stock exceeds $10.53 per share, the
exchange ratio will be adjusted downward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock having a value of $10.00 per share of Rawlings stock exchanged based on the average daily closing
price of K2 common stock during the specified period.

Calculations based on an assumed K2 average share price of $8.00 per share, which would result in an exchange ratio of 1.125 shares of K2 stock for each
Rawlings share or stock option outstanding.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



RISK FACTORS 

Stockholders of K2 and Rawlings should carefully consider the following
factors, in addition to other risk factors of the two companies incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other information contained in this document, in deciding whether to vote for approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger, in the case of Rawlings stockholders, or for approval of the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, in the case of K2 stockholders. See Additional InformationWhere You Can Find Additional
Information on page 93 for where you can find the additional risk factors incorporated by reference. 

Risk Factors Relating to the Merger 

K2 and Rawlings may not successfully integrate their business
operations after the merger. 

The integration of K2s and Rawlings operations after the merger
may be difficult, time consuming and costly. After completion of the merger, the combined company must successfully integrate, among other things, the product and service offerings, product development, sales and marketing, research and development,
administrative and customer service functions, and the management information systems of Rawlings with those of K2. In addition, K2 will need to retain the management, key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of
both companies. It is possible that these integration efforts will not be completed as smoothly as planned, which could have an adverse impact on the operations of the combined company. 

K2 expects to incur potentially significant merger-related, restructuring and integration costs in connection with the transaction and the integration of Rawlings operations.

K2 and Rawlings expect to incur costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies,
transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. These costs include those related to the severance agreements of twenty-five of Rawlings employees which could be triggered by certain actions taken by K2 after the merger. These severance
agreements could require payments by K2 totaling in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate and could lead to the possible loss of some key employees. K2 also faces potential costs related to employee redeployment or relocation, reorganization or
closure of facilities, relocation and disposition of excess equipment and other integration costs. K2 has not yet determined the amount of these costs. K2 expects to account for these costs as purchase related adjustments when the merger is
completed. 

Changes in the market value of K2 common stock may increase the costs of the transaction to K2 stockholders or
adversely affect the value of consideration that Rawlings stockholders receive for their stock. 

The value
of the K2 common stock to be issued in the merger in exchange for each share of Rawlings common stock is based on a number of factors and cannot be determined precisely before completion of the merger. Generally, as the value of K2 common stock
decreases, the dilution to existing K2 stockholders increases. In addition, the value received for each share of Rawlings common stock decreases as the K2 stock price decreases, until the K2 common stock price decreases below $9.47, at which point
the exchange ratio will be adjusted upward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock having a value of $9.00 per share for each share of Rawlings common stock exchanged, based on
the average daily closing price for K2 common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the fifteen trading days ending on and including the second trading day prior to the closing of the merger. However, the collar mechanism does not protect against
a decline in the value of K2 common stock following the completion of the merger. 

RISK FACTORS



The following chart demonstrates how changes in the market value of K2 common
stock will affect the exchange ratio in the merger, the percentage ownership of existing K2 stockholders of the combined company and the value received by Rawlings stockholders. K2 has the right to terminate the merger agreement if the average daily
closing price per share of K2 common stock for any consecutive fifteen trading days ending at least two calendar days prior to the stockholders meeting is less than $8.00.

(2)

Assumes that the actual price of K2 common stock at the effective time of the merger equals the average daily closing price. 

The trading price of K2 common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. The future trading price of K2 common stock is
likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to such factors, including: 



actual or anticipated fluctuations in revenues or operating results; 



failure to meet securities analysts or investors expectations of performance; 



changes in key management personnel; 



announcements of technological innovations or new products by K2 or its competitors; 



developments in or disputes regarding patents and proprietary rights; 



proposed and completed acquisitions by K2 or its competitors; 



the mix of products and services sold; 



the timing, placement and fulfillment of significant orders; 



product and service pricing and discounts; 



acts of war or terrorism; and 



general economic conditions. 

Rawlings stockholders may receive a lower return on their investment after the merger. 

Although K2 and Rawlings believe that the merger will create financial, operational and strategic benefits for the combined company and its stockholders, these benefits may not be achieved. The combination of K2s and
Rawlings businesses, even if conducted in an efficient, effective and timely manner, may not result in combined operating efficiencies and financial performance that are better than what each company would have achieved independently if the
merger had not occurred. In addition, the issuance of K2 common stock in the merger could reduce the market price of K2 common stock.

RISK FACTORS



Rawlings directors and officers have conflicts of interest in recommending the merger to
Rawlings stockholders. 

In considering the recommendation of the Rawlings board of directors to approve
the merger, Rawlings stockholders should recognize that some of Rawlings directors and officers have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as Rawlings stockholders. These interests include (1) current
and future employment arrangements, (2) severance benefits, (3) acceleration of stock options, (4) K2 board membership for one of Rawlings current directors and (5) indemnification of directors and officers of Rawlings against certain
liabilities arising both before and after the merger. These and additional interests are described under the headings The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger on page 55. 

Rawlings stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger. 

After completion of the merger, Rawlings stockholders will own a significantly smaller percentage of the combined company and its voting stock than they currently own
of Rawlings. Consequently, Rawlings stockholders will not be able to exercise as much influence over the management and policies of the combined company as they currently exercise over Rawlings. 

K2 could lose key Rawlings personnel necessary to achieve the benefits K2 and Rawlings expect as a result of the merger. 

Rawlings contribution to the combined companys success will depend in part on the continued service of specific Rawlings personnel. If a substantial
portion of Rawlings management or key employees leave after K2 and Rawlings complete the merger, the combined companys business could be adversely affected. 

Failure to complete the merger could be costly to Rawlings and its stockholders. 

If the merger is not completed for any reason: 



the price of Rawlings common stock may decline, assuming that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and



Rawlings must still pay its costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees.

In addition, the merger agreement provides for the payment by Rawlings of a termination fee of $2,900,000 if the merger is
terminated under certain circumstances. The obligation to make that payment may adversely affect the ability of Rawlings to engage in another transaction and may have an adverse impact on the financial condition of Rawlings. See The Merger
AgreementTermination and Termination Fee on page 69. 

Risk Factors and Trends Affecting the Combined Company 

K2s strategic plan involving the
acquisition of various additional companies may not succeed. 

K2s strategic plan involves growth
through the acquisition of a number of additional companies within a relatively short period of time. Growth through acquisition, particularly rapid growth through acquisition, involves a number of risks, including: 



difficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit; 



the substantial diversion of managements attention from day-to-day business when negotiating these transactions and later integrating an acquired
business; 



the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business discovered after the transaction is complete; 



the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; 

RISK FACTORS





the risks of highly leveraging the company or engaging in dilutive issuances of equity securities of the company in order to fund the acquisitions; and



difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business, for example, in manufacturing, distribution, engineering and customer support areas.

K2 cannot assure the stockholders of the respective companies that any transaction or series
of transactions that are completed will result in long-term benefits to the combined company or its stockholders, or that K2s management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively. 

K2s proposed new bank credit facility, as well as the refinancing of Rawlings debt under that facility, will place a significant debt burden on the
combined company. 

After the merger, it is anticipated that the combined company will have substantially
more indebtedness than K2 currently has based on the anticipated draws on K2s new bank credit facility to accommodate the working capital requirements of Rawlings. See Recent Developments on page 27. K2s indebtedness as of
September 30, 2002 was approximately $97,400,000. K2s pro forma indebtedness as of September 30, 2002 after giving effect to the merger and its new bank credit facility is expected to be approximately $127,400,000. As a result of the
increase in debt, demands on the cash resources of the combined company will increase after the merger, which could have important effects on an investment in K2s common stock. For example, the increased levels of indebtedness could, among
other things: 



adversely affect the combined companys ability to expand its business, market its products and make investments in capital expenditures; 



adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders, debt financing transactions and other sources; 



adversely affect the ability of the combined company to pursue its acquisition strategy; and 



create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels. 

The combined companys inability to compete in its competitive industry could seriously harm its business. 

The markets for sporting goods and recreational products in which K2 and Rawlings compete are generally highly competitive, especially as to product innovation, performance
and styling, price, marketing and delivery. Competition regarding these products, other than active wear, consists of a relatively small number of large producers, some of whom have greater financial and other resources than the combined company. In
addition, many of the combined companys competitors offer sports and recreational equipment not currently sold by either K2 or Rawlings. In addition, there are no significant technological or capital barriers to entry into the markets for many
sporting goods and recreational products and these markets face competition from other leisure activities. The sales of leisure products are also affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict.

K2s industrial products are, in most instances, subject to price competition, ranging from moderate in
marine antennas and monofilament line to intense for commodity-type products. Many industrial competitors have greater financial and other resources than K2. 

K2s financial results vary from quarter to quarter, which could hurt K2s business and the market price of its stock. 

Various factors affect K2s quarterly operating results and some of them are not within K2s control. They include, among others: 



weather and snow conditions; 



the timing and introduction of new products; 

RISK FACTORS





the mix of products and services sold; 



the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers; 



product pricing and discounts; 



the timing of its acquisitions of other companies and businesses; and 



general economic conditions. 

These and other factors are likely to cause financial results of the combined company to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. If revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and
investors, the trading price of K2 common stock could decline dramatically. Based on the foregoing, K2 believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful. Therefore, Rawlings stockholders should not view
K2s historical results of operations as reliable indications of its future performance. 

The combined companys failure
to develop or acquire new products and improve its existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with the development in its industries could seriously harm its business. 

Consumer demand for recreational products is strongly influenced by matters of taste and style. K2 cannot assure the companies respective stockholders that the
combined company will be able to successfully develop new products to address new consumer demand. The combined companys inability to timely and successfully respond to developments and changing styles could hurt its competitive position or
render its products noncompetitive. 

An unexpected change in consumer tastes or a change in product demand could
seriously harm K2s business. K2 cannot assure you that demand for its products will remain constant. 

International
operations may seriously harm K2s financial condition because of weak foreign economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 

K2s revenues from international operations were approximately 36% of total revenue for fiscal 2002, and approximately 32% of K2s sales are denominated in foreign currencies. K2 expects that
revenues from the combined companys international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues. In addition, the combined company will outsource a number of its supply contracts to entities in foreign
nations, including China and Costa Rica. The combined companys international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: 



recessions in foreign economies; 



the adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions; 



currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations; 



limitations on repatriation of earnings; 



reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; 



longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; 



difficulties in managing foreign operations; 



social, political and economic instability; 



unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 



acts of war and terrorism; 

RISK FACTORS





ability to finance foreign operations; 



changes in consumer tastes and trends; 



tariffs and other trade barriers; and 



U.S. government licensing requirements for export. 

Conflicts related to intellectual property could seriously harm the combined companys business. 

A third party may try to challenge, invalidate or circumvent K2s or Rawlings patents, copyrights or trademarks. K2 cannot assure the companies respective stockholders that any of the
rights granted under the patents, copyrights or trademarks will provide competitive advantages to the combined company, that patents will be issued on its pending applications, or that claims allowed on any of its future patents will be sufficiently
broad to protect the combined companys technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect K2s and Rawlings proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, the combined
company cannot rely solely on patent, copyright and trademark protection to be successful and profitable in the industry. 

K2s inability to obtain licenses may harm its business. 

Many of K2s
products include intellectual property licensed from third parties, and in many instances K2 will have to seek new or renew existing licenses in the future. The inability to obtain such licenses or other rights on favorable terms, or the need to
engage in litigation over such licenses or rights, could seriously harm K2s business, operating results and financial condition. 

Rawlings business, which will be integral to the success of the combined company, is highly dependent on sales of baseball related products to only a few main customers. 

Sales of baseball-related products constituted approximately 63% of Rawlings total net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002.
Adverse publicity or news coverage regarding professional or amateur baseball and strikes or other work stoppages initiated by owners, athletes or umpires could create fan disaffection and disillusionment that could have a material adverse effect on
the combined companys sales. The loss of the Major League Baseball exclusive supplier contract could also have a material adverse effect on the combined companys sales, as could poor weather conditions during the peak baseball
retail-selling season in the spring. 

Sales to Rawlings ten largest customers constituted approximately 43%
of Rawlings total net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002, including one customer, Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 17% of Rawlings 2002 net revenues. Although Rawlings has long-established relationships with many of
its customers, it does not have long-term supply contracts with them and neither Rawlings nor K2 can predict what effect the merger will have on these relationships. A decrease in business from any of its major customers could have a material
adverse effect on the combined companys business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Anti-takeover defenses in
K2s charter and under Delaware law could prevent an acquisition of K2 or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for K2 common stock. 

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period
of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless specific conditions are met. In addition, K2 has in place various types of protections which would make it difficult for a company or investor to buy K2 without the
approval of K2s board of directors, including a shareholder rights plan, a classified board of directors, provisions requiring advance notice of board nominations and other actions to be taken at stockholder meetings and super-majority voting
requirements with respect to extraordinary actions. See Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of K2 and Common Stockholders of RawlingsRights PlanK2 on page 91. All of the foregoing could hinder,

RISK FACTORS



delay or prevent a change in control of K2 and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of K2 common stock. 

Acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on the combined companys business. 

Acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on the economy generally, and more specifically on the combined companys business. The recent economic
slowdown and the terrorist attacks throughout the world have not yet had a material adverse effect on either K2s or Rawlings business; however, because such occurrences have the potential to significantly decrease consumer spending on
leisure products and activities, K2 and Rawlings are not able to say that such a material adverse effect on the combined company will not take place in the future. And, because of the uncertainty of such events, K2 and Rawlings are unable to predict
with any certainty any future adverse impact from a prolonged weak economy, war or terrorists attacks. 

The loss of a key license
or the loss of a key licensee by Rawlings could negatively impact the results of operations. 

Rawlings has
the exclusive licenses to provide baseballs to certain organizations, including Major League Baseball. Additionally, Rawlings licenses its trademarks to various companies which provides Rawlings with significant royalty income. The loss of any of
these important arrangements could have a negative impact on the combined companys results. 

RISK FACTORS



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

K2s Junior Subordinated Debentures 

On December 10, 2002, K2 entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which K2 has the right, and the obligation under specified circumstances, to issue $25,000,000 of its convertible subordinated debentures due in March, 2010. K2 intends to use the proceeds from the
debentures to refinance its existing indebtedness and for general working capital purposes. The convertible subordinated debentures are convertible at any time at the option of the holders into shares of K2 common stock at a conversion price equal
to $11.92 per share. The convertible subordinated debentures may also be converted into K2 common stock at the option of K2 in certain circumstances. The convertible subordinated debentures include covenants which restrict K2s ability, among
other things, to make distributions to stockholders, to make loans, to incur indebtedness and to repurchase its capital stock. 

K2s Proposed Credit Facility 

K2 has entered into a non-binding letter of intent
with Bank One, NA for a new bank credit facility that will provide for aggregate borrowings by K2 of up to $160,000,000. K2 intends to increase the facility to $225,000,000 to accommodate the working capital requirements of Rawlings. The proposed
credit facility will have a term of three years, and amounts borrowed under the proposed credit facility will be secured by all of the assets of K2 and its domestic subsidiaries, including the assets of Rawlings following the merger, as well as the
stock of certain of K2s foreign subsidiaries. The proposed credit facility will be used by K2 to refinance existing indebtedness, including the existing bank indebtedness of Rawlings following the merger, to fund future acquisitions and for
general working capital purposes. The proposed bank credit facility will include covenants that will place significant restrictions on K2s operations, including restrictions on, among other things, dividends, stock repurchases, indebtedness,
mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, investments, loans, liens and encumbrances, transactions with affiliates and capital expenditures. Although K2 intends to obtain the new credit facility prior to the completion of the merger, entering into
the new credit facility is not a condition to the closing of the merger. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



THE K2 SPECIAL MEETING 

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection
with the solicitation of proxies from K2 common stockholders by the K2 board of directors for use at the special meeting of K2 stockholders. 

Time and Place; Purpose 

The special meeting will be held on
                        , 2003 at [place], [address], at 9:30 a.m., Pacific time. At the special meeting, K2 common stockholders
will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals: 



to approve the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger; 



to approve an amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of K2 from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares; and



any other business as may properly come before the special meeting. 

K2 stockholders also may be asked to vote upon a proposal to adjourn or postpone the K2 special meeting. K2 could use any adjournment or postponement of the K2 special
meeting for the purpose, among others, of allowing additional time for soliciting additional votes to approve the issuance of the shares of K2 common stock in the merger or to increase the authorized common stock of K2. 

Record Date and Outstanding Shares 

The K2 board of directors has fixed the close of
business on                         , 2003, as the record date for purposes of voting at the special meeting. Only holders of
record of shares of common stock on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were
                         shares of K2 common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting held by stockholders
of record. The record stockholder number does not include the number of persons whose stock is in nominee or street name accounts through brokers. 

Vote and Quorum Required 

Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of
common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes properly cast is required to approve the issuance of
shares in the merger. The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of K2 common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the
authorized common stock of K2 from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 shares, although the approval of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation is not a condition to the merger. As of December 31, 2002, directors and executive officers of K2 and
their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of 964,655 shares of K2 common stock entitled to vote at the K2 special meeting, or approximately 5.1% of the shares of K2 common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on such date. 

How Shares Will be Voted at the Special Meeting 

All shares of common stock represented
by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting, and not revoked, will be voted as specified in the proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted 
FOR
 the adoption
of the proposals set forth in the accompanying notice of special meeting. 

THE K2 SPECIAL MEETING



A properly executed proxy marked 
ABSTAIN
 with respect to any
proposal will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions will not affect the number of votes for or against the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, but will have
the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation. 

In the
event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of K2s common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a broker non-vote, those
shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the number of votes properly cast with respect to a particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of
a quorum for the transaction of business. As a result, if you fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will not affect the number of votes for or against the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, but will have the same effect
as a vote against the adoption of the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation. 

K2s board of
directors is not currently aware of any business to be acted upon at the special meeting other than the proposals described in the accompanying notice of special meeting. 

The people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies in favor of
approval of the issuance of the shares of K2 common stock in the merger and the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized common shares, except that no proxy which is voted against the approval of these proposals
will be voted in favor of any such adjournment. 

Methods of Voting 

All stockholders of record as of the record date may vote by mail by
signing, dating and mailing their proxies in the postage-paid envelope provided. 

How to Revoke a Proxy 

A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its
use by delivering to K2s secretary a signed notice of revocation or a later-dated signed proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute the revocation of a proxy.

Solicitation of Proxies 

The cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting
will be paid by K2. In addition to solicitation by mail, arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send proxy material to beneficial owners, and K2 will, upon request, reimburse them for their
reasonable expenses in so doing. K2 has retained Morrow & Company to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records related to the solicitations. Morrow & Company will receive a fee of approximately $7,000 plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses for such services. K2 or its representatives may request by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, telegram or over the Internet the return of proxy cards in order to ensure sufficient representation at the special meeting.
The extent to which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxy cards are returned. You are urged to send in your proxies without delay. 

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation 

K2s board of directors has approved an
amendment to the certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock which K2 is authorized to issue from 40,000,000 shares to 60,000,000 shares. The text of the proposed amendment is set forth as Appendix C hereto.
Stockholders are urged to read Appendix C. 

THE K2 SPECIAL MEETING



Description of the Proposed Amendment.
    K2s
certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of 40,000,000 shares of K2 common stock, of which 17,942,076 shares were issued and outstanding as of January 16, 2003. Of the remaining 22,057,924 unissued shares, as of
January 16, 2003, 4,508,640 shares were reserved for issuance under K2s stock option plans, outstanding warrants and convertible debentures. After giving effect to the approximately 10,782,026 shares of K2 common stock and
options to purchase common stock to be issued in the merger, there will be only approximately 6,767,258 shares of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock available for future issuance as of January 16, 2003. 

Purpose and Effect of the Proposed Amendment.
    While approval of the amendment to K2s
certificate of incorporation is not required to consummate the merger, the K2 board of directors believes that an increase of 20,000,000 shares to the total authorized common stock is in the best interests of K2 and its stockholders, and is
advisable to provide K2 with additional flexibility to meet its future business needs. If the proposed amendment to increase the number of authorized common shares is adopted by the K2 stockholders, K2 will have additional shares available for
acquisitions, equity financings, equity compensation plans, stock dividends or stock splits and other corporate purposes. The additional shares would be available for issuance without further stockholder approval, except as may be required by
applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Although K2 does not have any commitment or understanding at this time for the issuance of additional common shares, the proposed amendment should enable K2 to take timely advantage of
favorable opportunities and market conditions when they arise. 

The issuance of additional common shares could
have a dilutive effect on earnings per share of the K2 common stock currently outstanding and on the equity and voting power of existing holders of K2 common stock at the time of issuance. In addition, the proposed amendment could have an
anti-takeover effect, as additional common shares could be issued to dilute the stock ownership and voting power of, or increase the cost to, a person seeking to obtain control of K2. However, the amendment is not being proposed in response to any
known effort to accumulate common shares or to obtain control of K2. 

Recommendation of the K2 Board of Directors 

The K2 board of directors believes that
each of the proposals is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of K2 and the stockholders of K2. The members of K2s board of directors has approved each of the proposals and recommends that K2 stockholders vote 
FOR

the issuance of the shares of K2 common stock in the merger and 
FOR
 the amendment to K2s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000.

the special meeting, Rawlings common stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon: 



a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; and 



any other business as may properly come before the special meeting. 

Rawlings stockholders may also be asked to vote upon a proposal to adjourn or postpone the Rawlings special meeting. Rawlings could use any adjournment or postponement of
the Rawlings special meeting for the purpose, among others, of allowing additional time for soliciting additional votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Record Date and Outstanding Shares 

The Rawlings board of directors has fixed the close
of business on                         , 2003, as the record date for purposes of voting at the special meeting. Only holders of
record of shares of common stock on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were                  shares
of Rawlings common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting held by stockholders of record. The record stockholder number does not include the number of persons whose stock is in nominee or street name accounts
through brokers. 

Vote and Quorum Required 

Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of
common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Rawlings common stock
outstanding as of the record date is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. As of December 31, 2002, directors and executive officers of Rawlings and their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,262,466
shares of Rawlings common stock entitled to vote at the Rawlings special meeting or approximately 14% of the shares of Rawlings common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on such date. 

How Shares Will Be Voted at the Special Meeting 

All shares of common stock represented
by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting, and not revoked, will be voted as specified in the proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted 
FOR
 the adoption
of the proposals set forth in the accompanying notice of special meeting. 

A properly executed proxy marked

ABSTAIN
 with respect to any proposal will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions, however, will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of each of
the proposals. 

THE RAWLINGS SPECIAL MEETING



In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of
Rawlings common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the
number of votes properly cast with respect to a particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. As a result, if you
fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger. 

Rawlings board of directors is not currently aware of any business to be acted upon at the special meeting other than the proposal described in the accompanying notice of special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly
brought before the special meeting, or any adjournments or postponements of the meeting, the people appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote the shares represented by duly executed proxies according to their best judgment. 

The people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the special meeting to permit
further solicitations of proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger, except that no proxy which is voted against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
merger will be voted in favor of any such adjournment. 

Methods of Voting 

All stockholders of record as of the record date may vote by mail by
signing, dating and mailing their proxies in the postage-paid envelope provided. 

How to Revoke a Proxy 

A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its
use by delivering to Rawlings secretary a signed notice of revocation or a later-dated signed proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute the revocation of a
proxy. 

Solicitation of Proxies 

The cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting
will be paid by Rawlings. In addition to solicitation by mail, arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send proxy material to beneficial owners, and Rawlings will, upon request, reimburse
them for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Rawlings has retained Morrow & Company to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records related to the solicitations. Morrow & Company will receive a fee of approximately $7,000 plus
reasonable out-of-pocket expense for such services. Rawlings or its representatives may request by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, telegram or over the Internet the return of proxy cards in order to ensure sufficient representation at the
special meeting. The extent to which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxy cards are returned. You are urged to send in your proxies without delay. 

Recommendation of the Rawlings Board of Directors 

The Rawlings board of directors
believes that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Rawlings and the stockholders of Rawlings. Rawlings board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and recommends that Rawlings stockholders vote 
FOR
 the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. 

THE RAWLINGS SPECIAL MEETING



THE MERGER 

The following summary describes the proposed merger and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the merger agreement. The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

General 

The respective boards of directors of K2 and Rawlings have approved a merger
involving the two companies, which will have the effect of combining the businesses, stockholder groups and other constituencies of K2 and Rawlings. The combined company will be a preeminent designer, manufacturer and marketer of sporting goods
and other recreational products. In order to complete the merger, both companies must obtain the approval of their respective stockholders. 

The merger agreement provides that when the merger becomes effective, Lara Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2, will merge with and into Rawlings, with Rawlings continuing in
existence as the surviving corporation. Each share of Rawlings common stock issued and outstanding at the time the merger becomes effective will be converted into 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock, subject to certain adjustments discussed below.
Upon completion of the merger, Rawlings will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 and all market trading of Rawlings common stock will cease. 

Background of the Merger 

From November, 1997 through December, 2002, Rawlings engaged
in various discussions and negotiations with multiple parties regarding potential strategic transactions prior to entering into the merger agreement with K2, including the possible sale of Rawlings as well as possible strategic acquisitions. The
following discussion briefly summarizes the background of these contacts, as well as the background of the merger and the discussions and negotiations with K2. 

Rawlings Contacts with Bull Run Corporation 

From
March 1999 though January 13, 2000, Rawlings and Bull Run Corporation, then owner of approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock, held discussions regarding Bull Runs potential acquisition of all of the outstanding
shares of Rawlings common stock. Rawlings retained financial advisors to assist Rawlings in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives. When Bull Run was unable to provide a fully financed transaction proposal, Rawlings discontinued
its evaluation of the potential Bull Run acquisition and focused on its operating plan. 

On December 3, 2001, two
of Rawlings directors previously nominated by Bull Run pursuant to an agreement with Rawlings resigned. 

On
November 27, 2002, Rawlings issued a press release stating that Rawlings had received an expression of interest from a strategic acquirer and that Rawlings had adopted a new shareholder rights plan. As a result and pursuant to a contractual
obligation under a standstill agreement with Bull Run entered into in 1997 and amended in 1999, the Rawlings board of directors invited Bull Run to make an acquisition proposal. Bull Run sold all of its Rawlings common stock in open market sales on
December 19, 2002 without discussing the sales or any potential transaction with Rawlings. 

Rawlings
Contacts with Mr. Daniel Gilbert and Huffy Corporation from July, 2001 through October, 2002 

In July of 2001,
Mr. Daniel Gilbert, a partner in Camelot Ventures and Chairman of the Board of Quicken Loans, contacted Mr. Stephen OHara, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Rawlings, regarding Mr. Gilberts interest in a potential
investment in Rawlings. 

THE MERGER



On December 31, 2001, Mr. OHara met with Mr. Gilbert in Livonia, Michigan
to discuss Rawlings operations and Mr. Gilberts desire to acquire Rawlings common stock. 

On February
1, 2002, Mr. Gilbert filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report his ownership of 6.4% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

After preliminary discussions in January 2002 between Mr. OHara and Mr. Don Graber, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Huffy Corporation, Rawlings received an
unsolicited offer from Huffy to purchase the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock at a price ranging from $5.75 to $7.25 per share. 

On February 5, 2002, Mr. OHara met with and gave a tour of Rawlings facilities to Mr. Gilbert and his advisors. At that time, Mr. Gilbert suggested that Rawlings was undercapitalized and might benefit from
Mr. Gilberts acquisition of a substantial number of newly issued shares of Rawlings common stock. Mr. OHara informed Mr. Gilbert that the board of directors was open to considering such a proposal. 

On February 6, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met to discuss the interest expressed by both Huffy and by Mr. Gilbert. Stinson
Morrison Hecker LLP, Rawlings outside legal counsel, advised the board with respect to the boards fiduciary duties in both evaluating Mr. Gilberts expression of interest and the boards response thereto. At this meeting, the
board authorized Mr. OHara to retain outside financial advisors to assist the directors in analyzing any and all issues presented by the interest expressed by Huffy and Mr. Gilbert and Rawlings other strategic alternatives. The board
also concluded that the price range presented by Huffy was inadequate and instructed Mr. OHara to reject the Huffy offer, but to leave open the possibility of other alternatives with Huffy. 

On March 9, 2002, George K. Baum & Company was initially engaged to advise the board of directors on strategic alternatives and LaFlche & Company, LLC
was engaged by Rawlings as a strategic consultant. On May 30, 2002, George K. Baums engagement was expanded to also serve as the financial advisor to the board of directors and LaFlche & Company was engaged by George K. Baum
as a consultant. 

On March 14, 2002, Mr. Gilbert filed an amended Schedule 13D to report his ownership of 8.3% of
the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

On March 26, 2002, Mr. OHara and Mr. Baur, a director of
Rawlings, met with Mr. Graber to present Mr. Graber an opportunity to expand upon and provide greater information with respect to Huffys offer. 

On April 2, 2002, the Rawlings board met with the companys financial and legal advisors to further address appropriate actions to be taken in response to the continued interest expressed by Huffy
and Mr. Gilbert. George K. Baum and LaFlche & Company presented materials that addressed Rawlings range of possible strategic alternatives. 

On April 5, 2002, Mr. Gilbert made a verbal proposal to Mr. OHara to invest between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000 in shares of Rawlings common stock to be purchased
directly from Rawlings at the then current market value and to name two directors to Rawlings board of directors, which included naming himself as chairman of the board. 

On April 8, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors held a special meeting to discuss Mr. Gilberts proposal and also to discuss the potential need to adopt a
shareholder rights plan in light of, among other things, (1) the possible unequal treatment of Rawlings stockholders if a controlling block of the companys shares were acquired by Mr. Gilbert or others through a tender offer at a price higher
than that received by the holders of the remaining shares in a second step, squeeze out transaction and (2) the inadequacy of the Huffy offer. Rawlings financial advisor discussed the overtures made by Huffy and Mr. Gilbert. The board of
directors concluded that

THE MERGER



Mr. Gilberts overture was unappealing because of the potential unequal treatment of Rawlings stockholders and the dilutive effect of the proposed stock issuance. The board, having
previously determined that Huffys offer was inadequate, concluded that Huffy should be granted an opportunity to perform due diligence with a view to increasing its offer. 

On April 22, 2002, Mr. OHara, Mr. Baur and Mr. Ryan, another Rawlings director, met with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to better understand his interest in Rawlings.
During that meeting, Mr. Gilbert said that he had had discussions with Mr. Graber regarding Huffys interest in Rawlings. 

On June 21, 2002, Mr. Gilbert amended his Schedule 13D to report his ownership of 11.3% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

On June 21, 2002, Huffys financial advisor informed Rawlings financial advisor that Huffy would be unable to consider any transaction until Huffys acquisition of Gen-X Sports was
completed. Subsequently, on October 7, 2002, Huffys financial advisor informed Rawlings financial advisor that, due to the integration of Gen-X Sports, Huffy would not be able to consider any transaction with Rawlings until Huffys
fourth quarter was completed. 

On July 25, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met to discuss Mr. Gilberts
open market purchases of Rawlings stock reported in his Schedules 13D, as well as his discussions with Rawlings representatives. The board also discussed its concerns that if Mr. Gilbert sought a change in control transaction, it might
disadvantage minority stockholders. 

On August 1, 2002, Mr. Gilbert amended his Schedule 13D to report his
ownership of 13.4% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

On August 7, 2002, Mr. OHara, Mr.
Ryan and Mr. William C. Robinson, another Rawlings director, met with Mr. Gilbert prior to the Rawlings board of directors meeting on that same day. Mr. Gilbert reasserted his interest in becoming chairman of the board of Rawlings, making a
substantial investment in the company and making subsequent changes to the companys management and direction. 

During the August 7, 2002 board meeting, the directors reviewed the recent meeting with Mr. Gilbert and reaffirmed their lack of interest in his proposal. Among other reasons for its lack of interest, the Rawlings board noted that
Mr. Gilbert did not provide a definitive proposal for improving the companys financial performance, the dilutive effect from an increase in outstanding shares which would result if such a transaction were consummated, and the potential unequal
treatment of Rawlings stockholders. 

On August 19, 2002, Mr. Gilbert amended his Schedule 13D to report his
ownership of 14.6% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. 

Rawlings Contacts with Russell
Corporation from July, 2002 through October, 2002 

On July 9, 2002, Mr. OHara met with Mr. Jonathan
Letzler, President of Russell Corporation, at Mr. OHaras suggestion. Mr. OHara provided him with an overview of Rawlings and of Rawlings managements belief that the sporting goods industry will consolidate and
suggested that Russell and Rawlings explore some form of strategic arrangement. 

On August 2, 2002, Mr.
OHara met with and gave Mr. Jack Ward, Chief Executive Officer of Russell, a tour of Rawlings Washington, Missouri distribution facility and a presentation of the Rawlings business plan. Mr. OHara and Mr. Ward discussed
Russells possible interest in a strategic acquisition of Rawlings and the potential benefits thereof. 

THE MERGER



On August 13, 2002, Russell executed Rawlings standard form of
confidentiality agreement, including customary standstill provisions, and Rawlings provided information in response to Russells initial due diligence request. Mr. OHara also provided information to Russell in response to a subsequent
request on August 27, 2002. 

On September 17, 2002, Mr. OHara, Mr. William Lacey, Chief Financial Officer of
Rawlings, and Rawlings financial advisor met in Atlanta, Georgia with Russells senior management to address Russells questions and provide a detailed review of Rawlings business and operations. 

On September 25, 2002, Russell submitted to Rawlings a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest that included an offer to purchase
the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock at a price between $7.00 and $8.00 per share, with the consideration to be an undetermined mix of cash and Russell common stock. 

On September 26, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met with Rawlings financial and legal advisors to review and evaluate the terms of the Russell proposal and to
prepare a response to that proposal. Although the board did not agree to grant Russell an exclusive negotiating period as Russell had requested, it did authorize Mr. OHara to explore the possibility of increasing Russells offer.

On September 30, 2002, Mr. OHara met in Atlanta with Mr. Ward, Mr. Floyd Hoffman, Russells Senior
Vice President of Strategic Planning, and Mr. Robert Martin, Russells Chief Financial Officer, to respond in person to Russells offer. During that meeting, Mr. OHara expressed interest in an alliance with Russell but qualified such
interest with reference to Russells need to increase its offer. During the meeting, Mr. OHara and Mr. Ward discussed conducting further due diligence with a view towards Russell increasing its offer. 

On October 2, 2002, Mr. OHara and Mr. Ward had a telephone conference during which Mr. Ward requested a four week period of due
diligence that would give Russell access to Rawlings management personnel and facilities. Mr. OHara agreed to this request with the exception of excluding meetings with Rawlings personnel, other than Mr. OHara and Mr. Lacey,
in order to keep Rawlings employees focused on executing the operating plan without distraction. 

On October
15, 2002 through October 17, 2002, representatives of Russell, its outside auditors and outside legal counsel performed due diligence at the St. Louis offices of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP. Mr. Lacey and a representative of George K. Baum also
participated in meetings with representatives of Russell at that time. 

On October 25, 2002, Mr. OHara
received a call from Mr. Hoffman who indicated that, based on due diligence to date, Russell would only reaffirm its range of between $7.00 and $8.00 per share of Rawlings common stock and not improve it. Mr. Hoffman requested further due diligence
with respect to Rawlings intellectual property, sales and marketing and manufacturing facilities that would include access to members of Rawlings second-tier management. Mr. OHara granted Russell access to all facilities and
arranged operations discussions with third party apparel and IT consultants. Mr. OHara did not permit contact to be made with other Rawlings officers so as to limit the disruption to Rawlings operations. 

Rawlings Discussions With Other Parties 

In addition to the discussions described above, between March, 2002 and December, 2002, Rawlings had contacts with various other parties with respect to strategic
transactions that included both the possible sale of Rawlings as well as possible strategic acquisitions by Rawlings. Discussions with some of these parties evolved into initial diligence reviews, negotiations regarding a potential transaction and
conversations with potential financing sources relating to a particular strategic acquisition by Rawlings of certain assets of a sporting goods company. 

THE MERGER



Rawlings Shareholder Rights Plan 

Rawlings initially adopted a shareholder rights plan on July 1, 1994 in connection with the companys initial public offering. At
Rawlings annual meetings of stockholders on April 13, 2000 and May 15, 2001, in response to a precatory stockholder proposal on July 6, 1999 that requested the board of directors to redeem the shareholder rights plan, a majority of the shares
actually voting at the respective meetings voted in favor of redeeming the rights plan. The board subsequently redeemed the rights on December 31, 2001. 

At meetings on April 8, 2002 and August 7, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors discussed the need for and design of a new shareholder rights plan in light of Mr. Gilberts open market
acquisitions and stated intention, the inadequate price proposed by Huffy and the risk that Rawlings would be put into play without the board of directors having sufficient negotiating leverage or flexibility to pursue the best strategic
alternatives for Rawlings stockholders. The board also discussed the use of a new shareholder rights plan to prevent abusive takeover measures and the design of a new plan that would permit transactions structured to provide the equal
treatment of all stockholders. Based on its determination that further events would unfold before those threats materialized, the board concluded that a new rights plan was not necessary at that time. 

On November 27, 2002, the Rawlings board met to discuss K2s expression of interest, as discussed below, and the need to adopt a
shareholder rights plan to facilitate pursuit of the best strategic alternative available to Rawlings. Rawlings financial advisor and legal advisors reviewed the benefits of adopting such a plan, which would provide sufficient time, as well as
flexibility and negotiating leverage, to adequately evaluate strategic alternatives in an orderly manner and would facilitate obtaining enhanced value for all stockholders. The board unanimously approved the adoption of a new shareholder rights plan
that was designed to ensure equal treatment of stockholders and that contained a permitted offer exception under which a fully financed and fair offer to purchase all of the shares of the company would not be subject to the terms of the rights plan
and a provision that requires an independent committee of the board of directors to review the rights plan regularly to confirm that the plan continues to be in the best interests of Rawlings stockholders. 

Background of Rawlings Contacts and Negotiations with K2 and Competing Bidders 

On June 4, 2002, Mr. OHara and Rawlings financial advisor had an initial meeting with Mr. Richard Rodstein and Mr. John
Rangel, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice PresidentFinance, respectively, of K2, in order to discuss Rawlings strategic direction and recent operating results. During the meeting, Mr. Rodstein and Mr. Rangel expressed K2s
interest in expanding into team sports and discussed potential strategies for using Rawlings to assist K2 in reaching that market. 

On June 7, 2002, Rawlings financial advisor spoke with Mr. Rodstein regarding K2s interest in Rawlings. 

On October 2, 2002, the chief executive officer of a thinly traded public sporting goods company met with Mr. OHara and toured Rawlings distribution facility in Washington, Missouri. On
October 7, 2002, Mr. OHara and Mr. Lacey met with the senior management of that company in Chicago to discuss the companys potential acquisition of Rawlings. 

On October 11, 2002, K2 announced Mr. Rodsteins resignation as Chief Executive Officer and his replacement by Mr. Richard Heckmann. 

On October 14, 2002, Rawlings financial advisor contacted Mr. Heckmann regarding K2s interest in Rawlings. Mr. Heckmann
expressed an interest in a potential strategic transaction and indicated that K2 desired to operate on an expeditious timeframe in evaluating any potential transaction. K2s counsel subsequently requested, and Rawlings agreed to make, certain
changes to the standstill provisions included in Rawlings confidentiality agreement which would permit K2 to make an acquisition proposal to Rawlings board of directors and management as well as to terminate any other standstill
limitations if Rawlings board of directors approved a tender offer or business combination with a third party. 

THE MERGER



On October 29, 2002, representatives from George K. Baum provided Rawlings due
diligence information to The Mercanti Group, K2s financial advisor. Discussions regarding a potential transaction also occurred on the next day. 

Also, from October 29, 2002 through November 1, 2002, Mr. OHara and Rawlings financial advisor had multiple meetings with various parties regarding Rawlings potential acquisition of
certain assets of a sporting goods company. 

On October 30, 2002, Mr. OHara, Mr. Heckmann and the financial
advisor of each party spoke by telephone and discussed Rawlings operating plan as well as consolidation trends in the sporting goods industry. 

On October 30, 2002 and October 31, 2002, Rawlings financial advisors spoke to representatives of Merrill Lynch, Russells financial advisor, who confirmed that a range between $7.00
and $8.00 per share was still Russells value range based on the due diligence that Russell had performed. Russells advisor indicated that Russell understood that the range was inadequate, but that additional due diligence, which could be
completed quickly, would be aimed at identifying additional value to justify a potential increase in the offer. Rawlings financial advisors requested written clarification of Russells remaining due diligence. 

During the week of November 3, 2002, representatives of Russell conducted due diligence and management meetings at Rawlings
facilities in Licking and Washington, Missouri, Costa Rica, New York and Tennessee. 

Before the Rawlings
Board meeting on November 4, 2002, Rawlings financial advisors spoke with Russells financial advisors. Russells advisors indicated that a written statement of remaining due diligence, as requested by Rawlings financial
advisors, would not be forthcoming. Russells advisors indicated that Russell was making progress on its remaining due diligence, with the exception of gaining access to Rawlings second-tier management. 

On November 4, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met with its financial and legal advisors and reviewed the status of the discussions
with various parties with respect to a possible combination with Rawlings and Rawlings possible acquisition of a sporting goods company. The board discussed three primary alternatives: (1) effecting a business combination with a third party;
(2) enhancing internal growth through acquisitions such as the potential acquisition of certain assets of a sporting goods company and (3) remaining independent and pursuing internal growth through implementation of the companys current
operating plan. The financial advisors presented information on each of the transaction candidates and the board discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each. The board authorized Mr. OHara to submit a preliminary offer to acquire
certain assets of a sporting goods company, which the board determined would not be inconsistent with pursuing other alternatives. 

Later on November 4, 2002, Mr. OHara and Rawlings financial advisors conducted a conference call with K2s senior management and financial advisors. K2 indicated a preliminary range of interest for Rawlings
between $8.00 and $9.00 per share in a transaction that would be structured as a stock-for-stock merger. Mr. OHara expressed disappointment in this value range, but stated that he was willing to allow additional due diligence with an
understanding that the value must be higher. 

On November 5, 2002, Russells representative contacted Mr.
OHara to discuss several due diligence issues. 

On November 7, 2002, Rawlings submitted a preliminary
non-binding letter of intent for the potential acquisition of certain assets of a sporting goods company. 

On
November 7, 2002 and November 8, 2002, representatives from The Mercanti Group and representatives from K2s professional advisors performed initial financial due diligence on behalf of K2 with respect to Rawlings at the St. Louis offices of
Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP. Mr. OHara, Mr. Lacey and representatives of George K. Baum also took part in these due diligence meetings. 

THE MERGER



On November 8, 2002, the financial advisor of a thinly traded public sporting
goods company that had expressed interest in Rawlings and had conducted limited due diligence submitted a preliminary proposal to Rawlings financial advisor. The proposal was based on a stock merger in which a fixed number of shares would be
issued at closing and additional shares would be issued contingent on Rawlings fiscal 2003 financial results. Mr. OHara and Rawlings board of directors were informed of the proposal, but did not consider the proposal further due to its
contingent structure. 

On November 13, 2002 and November 14, 2002, Mr. Heckmann, Mr. Rangel, and representatives
from The Mercanti Group performed additional business and financial due diligence on behalf of K2 in St. Louis with Mr. OHara, Mr. Lacey and representatives from George K. Baum. At the conclusion thereof, Mr. Heckmann reaffirmed K2s
interest in a business combination with Rawlings and suggested a preliminary valuation of Rawlings at $9.00 per share. 

On November 18, 2002, Mr. OHara received a call from Mr. Hoffman reaffirming Russells offer range of $7.00 to $8.00 with a focus on the midpoint of that range. Mr. Hoffman indicated that Russell could complete due
diligence and prepare a definitive agreement within two weeks. Mr. OHara informed Mr. Hoffman that the offer range was not attractive to Rawlings. 

On November 20, 2002 and November 21, 2002, representatives of George K. Baum spoke to representatives of Merrill Lynch who reaffirmed Russells range between $7.00 and $8.00 per share with a
focus on the midpoint of that range and stated that, based on the valuation methodologies employed by Russell, they did not anticipate a higher offer. They also stated that the Russell management team met on November 21, 2002 and decided not to
submit a written offer, but confirmed that representatives of George K. Baum could present the $7.00 to $8.00 range with a midpoint focus for consideration by the Rawlings board of directors at its upcoming meeting on November 22, 2002. The form of
consideration of the offer was not provided other than that it would be a mixture of cash and Russell common stock. 

Also, on November 20, 2002, representatives from George K. Baum performed due diligence on portions of K2s strategic plan, which had been presented by K2 management to the K2 board on October 4, 2002. 

On November 21, 2002, K2 submitted a written indication of interest that provided for a stock-for-stock merger valuing Rawlings common
stock at $9.00 per share. In its indication of interest, K2 requested exclusivity through December 23, 2002 to complete due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement. 

On November 22, 2002, the K2 board of directors met to evaluate the potential combination with Rawlings. K2s management and financial advisors discussed with the K2
board the advantages and disadvantages of the potential combination with Rawlings. K2s management and financial advisors also discussed with the K2 board different valuation ranges that would make the potential combination attractive to K2.

Also on November 22, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met to evaluate K2s and Russells
proposals. Representatives of George K. Baum delivered a presentation on K2 and Russell common stock and a comparison of an all stock transaction with K2 and a cash and stock transaction with Russell. The directors authorized Mr. OHara to
continue negotiations with K2, but refused to grant K2 an exclusive negotiating period. In addition, the board instructed Mr. OHara to inform Russell that its latest offer was not compelling. The board also discussed other alternatives to
achieving greater value, including continuing to operate the companys business as an independent entity and the possibility of an acquisition proposal from Mr. Gilbert. After the meeting Mr. OHara called Mr. Hoffman to inform him
that Rawlings board viewed Russells offer as inadequate. Mr. OHara and Mr. Hoffman discussed the possibility of Russells continued interest at a later date. 

Between November 22, 2002 and November 29, 2002, K2 and Rawlings management and their financial advisor began negotiating the proposed terms of the merger agreement,
including the exchange ratio. 

THE MERGER



From November 23, 2002 through December 15, 2002, Mr. Heckmann provided
information relating to the proposed Rawlings transaction to members of the K2 board and he held various informal meetings and with members of the K2 board to discuss the material terms of the potential acquisition and the state of the negotiations
with Rawlings. 

On November 25, 2002, Rawlings financial advisor spoke to Russells financial advisor
and indicated that Russells current offer was inadequate. Russells advisors stated that Russell continued to be interested in a potential transaction, but could not justify a higher valuation at that time. Russells advisors also
indicated that a transaction in mid 2003 might be more optimal as it permitted further evidence of Rawlings improved financial performance. Rawlings advisors informed Russells advisors that other circumstances may dictate that Rawlings pursue
other strategic options before that time. 

On November 27, 2002, the Rawlings board of directors met with the
companys financial and legal advisors. The financial advisors presented information concerning K2 and Rawlings and the terms of the proposed offer as well as information on the use of collars in stock-for-stock transactions. Following a
detailed discussion, the directors authorized Mr. OHara to further negotiate terms for a transaction with K2 based upon a 0.90 exchange ratio. 

Also on November 27, 2002, Rawlings publicly announced that it was evaluating an expression of interest from a strategic party for the potential acquisition of Rawlings. 

On November 29, 2002, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, outside legal counsel to K2, presented Rawlings with a first draft of the merger
agreement. The draft included a fixed exchange ratio such that, upon completion of the merger, each share of Rawlings common stock would be converted into 0.90 of a share of K2 common stock. 

On December 3, 2002, Mr. Gilbert submitted a proposal indicating an interest in acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock at a price of $8.00 per
share in cash. Mr. Gilbert also suggested the possibility of a higher offer after due diligence. Mr. OHara responded to Mr. Gilbert by requesting that Mr. Gilbert execute Rawlings standard confidentiality agreement to permit him to
conduct due diligence. Mr. Gilbert objected to the standstill provisions included in Rawlings confidentiality agreement and, based on the protections provided by the newly adopted shareholder rights plan, Rawlings agreed to remove the
standstill provisions. 

Also on December 3, 2002, Mr. OHara spoke to Mr. Hoffman and asserted the need for a
higher range if Russells bid was to be considered competitive. 

On December 4, 2002 and December 5, 2002,
representatives from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP performed legal due diligence with respect to Rawlings at the offices of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP in St. Louis. 

From December 5, 2002 through December 11, 2002, K2s operations managers toured Rawlings major facilities to evaluate Rawlings operations and to analyze
potential synergies and cost savings that could be realized by the combined business. During this period, K2s operations managers toured Rawlings: distribution facility in Washington, Missouri; corporate headquarters in Fenton, Missouri;
wood bat factory in Dolgeville, New York; tanning facility in Tullahoma, Tennessee; and manufacturing facility in Costa Rica. 

On December 6, 2002, Rawlings personnel and financial advisor conducted due diligence and interviews with the sporting goods company to which Rawlings had previously submitted an indication of interest. 

On December 10, 2002, representatives from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP held a telephone conference to
further negotiate the terms of the potential merger agreement between K2

THE MERGER



and Rawlings. On that same day, Mr. OHara, Mr. Lacey, Mr. Mickey Bell, an employee of Rawlings, and representatives from George K. Baum and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP performed additional
due diligence with respect to K2s overall business at K2s Shakespeare facility in Columbia, South Carolina. 

From December 10, 2002 through December 14, 2002, representatives of KPMG LLP, Rawlings outside auditors, conducted financial due diligence on K2 in Los Angeles. 

On December 11, 2002 and December 12, 2002, Mr. Rangel, representatives from The Mercanti Group and K2s professional advisors performed additional due diligence on
Rawlings, and Mr. OHara, Mr. Lacey and representatives of George K. Baum performed additional due diligence on K2. 

On December 11, 2002 K2 issued a press release confirming that it was the strategic party that had expressed an interest in a combination with Rawlings. 

On December 11, 2002, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP distributed to Rawlings a revised draft of the merger agreement. 

On December 11, 2002 and December 12, 2002, Mr. Gilbert and representatives of Mr. Gilberts financial advisor, legal counsel and private investment firm
conducted due diligence and participated in management meetings at the offices of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP in St. Louis. The same parties also received a facility tour of Rawlings Washington, Missouri distribution center. Because Rawlings
was informed that K2 may withdraw its offer if not acted upon in the very near future, Rawlings financial advisors told Mr. Gilbert and his advisors that he would need to present his best offer by Monday, December 16, 2002, and maybe sooner if
circumstances so dictated. Mr. Gilbert declined to remain in St. Louis until December 13, 2002 when additional Rawlings management would be available for conferences. 

From December 11, 2002 through December 15, 2002, K2s and Rawlings legal advisors negotiated the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The provisions
negotiated included a termination fee payable by Rawlings to K2 under specified circumstances in an amount equal to 4% of the equity value of the transaction plus all of K2s fees and expenses incurred in negotiating the transaction, including
investment banking and legal fees. Rawlings estimated that the termination fee and expenses together would total approximately 6-7% of the equity value of the transaction. The parties eventually agreed on a termination fee totaling approximately
3.5% of the equity value of the transaction with no provisions regarding the payment of fees and expenses. 

On
December 11, 2002, Russells financial advisor contacted representatives of George K. Baum and expressed Russells interest in a transaction valued at $8.00 per share with consideration of 50% cash and 50% stock, subject to further due
diligence. After conferring with Mr. OHara, Rawlings financial advisors indicated that Russell would need to improve its offer and respond with definitive terms by Monday, December 16, 2002, and possibly sooner if circumstances so
dictated. Russell was also granted full access to Rawlings personnel and facilities to complete its due diligence from December 13, 2002 through December 15, 2002 but Russell refused to take full advantage of this opportunity stating that it
would need at least one additional week to complete its due diligence. Russells advisors requested that Russell be released from the standstill provisions contained in its confidentiality agreement with Rawlings. After consultation with
Rawlings management and legal counsel, Rawlings financial advisor informed Merrill Lynch that Rawlings would not release Russell from the standstill provisions. Rawlings legal counsel had a similar discussion with Russells
legal counsel. Rawlings took this position because, among other things, it would ensure the receipt of a best and final offer from Russell, Mr. Gilbert and other potential bidders without potential collusion between them and would enable
Rawlings to control the process by which it would determine and pursue the best strategic alternative for the benefit of Rawlings stockholders. 

On December 13, 2002, representatives of Russell conducted due diligence conference calls with Rawlings financial and sales and marketing personnel. Also on December 13, 2002, Mr. OHara
advised Mr. Heckmann that K2s offer needed to be improved given the competitive process. Later that day, Mr. Heckmann called Mr. OHara to give notice that the K2 offer would expire at midnight on December 16, 2002. As a result,
Rawlings management determined that it must accelerate the receipt of best and final offers from the other

THE MERGER



interested parties and hold a board meeting late Sunday afternoon, December 15, 2002. Rawlings financial advisor contacted Russells and Mr. Gilberts financial advisors to inform
them that their best and final offers must be received by noon on Sunday, December 15, 2002. Requests were made of Bull Run in two previous letters to submit an acquisition proposal and, since it had not responded with a proposal, there was no
perceived need to make further inquiry. 

On December 14, 2002, representatives from Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP
performed legal due diligence on K2 at the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in Los Angeles and representatives from George K. Baum continued their due diligence of K2 via conference calls to K2s management and financial advisors.

As of December 14, 2002, negotiations were complete with respect to substantially all of the terms of the merger
agreement with K2 other than the exchange ratio. 

On December 15, 2002, Mr. Gilbert delivered a letter to Rawlings
increasing his proposed offer to acquire Rawlings to $8.50 in cash per share for Rawlings common stock. Mr. Gilberts proposal reflected an all-cash tender offer that was subject to the following conditions: negotiation and execution of a
definitive merger agreement containing customary terms and conditions, the continued effectiveness of Rawlings agreement with Major League Baseball, the continuation of Rawlings current credit facility following the transaction, and the
removal of Rawlings shareholder rights plan. In addition, Mr. Gilberts letter anticipated a termination fee equal to 3% of the overall transaction value. In the letter, Mr. Gilbert also expressed his views regarding what he believed to
be the speculative nature of K2s common stock. 

Russell also delivered a letter to Rawlings on December 15,
2002, increasing its offer to acquire Rawlings to $8.50 per share for Rawlings common stock with consideration of 50% cash and 50% Russell common stock. Russells offer was conditioned upon due diligence at the second-tier management level and
finalizing remaining due diligence. Russell indicated that these conditions along with its inability to discuss the transactions with Rawlings two major stockholders precluded Russell from putting forth its best offer, and that, based on the
outcome of final due diligence and stockholder discussions, Russell may be able to increase its offer. Russell indicated that it could complete its remaining due diligence by December 20, 2002 and submit a form of definitive agreement on such date,
with completion of negotiations of an agreement within seven days. 

Also on December 15, 2002, Mr. Heckmann
contacted Mr. OHara and indicated that K2 planned to modify the terms of the exchange ratio and include a collar mechanism. Later on December 15, 2002, the management, legal and financial advisors of K2 and Rawlings met by telephone conference
to negotiate the exchange ratio, but without Rawlings disclosing the terms of Mr. Gilberts or Russells offer. 

Based on several factors Rawlings considered, including the historical volatility of K2 common stock and the amount of Mr. Gilberts all cash offer, Rawlings management favored a collar mechanism because it would protect
Rawlings stockholders from any substantial decrease in the market price of K2s common stock prior to the completion of the merger. 

After additional discussions with Rawlings management and the respective financial and legal advisors later on December 15, 2002, K2 proposed a collar structure which was negotiated and refined
on that same date. The K2 proposal, which K2 indicated was its final offer, provided for an exchange ratio that would be initially fixed at 0.950, but would otherwise move according to the average daily closing price per share of K2 common stock for
the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the closing date. Specifically, if the average daily closing price (1) was less than $9.47, the exchange ratio would be calculated by dividing $9.00 by the
average daily closing price of K2 common stock during such ten day period, or (2) was greater than $10.53, the exchange ratio would be calculated by dividing $10.00 by the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during such ten day period. If
the average daily closing price was between $9.47 and $10.53, the exchange ratio would remain fixed at 0.950. K2s proposal also gave K2 the right to terminate the agreement if the average closing price of K2s common stock decreased below
$8.00 for any ten consecutive trading days prior to closing. 

THE MERGER



During the late afternoon and evening of December 15, 2002, Rawlings board
of directors met with Rawlings management and legal and financial advisors to discuss the offers received from Mr. Gilbert and Russell, the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement with K2, including the exchange ratio, and
Rawlings other strategic alternatives. Representatives of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP then discussed the boards fiduciary duties in considering a business combination and discussed in detail the terms of the proposed merger agreement
with K2. 

Because Mr. Gilbert had not clearly indicated that he had put forth his best and final proposal and
Russell had expressed a possible willingness to increase its offer the board instructed the companys financial and legal advisors to contact the representatives of Mr. Gilbert and Russell to confirm that the offers received earlier in the day
were in fact their best and final offers but without disclosing the terms of the K2 offer. Mr. Gilbert and the advisors to Russell verified that Rawlings had received the parties best offers and in the case of Russell that it was removing its
due diligence condition with respect to its offer at $8.50 per share. Russells legal counsel also indicated that Russell might make a higher offer after it completed all of its remaining due diligence. The Rawlings board of directors
nevertheless was skeptical that Russell would increase its offer after further due diligence because (i) Russell had already conducted extensive due diligence on Rawlings which was more than any other bidder, (ii) Russell had been unwilling to take
advantage of the additional three days made available to Russell to complete its due diligence immediately prior to the time bidding was finalized, and (iii) in prior negotiations and discussions, Russell indicated a reluctance to increase its bid.

As part of the boards consideration, George K. Baum rendered its opinion to Rawlings board of
directors, stating that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations listed in its opinion, from a financial point of view, the merger consideration in the K2 offer was fair to Rawlings common
stockholders. After considerable analysis and discussion, the board determined that the K2 proposal was the best strategic alternative reasonably available to Rawlings for the reasons set forth under Rawlings Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Rawlings Board on page 45. 

Following careful deliberation of the offers received from
Mr. Gilbert and Russell as well as the proposed merger agreement with K2, and after discussion with its financial and legal advisers, the Rawlings directors voting on the proposal unanimously determined to accept K2s offer and
unanimously approved the merger agreement, subject to increasing the length of the measuring period for the collar mechanism from ten to fifteen trading days. Upon advice of Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP, Mr. OHara abstained from the voting
because of Mr. OHaras potential employment with the combined company following the merger. 

After the
Rawlings board of directors approved the merger agreement, K2s board of directors convened in person and by telephone conference with K2s management and legal and financial advisers. The participants discussed the terms and
conditions of the proposed merger agreement, including the exchange ratio. Representatives of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP summarized for the K2 board the material terms of the merger agreement that had been negotiated by the parties.
Representatives of The Mercanti Group participated in the meeting and provided advice with respect to the financial aspects of the transaction. Following careful consideration of the proposed merger agreement and further discussion of the benefits
and risks of the proposed transaction, the members of K2s board of directors in attendance unanimously determined that the terms and provisions of the merger agreement, including the change to the measuring period for the collar mechanism
requested by the Rawlings board of directors, were in the best interests of K2s stockholders, and the K2 board approved the issuance of shares in connection with the merger. Thereafter, K2 and Rawlings executed the merger agreement.

On December 16, 2002, K2 and Rawlings issued press releases announcing the transaction and outlining the details
and terms of the proposed merger. 

THE MERGER



K2s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the K2 Board 

K2s board of
directors believes that the merger represents an opportunity to enhance value for K2 stockholders. The decision of K2s board of directors to enter into the merger agreement and to recommend that K2 stockholders approve the issuance of the
shares of K2 common stock to be issued in the merger were the result of careful consideration by the board of directors of numerous factors. Significant factors considered by the K2 board of directors include, among others: 



Strategic Growth Through Acquisition
.    The consolidation of sporting goods retailers worldwide is leading to a consolidation of
sporting goods suppliers. K2 believes that the most successful sporting goods suppliers will be those with greater financial resources and a broader selection of products and brands. The merger with Rawlings furthers K2s strategy of expanding
its operations, diversifying its product offerings and adding strong brands through combinations with well-established companies. 



Key Platform For Growth.
    One key market segment into which K2 plans to expand is the team sports segment. Because of its strong
product lines, expertise in the category and brand name recognition, Rawlings represents a premier platform for K2s entry into the team sports segment. 



Increased Market Presence and Opportunities.
    As the sporting goods industry undergoes consolidation, the large sporting goods
retailers prefer to rely on fewer and larger sporting goods suppliers to help them manage the supply of products and the allocation of shelf space. The combination of K2s and Rawlings leading brands and product offerings will provide K2
with a broader product offering and an increased market presence that will help K2 address the needs of the large sporting goods retailers. 



Operating Synergies.
    The combination of K2 and Rawlings will create synergies by providing opportunities to leverage the
companies strengths in distribution, manufacturing, administration, product development and marketing. 



Enhanced Management Team.
    K2 and Rawlings each enjoy top quality management teams that understand their respective market
segments. The combination of Rawlings and K2 creates an enhanced management team by combining the strengths and experience of both companies management teams. 



Reduced Seasonality and Exposure to Weather
.    K2s business lines are seasonal in nature. K2s results of operations are
typically impacted by the amount of snowfall during the winter months, which drives the sale of skis and snowboards. The addition of Rawlings businesses, which focus on spring and summer sports, will reduce K2s relative exposure to the
impact of snowfall in the winter months. Overall, the broader range of sporting goods products of the combined company will counter balance the seasonal nature of K2s and Rawlings product lines. 



Greater Liquidity
.    As a result of the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger, there will be a larger public float and
greater liquidity with respect to K2s common stock following the merger. 

The foregoing
discussion of factors considered by K2s board is not meant to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the K2 board in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and in
recommending that stockholders vote their K2 shares in favor of the issuance of shares in the merger. The K2 board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination. Rather, the board made their respective determination based on the totality of the information presented to them, and the judgments of individual members of the board may have been influenced to a greater or lesser degree
by different factors. 

Recommendation of the K2 Board of Directors
.    After careful
consideration of these and other factors, as well as the risks described under Risk Factors on page 20, the K2 board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of K2, and recommends that the stockholders of K2 vote 
FOR
 the issuance of shares of K2 common stock in the merger. All of the K2 directors who considered the merger
agreement concur in the foregoing determination and recommendation. 

THE MERGER



Rawlings Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Rawlings Board 

The
Rawlings board of directors believes that the merger is advisable, fair to and in the best interest of, Rawlings and the Rawlings stockholders. Accordingly, at the special meeting of the Rawlings board of directors held on December 15, 2002 at which
the merger was considered and voted upon, the Rawlings directors voting on the matter unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger. Upon advice of legal counsel, Mr. OHara abstained from the voting because of Mr.
OHaras potential employment with the combined company following the merger. The directors voting on the matter unanimously recommend that the holders of shares of Rawlings common stock vote 
FOR
 the adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the merger. 

In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, the Rawlings board of directors consulted with Rawlings management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and considered the following material factors: 



the premium represented by the per share merger consideration offered by K2 in comparison to other offers and expressions of interest received by Rawlings prior
to the execution of the merger agreement, as more fully discussed under Background of the Merger on page 33; 



the structure of the K2 offer, including a collar provision that assures that the value of K2 stock to be received by Rawlings stockholders at the
effective time of the merger will be between $9.00 and $10.00 per share. The high end of this range would represent a potential $1.50 per share premium over the next highest offer received by Rawlings prior to the execution of the merger agreement;



the exchange ratio of 0.950 shares of K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings common stock, subject to the collar provision discussed above, represented
merger consideration of $9.38 per share as of the date of the merger agreement. In addition, it also represented a substantial premium over historical and market trading prices for Rawlings common stock. Specifically, it represented a premium of
approximately 48% when compared to the closing price for Rawlings common stock on November 26, 2002, the day prior to the initial announcement of a potential transaction, and a premium of approximately 49%, 61%, 66% and 69% when compared to the
average closing price of Rawlings common stock for the thirty, sixty, ninety and one hundred eighty day periods, respectively, prior to the execution of the merger agreement; 



the evaluation by the Rawlings board of directors of various strategic alternatives, including but not limited to, remaining an independent company and pursuing
either solely internal growth or internal growth combined with external growth through acquisition of other companies or businesses within Rawlings industry; 



the terms of the merger agreement, including that the merger agreement (1) permits Rawlings to provide information and enter into negotiations with a third
party that submits an unsolicited transaction proposal to Rawlings, if the board of directors determines in good faith, upon consultation with legal counsel, that (a) failure to do so is reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties, (b) there is a reasonable likelihood that such proposal could result in a proposal that is more favorable to Rawlings stockholders and, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other issues, (c) Rawlings provides prior written notice to K2 and (d) Rawlings obtains a confidentiality agreement from the third party in customary form; and (2) permits the Rawlings board of directors to change its
recommendation to its stockholders or recommend or enter into an agreement with a third party that is more favorable to Rawlings stockholders if (a) the board of directors determines in good faith, upon consultation with legal counsel, that
the failure to do so is reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties, (b) the board of directors determines, in good faith, that the third party proposal is more favorable to Rawlings stockholders from a financial
point of view and is reasonably capable of consummation, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other issues, (c) Rawlings provides written notice to K2, setting forth the terms of the third party proposal and K2 does not make

THE MERGER



an offer to Rawlings within three business days that the Rawlings board of directors determines in good faith, to be at least as favorable to the Rawlings stockholders as the third party proposal
and (d) Rawlings pays to K2 a termination fee of $2,900,000; 



the opinion of George K. Baum & Company provided to the Rawlings board of directors on December 15, 2002, that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair to the holders of Rawlings common stock, from a financial point of view, see Opinion of Rawlings Financial Advisor on page 48;



the likelihood that other offers or expressions of interest at prices higher than the merger consideration would reasonably be expected to have surfaced prior
to the execution of the merger agreement and following the November 27, 2002 announcement by Rawlings that it had received an expression of interest in acquiring the company; 



the ability of the Rawlings stockholders to vote against the merger and the merger agreement at the special meeting of stockholders without triggering the
payment of any termination fee; however, if at the time of Rawlings stockholder meeting a third party has publicly announced or Rawlings board had under consideration a proposal to acquire Rawlings, and Rawlings enters into an agreement within
twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement with any party with whom Rawlings had negotiations or who had submitted a proposal or expressed an interest in acquiring Rawlings, then Rawlings would be required to pay K2 a termination fee
of $2,900,000; 



the structure of the transaction as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, which will permit the Rawlings stockholders to
defer payment of capital gains taxes until they sell the shares of K2 common stock received in the merger, as discussed under Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations on page 53; 



the greater liquidity of K2s common stock following the merger as compared to Rawlings common stock; 



the fact that since Rawlings stockholders will hold approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of K2 following the merger, Rawlings
stockholders would have the opportunity to participate in the growth and opportunities of the combined company; 



the greater financial resources of the combined company that should allow management to develop products and implement marketing strategies more quickly than
Rawlings would likely be able to achieve as an independent company; 



the fact that the broader range of sporting goods products offered by the combined company will provide greater opportunity to strengthen existing customer
relationships, as well as counter balance the seasonal nature of Rawlings products; 



the fact that the combined companys experience, resources and breadth of product offerings may allow the combined company to better compete with larger
competitors that have begun to enter Rawlings core products markets and have greater financial and other resources than Rawlings; and 



the fact that the transaction is expected to achieve synergies, cost savings and economies of scale resulting from the combined marketing, sales and
administrative areas of the two companies following the merger, and which are expected to further the combined companys ability to achieve its financial goals. 

In the course of its deliberations, the Rawlings board of directors considered a number of additional factors relevant to the merger, including: 



the consideration of Rawlings strategic plan as an independent company, the restraints on Rawlings ability to pursue its strategic plans due to its
present size and limited financial resources and the belief that the merger would enhance Rawlings ability to pursue its plan; 

THE MERGER





Rawlings managements belief in the importance of consolidation within the sporting goods industry including consolidation of the team sports segment of
that industry; 



Rawlings managements view of the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Rawlings and K2 before and after giving effect to the
merger; 



current financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to the common stock of Rawlings, K2 and
Russell Corporation; 



the relationship between the market value of Rawlings common stock and the consideration to be received by Rawlings stockholders in the merger, and a comparison
to comparable merger transactions; 



the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties representations, warranties, covenants and conditions to their respective
obligations are reasonable for a transaction of this nature; 



the potential for other third parties to enter into strategic relationships with or to acquire Rawlings; 



the financial analyses and other information presented by George K. Baum & Company, Rawlings financial advisor; 



the information presented by Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP, Rawlings legal counsel, regarding the Rawlings board of directors fiduciary duties, the merger
agreement, the negotiations with K2 and other third parties expressing an interest in acquiring Rawlings and other related legal matters; and 



the fact that senior Rawlings management will have significant responsibilities within the combined company, which should facilitate the integration of Rawlings
into the combined company. 

The potential negative factors the Rawlings board of directors
considered include: 



the possibility the merger might not be consummated and the effect of public announcement of the merger on Rawlings sales, operating results, stock price
and employee retention; 



the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully realized; 



the risk that, notwithstanding the long-term benefits of the merger, the combined companys financial results and stock price might decline after the
merger when the collar mechanisms protections no longer apply; 



the possibility of substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses
arising from the merger; 



the risk that the companies might not be able to obtain the necessary approvals required to complete the merger, including approvals of both K2 and Rawlings
stockholders; 



other risks the merger and K2s and Rawlings businesses are subject to, as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
Risk Factors on page 20 and in each companys reports filed with the SEC; 



risks associated with fluctuations in K2s stock price prior to closing the merger; 



the factors identified by Russell Corporation, Mr. Gilbert and their respective advisors during the negotiations concerning their interest in acquiring Rawlings
and in their respective written proposals to acquire Rawlings; 



the fact that the acquisition consideration in Mr. Gilberts proposal to acquire Rawlings for $8.50 per share was cash, which would have enabled
Rawlings stockholders to avoid future market risk from holding K2 common stock, although that form of consideration also would prevent Rawlings stockholders from enjoying the upside potential of the combined company; 



Russell Corporations proposal to acquire Rawlings for $8.50 per share with half of the acquisition consideration in cash and the remaining half in Russell
common stock, which has historically

THE MERGER



experienced lower volatility and higher liquidity than K2 common stock, and the fact that Russell Corporation has greater financial resources than K2; 



Russell Corporations indication that it might be willing to offer more than $8.50 per share after completion of its due diligence, which was viewed
skeptically by Rawlings board due to (1) the extensive due diligence previously conducted by Russell, (2) Russells unwillingness to take advantage of the three days made available to Russell to complete its due diligence immediately
prior to execution of the merger agreement with K2 and (3) the prior negotiating history with Russell; and 



various other risks. 

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Rawlings board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the board in approving the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and in recommending that stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement. The Rawlings board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination. Rather, the board made their respective determination based on the totality of the information presented to them, and the judgments of individual members of the board may have been
influenced to a greater or lesser degree by different factors. 

In approving the merger agreement, the Rawlings
board of directors was aware of the interests of Rawlings management in the merger, as described in the section entitled Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger. 

Opinion of Rawlings Financial Advisor 

On December 15, 2002, George K. Baum &
Company delivered certain of its written analyses and its oral opinion to the Board of Directors of Rawlings, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, subject to the assumptions, procedures, and limitations set forth therein,
as of such date, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Rawlings common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of common stock.

The full text of the written opinion of George K. Baum, dated December 15, 2002, which sets forth assumptions
made, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B and is incorporated herein by reference. Holders of Rawlings common stock are urged
to, and should, read carefully the opinion in its entirety in conjunction with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The analysis and opinion of George K. Baum were prepared for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of Rawlings
in connection with its deliberations regarding the merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Rawlings common stock should vote with respect to the merger. 

In connection with its opinion, George K. Baum reviewed, among other things, the terms and conditions describing or otherwise directly
relating to the merger consideration set forth in the merger agreement; certain publicly available business and historical financial information relating to Rawlings and K2, including, without limitation, Annual Reports, Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and
other filings with the SEC; current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Rawlings common stock and K2 common stock; certain internal financial information and other data relating to the businesses and financial prospects of Rawlings
and K2, as well as estimates, financial forecasts and analyses prepared by the respective management teams of Rawlings and K2 that are not publicly available; and the process and background that led to the merger. In addition, George K. Baum held
discussions with members of the senior management of Rawlings and K2 regarding the business operations, prospects, and financial condition of Rawlings and K2, respectively. George K. Baum also reviewed publicly available financial and stock market
data with respect to certain companies that George K. Baum believed to be comparable in certain respects to Rawlings and K2; financial terms of certain business combinations that George K. Baum deemed to be comparable in certain respects to the
merger; certain historical

THE MERGER



data relating to premiums paid in mergers and acquisitions of publicly traded companies of a similar size to Rawlings; and conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and
considered such other information that George K. Baum deemed necessary or appropriate. 

In preparing its opinion,
George K. Baum relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information that was publicly available or provided to George K. Baum by or on behalf of Rawlings or K2, and was not engaged to verify any such
information. George K. Baum did not undertake nor obtain any independent evaluations or appraisals of any of the assets, properties or liabilities of Rawlings or K2, nor make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Rawlings or K2 for
such purposes. George K. Baum has not been engaged to independently verify any legal or accounting matters relative to the merger agreement. George K. Baum has assumed the merger will be validly consummated in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement. George K. Baum has also assumed, but has not determined, that the merger will qualify as a tax-deferred reorganization for federal income tax purposes. 

The opinion of George K. Baum addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Rawlings common stock and did not
address any other aspect of the merger. George K. Baum was not asked to, nor did it, express an opinion as to the effect of any other transaction in which Rawlings might engage or the underlying business decision of the Rawlings board of directors
to proceed with the merger. George K. Baum was not asked to, nor did it, express an opinion as to the actual value of K2 common stock when issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which K2 common stock will trade at any time. 

The opinion of George K. Baum necessarily is based on the information made available to George K. Baum and the conditions and
circumstances as they existed on December 15, 2002, and can be evaluated only as of such date. Events occurring after the date of the opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the opinion. 

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand George K.
Baums financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of George K. Baums financial analyses. The following
is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by George K. Baum and reported to the Board of Directors of Rawlings and is qualified in its entirety to reference to the full text of George K. Baums opinion. 

Comparable Company Analysis
.    George K. Baum noted that no company utilized in the comparable company
analysis is directly comparable to Rawlings or K2. Accordingly, it is George K. Baums view that an analysis of the following results necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the value of Rawlings common stock, K2 common stock or other publicly traded companies that George K. Baum deemed comparable in certain respects to Rawlings or K2. 

George K. Baum analyzed selected financial and operating data of Rawlings, K2 and the following nine publicly traded companies:
Amer Group plc, Brass Eagle Incorporated, Callaway Golf Company, Escalade, Inc., Head N.V., The Hockey Company, Huffy Corporation, Johnson Outdoors Inc. and Russell Corporation which are referred to herein as the comparable companies. George K. Baum
selected the comparable companies based on the size of such companies and their participation in certain segments of the sporting goods equipment industry. Though similar in certain respects, there are significant differences between the comparable
companies, Rawlings and K2. It is George K. Baums belief that due to the differences in financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies, the comparable company analysis is not readily susceptible to summary description.

THE MERGER



George K. Baum examined certain publicly available financial and stock market
trading data for the comparable companies to evaluate the implied trading multiples of enterprise value (equity value plus total net debt, preferred stock and minority interest) to (1) revenue, (2) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) and (3) earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), each for the latest 12 months (LTM). Likewise, George K. Baum also evaluated the implied trading multiples of equity value to (1) net income
(earnings per share with a multiple expressed as a P/E, or share price/earnings per share) and (2) tangible book value (book value of stockholders equity minus goodwill and other intangible assets) for the comparable
companies. For purposes of computing valuation multiples for Rawlings implied by the merger, George K. Baum used merger consideration of $9.00 per share based upon the limit established by the exchange ratio in the merger agreement. The LTM
financial data for Rawlings was based on publicly reported financial results for the period ended August 31, 2002. The LTM financial data for K2 was based on publicly reported financial results for the period ended September 30, 2002, as adjusted to
exclude the certain restructuring charges. This analysis indicated the following trading multiples for the comparable companies and K2 as compared to the multiples implied for Rawlings by the merger consideration:

Comparable Transaction
Analysis
.    George K. Baum noted that no merger or acquisition transaction utilized in the comparable transaction analysis is identical to the merger. Accordingly, George K. Baum believed that an analysis of the following
results necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial, operating and other characteristics of Rawlings and the companies involved in the comparable transactions. 

George K. Baum identified and performed an analysis of 15 merger and acquisition transactions that occurred since 1997 in the sporting
goods equipment industry. The transactions analyzed included the following:

Discounted Cash Flow

Analysis.
    George K. Baum performed an analysis of the present value of Rawlings projected future free cash flows. This analysis assumed that Rawlings continued as a going concern, remained independent and pursued
its current business plan. Rawlings management prepared financial projections based on detailed operating assumptions and estimates of market conditions for the fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005. In assessing the range of likely outcomes
related to Rawlings future performance, the Rawlings board of directors considered managements projections along with sensitivity cases where 85% and 70% of projected EBITDA for such years was achieved. 

For purposes of this analysis, George K. Baum calculated a terminal value for free cash flows beyond the forecast period by applying
terminal multiples to Rawlings projected fiscal year 2005 EBITDA ranging from 5.0x to 6.0x. Based on George K. Baums estimate of Rawlings weighted average cost of capital, the free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to
the present using a range of discount rates from 10.0% to 14.0%. Based on these assumptions, George K. Baums analysis indicated the following values per share for Rawlings common stock as compared to the merger consideration of $9.00 per share
based upon the limit established by the exchange ratio in the merger agreement:

Historical Stock Price
Analysis.
    George K. Baum analyzed Rawlings historical stock prices on a volume-weighted basis over various periods of time rather than the historical prices of Rawlings common stock on any particular trading day.
George K. Baum performed its analysis of the merger consideration compared to volume-weighted average stock prices of Rawlings common stock over various periods ending on November 27, 2002, the day Rawlings publicly announced interest from a
potential strategic acquiror. For purposes of computing the premiums to volume-weighted historical stock prices for Rawlings implied by the merger, George K. Baum used merger consideration of $9.00 per share based upon the limit established by the
exchange ratio in the merger agreement. This analysis indicated the following premiums:

by Rawlings stockholders as of December 15, 2002, based on the 0.950 exchange ratio. George K. Baum performed this analysis using estimates of projected financial performance prepared by the respective management of Rawlings and K2. Historical
financial data for K2 was based on publicly reported financial results as adjusted to exclude certain restructuring charges. The approximate range of Rawlings contribution and pro forma ownership resulting from the analysis is summarized

The foregoing does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by George K. Baum, but describes, in summary form, the principal elements of the analyses performed by George K. Baum in arriving at its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving subjective
judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, George K. Baum did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, George K. Baums analysis must be considered as a whole. Selecting portions of its opinion and factors considered by George K. Baum, without considering
all the analysis and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying such analyses and George K. Baums opinion. The description of the analyses set forth herein does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses underlying George K. Baums opinion. 

Fee and Other
Information.
    George K. Baum was selected as a financial advisor by the Rawlings board of directors in connection with the merger based upon its knowledge and familiarity with Rawlings as well as George K. Baums
qualifications, expertise and reputation, including the fact that it is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Pursuant to a letter agreement by and between Rawlings and George K. Baum dated May 30, 2002, upon consummation
of the merger, George K. Baum is entitled to a cash fee equal to 1.50% of the sum of (1) the merger consideration plus (2) the average amount of Rawlings debt for the 12 months preceding the closing of the merger. For rendering its opinion,
George K. Baum is entitled to a cash fee of $200,000 that is creditable against the fee George K. Baum is entitled to upon the consummation of the merger but was not contingent upon

THE MERGER



the conclusion reached in the opinion or the consummation of the merger. Rawlings also agreed to reimburse George K. Baum for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including without limitation,
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by George K. Baum, and to indemnify George K. Baum and certain affiliates against certain liabilities relating to, or arising out of, its engagement, including,
without limitation, certain liabilities under Federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with George K. Baum, which are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arms length between Rawlings and George K.
Baum, and the Rawlings board of directors approved such arrangement. George K. Baum has previously rendered investment banking services to Rawlings for which George K. Baum received customary compensation. 

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 

The following discussion is a
summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, the related Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and the conclusions discussed below and the tax consequences of the merger to Rawlings stockholders. This discussion applies only to Rawlings stockholders
that hold their shares of Rawlings common stock, and will hold the shares of K2 common stock received in the merger, as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. This discussion does not address all federal
income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to particular holders, including holders that are subject to special tax rules. Some examples of holders that are subject to special tax rules are: 



dealers in securities; 



financial institutions; 



insurance companies; 



tax-exempt organizations; 



holders of shares of Rawlings stock as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging or conversion transaction;



holders who have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; 



holders who are foreign persons; 



holders who own their shares indirectly through partnerships, trusts or other entities that may be subject to special treatment; and 



holders who acquired their shares of Rawlings common stock through stock option or stock purchase programs or otherwise as compensation. 

In addition, K2 and Rawlings are not addressing any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local
or foreign jurisdiction. 
Rawlings stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws and of changes in
applicable tax laws
.

Tax Consequences of the Merger.    
The obligations of
Rawlings and K2 to complete the merger are conditioned upon the delivery of an opinion to K2 and to Rawlings by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and/or by Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP that, for federal income tax purposes, the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions of counsel will be given in reliance on representations and covenants including those contained in certificates executed by officers of
Rawlings and K2. These opinions are not binding on the courts or the Internal Revenue Service, nor do they preclude the Internal Revenue Service from adopting a position contrary to that expressed in the opinions. No assurance can be given that
contrary positions will not successfully be asserted by the Internal

THE MERGER



Revenue Service or adopted by a court if the issues are litigated. Neither Rawlings nor K2 intends to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the federal income tax
consequences of the merger. 

Assuming that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the following material federal income tax consequences will result from the Merger: 



Rawlings stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of their shares of Rawlings common stock for shares of K2 common stock in the
merger, except with respect to any gain or loss attributable to cash received instead of fractional shares of K2 common stock; 



the aggregate tax basis of the shares of K2 common stock received in exchange for shares of Rawlings common stock in the merger, including a fractional share of
K2 common stock for which cash is paid, will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Rawlings common stock surrendered in the merger; 



the holding period for shares of K2 common stock received in the merger in exchange for shares of Rawlings common stock will include the holding period for the
Rawlings common stock surrendered; 



cash payments received by Rawlings stockholders instead of a fractional share of K2 common stock will be treated as received in exchange for that fractional
share interest, and gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes on receipt of the cash payment, measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the basis of the Rawlings common stock allocable to
the fractional share interest. The gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the Rawlings common stock is considered to have been held for more than one year at the time of the merger; and 



none of K2, Lara Acquisition Sub or Rawlings will recognize any gain or loss solely as a result of the merger. 

If the Internal Revenue Service determines successfully that the merger is not a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code, Rawlings stockholders would be required to recognize gain or loss with respect to each share of Rawlings common stock surrendered in the merger in an amount equal to the difference between the tax basis in that share of
stock and the fair market value of the K2 common stock received in exchange therefor. In such event, a Rawlings stockholders aggregate tax basis in the K2 common stock received in the merger would equal its fair market value, and the
stockholders holding period for the K2 common stock would begin the day after the merger. 

Information
Reporting and Backup Withholding.    
Certain U.S. holders may be subject to information reporting with respect to the amount of cash, if any, received instead of a fractional share interest in shares of K2 common stock. U.S.
holders who are subject to information reporting and who do not provide appropriate information when requested may also be subject to backup withholding. Any amount withheld under such rules is not an additional tax and may be refunded or credited
against such U.S. holders federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is properly furnished in a timely manner to the Internal Revenue Service. 

Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

K2 will use the purchase method of accounting for
the merger with Rawlings under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Therefore, the purchase price will be allocated to Rawlings assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair market values at the time of
completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price over these fair market values will be accounted for as goodwill to the extent not identified as an intangible asset apart from goodwill. The reported financial condition and results of
operations of K2 issued after the merger will reflect the combined companys balances and results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of
Rawlings. 

THE MERGER



Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

In considering the recommendations of the
Rawlings board of directors regarding the merger, Rawlings stockholders should be aware that the directors and officers of Rawlings have interests in the merger that differ from those of other stockholders of Rawlings, as described below. The
Rawlings board of directors was aware of these matters and considered them in recommending and approving the merger. 

As a result of these interests, these directors and officers of Rawlings could be more likely to vote to adopt the merger agreement and authorize the merger than if they did not hold these interests, and may have reasons for doing so
that are not the same as the interests of Rawlings stockholders. Rawlings stockholders should consider whether these interest may have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger. 

Acceleration of Stock Options
.    Certain employees of Rawlings are eligible to receive, and have received,
stock options under Rawlings Long-Term Incentive Plan. By operation of the plan, options granted thereunder and held by employees will accelerate and become immediately exercisable upon the merger becoming effective. 

Severance Agreements.    
At the time the merger agreement was entered into, twenty-five Rawlings employees were
parties to severance agreements with Rawlings which provide for the payment of severance to the employees if they are terminated without cause or if they voluntarily terminate their employment with good reason, as such terms
are defined in the employees respective severance agreements. If the severance obligations in all of the severance agreements were triggered, the total payments required thereunder would exceed $3,000,000. The amount, if any, to be paid under
these severance agreements will depend on K2s and the employees actions subsequent to the merger, and cannot be specifically determined at this time. 

Possible Future Employment Arrangements.
    Although no employment or similar agreements have been entered into between K2 and members of Rawlings management, there have been
discussions between K2 management and certain officers of Rawlings regarding potential future employment agreements, including discussions with Rawlings Chief Executive Officer, Stephen M. OHara.

Post-Merger Board Membership
.    In connection with the merger, the members of the Rawlings board of directors
will cease to serve as directors. However, K2 has agreed to expand the number of directors of the K2 board by one and to elect
                        , a current Rawlings director, to serve as a director of K2 effective upon the closing of the merger.

Indemnification.    
The merger agreement provides that, after the merger, K2 will, as
permitted by law, indemnify persons who were directors or officers of Rawlings before the merger, who incur liabilities or losses from any threatened or actual claim or proceeding based on the merger agreement or on a claim that arises by reason of
the fact that the person was a director or officer of Rawlings. In addition, K2 agreed to fulfill and honor any indemnification agreements and the provisions of Rawlings certificate of incorporation and bylaws which provide for the
indemnification of officers and directors, as in effect on December 15, 2002. Finally, K2 has agreed to maintain in effect the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees,
and advancement of expenses currently in Lara Acquisition Subs certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

K2
has agreed to maintain in effect the current Rawlings directors and officers liability insurance for a period of six years after the completion of the merger. However, K2 is not required to expend in any year an amount in excess of 200%
of the current premium paid by Rawlings. If the aggregate expenditure on coverage exceeds that amount, K2 will purchase as much insurance as can be obtained for that amount. 

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals 

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may not be consummated unless certain filings have been submitted to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the United

THE MERGER



States Department of Justice and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. K2 and Rawlings have filed notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 with the FTC and with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. 

The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality of transactions like the merger under the antitrust laws. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take
any action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking the divestiture of substantial assets of K2 or Rawlings. In addition, under certain
circumstances, certain private parties, state attorneys general and other antitrust authorities may challenge the transaction under antitrust laws. 

The parties do not believe that any antitrust filings are required in any other jurisdiction prior to the completion of the merger, but will make any such filings if it is subsequently determined that
they are required. 

K2 and Rawlings believe that the completion of the merger will not violate any antitrust laws.
There can be no assurance, however, that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be. 

No Dissenters Appraisal Rights 

Dissenters appraisal rights are not
available with respect to a merger or consolidation by a corporation the shares of which are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, if such stockholders are required to receive only
shares of the surviving corporation, shares of any other corporation which are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, or a combination of the foregoing.
Therefore, stockholders of K2 and Rawlings will not be able to exercise any dissenters appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Listing on the New York Stock Exchange 

It is a condition to completion of the merger
that shares of K2 common stock issuable in connection with the merger be authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance. K2 has filed a listing application with the New York Stock Exchange to list the
shares of K2 common stock to be issued in the merger. 

Delisting and Deregistration of Rawlings Common Stock 

If the merger is completed,
Rawlings common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market System and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Federal Securities Law Consequences 

All shares of K2 common stock that Rawlings
stockholders receive in the merger will be freely transferable, except for shares of K2 common stock that are received by persons who are deemed to be affiliates of Rawlings under the Securities Act of 1933 at the time of the Rawlings special
meeting. These affiliates may resell the shares of K2 common stock they receive in the merger only in transactions permitted by Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act of 1933. Persons who may be
deemed to be affiliates of Rawlings for the above purposes generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Rawlings, and include directors and certain executive officers of Rawlings. The
merger agreement requires that Rawlings use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of these affiliates to deliver to Rawlings as soon as practicable a letter agreement to the effect that these persons will not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of the shares of K2 common stock issued to them in the merger in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the related SEC rules. All current Rawlings directors and executive officers have delivered such a letter agreement.

THE MERGER



Shares of K2 common stock held by persons who are or will become affiliates of K2
as of the time the vote is taken on the merger may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 144 or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act of 1933. In general, under Rule 144, an affiliate of K2 would
be entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of one percent of the number of shares of such class of stock then outstanding or the average weekly trading volume of the shares of such class of
stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a Form 144 with respect to such sale. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to certain requirements pertaining to the manner of such sales, notices of such sales and the availability of
current public information concerning the issuer. 

In general, Rule 145(d) will impose the same volume and manner
of sale limitations as Rule 144 as to sales made during the one year period following the merger. During the period between the first and second year following consummation of the merger, resales by persons subject to Rule 145(d) are permitted to be
made without any volume or manner of sale of limitations if K2 is current in meeting its reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There are no limitations on resales by persons who are subject to Rule 145(d) after two
years have elapsed following the merger if such persons are not then affiliates of K2 and have not been so affiliated during the preceding three months. 

The document does not cover any resales of K2 common stock to be received by the Rawlings stockholders upon completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of the document in
connection with any such resale. 

THE MERGER



THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary of the material terms and
provisions of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement. The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. K2 and Rawlings stockholders should read the merger agreement in its entirety, as it is the legal document governing this merger and the provisions of the merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized.

The Merger 

The merger agreement provides that upon closing, Lara Acquisition Sub, a
wholly owned subsidiary of K2, will merge with and into Rawlings, with Rawlings as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Rawlings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2. 

Effective Time and Timing of Closing 

The merger will be completed and become effective
when the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as K2 and Rawlings may agree and as is specified in the certificate of merger, in accordance with Delaware law. The closing of the
merger will take place on the second business day after all conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived, or on such other date as K2 and Rawlings may agree. The companies currently anticipate completion of the merger shortly after the K2
and Rawlings special meetings, assuming K2s and Rawlings stockholders approve the merger at the meetings and all other conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived. 

Merger Consideration 

Exchange Ratio
.    At the effective
time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Rawlings common stock will automatically be converted into shares of K2 common stock based on an exchange ratio equal to 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings common
stock, unless the base trading price, as described below, is: 



less than $9.47, in which case the exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $9.00 by the base trading price, rounded to the third (3rd) decimal point; or



greater than $10.53, in which case the exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $10.00 by the base trading price, rounded to the third (3rd) decimal point.

The base trading price of a share of K2 common stock is the average daily closing
price per share of K2 common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions reporting system for the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the date of the closing of the
merger. 

Fractional Shares
.    Certificates for fractional shares of K2 common stock
will not be issued in the merger. Rawlings stockholders who would otherwise receive a fractional share will instead receive a cash payment equal to the value of the fractional share based on multiplying (i) the closing price of a share of K2 common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the New York City edition of the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another nationally recognized source, on the date the merger becomes effective, by (ii) the fractional share
interest. 

Adjustments
.    The exchange ratio will be adjusted to reflect the effects
of any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or the like on Rawlings or K2 common stock between December 15, 2002 and the time the merger becomes effective. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT



What Rawlings Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger 

Computer Trust Company, Inc.
will act as exchange agent in the merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the merger becomes effective, the exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each registered holder of Rawlings common stock. Each holder must properly
complete and deliver such letter to the exchange agent along with his or her Rawlings share certificates. 

After a
record holder of shares of Rawlings common stock delivers certificates for his or her shares along with a properly completed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent, the exchange agent will deliver to the holder: 



the whole number of shares of K2 common stock such holder has a right to receive in the merger in exchange for his or her shares of Rawlings common stock; and



a check in the amount of cash payable instead of any fractional share of K2 common stock, if any, plus any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, that the
holder has the right to receive in the merger. 

Shares of Rawlings common stock surrendered to
the exchange agent will be cancelled. No interest will accrue or be paid on any amount payable to Rawlings stockholders. In addition, no holder of shares of Rawlings common stock will receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of K2 common stock to which the holder is entitled until that holders Rawlings common share certificates are surrendered to the exchange agent with a properly completed letter of transmittal. 

Treatment of Rawlings Stock Options 

Options to purchase Rawlings common stock were
issued pursuant to the Rawlings Long Term Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Stock Plans. The options granted to non-director employees pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan, to the extent they were not previously exercisable, accelerate
upon the effective time of the merger. However, the options granted pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Stock Plans do not accelerate upon the effective time of the merger. 

Each outstanding option to purchase Rawlings common stock will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of K2 common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Rawlings common stock issuable upon exercise of the option immediately prior to the merger by the same exchange ratio described under Merger Consideration on page 58, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
The exercise price per K2 common share for each of these options will be: 



the aggregate exercise price for the Rawlings common shares under that option immediately prior to the merger becoming effective, 
divided
 by



the product of the number of Rawlings shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such option and the exchange ratio discussed above, rounded up to the nearest
cent. 

The replacement options will generally have the same terms and conditions as those under
the applicable Rawlings option plans. In the case of incentive stock options, K2 will, if necessary, adjust the conversion formula to comply with Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

K2 will file a registration statement with the SEC within ten business days after the merger becomes effective to register the shares of K2 common stock issuable upon
exercise of Rawlings stock options assumed in the merger. K2 will use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement covering these assumed stock options as long as they remain outstanding.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT



Preparation of Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus 

K2 and
Rawlings are obligated to cooperate in the preparation and the filing of mutually acceptable proxy materials with the SEC in the form of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, which relates to the matters to be submitted to the stockholder votes of
both companies. 

K2 is also obligated to prepare and file the S-4 registration statement with the SEC, of which
this joint proxy statement/prospectus serves as the prospectus. Both K2 and Rawlings are obligated to use their best efforts to have: 



this joint proxy statement/prospectus cleared by the SEC, 



this joint proxy statement/prospectus promptly mailed to the K2 and Rawlings stockholders after the S-4 becomes effective, 



the S-4 declared effective by the SEC, and 



the S-4 remain effective as long as necessary to consummate the merger and any transactions contemplated by the merger. 

K2 and Rawlings are obligated to provide each other with copies of any written comments and advise the other party as to any
oral comments received from the SEC regarding this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the S-4. In addition, both K2 and Rawlings shall provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or the S-4 before such amendment or supplement is filed with the SEC. Further, no such amendment or supplement will be made without both K2s and Rawlings approval, which cannot be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. For documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, this right of approval applies only to the extent such incorporated documents relate to the merger agreement, the transactions set forth in the merger
agreement, the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations. 

If, prior to the merger
becoming effective, either K2 or Rawlings obtains information or takes any action which causes this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the S-4 to contain a misstatement of material fact or to fail to contain any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading if not included in an amendment thereto, the party obtaining the knowledge or taking the action is obligated to promptly notify the other party. Thereafter,
K2 and Rawlings shall cooperate in filing with the SEC any amendment or supplement required by law and providing such information to the stockholders of each company. Both parties are also obligated to provide each other with prompt notification of

parties to obtain the stockholder approval of both companies required to consummate the merger and the other transactions set forth in the merger agreement. In addition, both companies shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of the
merger agreement. 

Offers for Alternative Transactions 

Rawlings has agreed not to: 



continue any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with other persons as to a possible third party acquisition, as defined below; 



encourage, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate the submission of any proposal for a third party acquisition; 



participate in, or initiate any discussions or negotiations regarding a third party acquisition; 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT





provide any non-public information about Rawlings or its subsidiaries in connection with a third party acquisition; 



knowingly facilitate any third party acquisition, or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to
any third party acquisition; or 



enter into any agreement regarding any third party acquisition. 

Rawlings has also agreed not to authorize or permit any of its affiliates or subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other representatives or agents to take any of the above-listed actions. However, if Rawlings receives an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a third party acquisition, Rawlings may, after promptly giving K2 advance
written notice thereof: 



furnish information with respect to Rawlings pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form; and 



renew or enter into discussions and negotiations with the persons that made such proposal; 

but only if Rawlings board of directors reasonably determined in good faith by majority vote that: 



based on advice from independent legal counsel, failure to take such would be reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach by the Rawlings board of
directors of its fiduciary duties; and 



taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposed third party acquisition, such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a superior proposal, as defined below, which if accepted, is reasonably capable of being consummated after such proposal is revised to reflect any information requested by such third party. 

A third party acquisition includes: 



the acquisition by any person other than K2 or any of its affiliates of assets of Rawlings and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, representing 20% or more of
the aggregate fair market value of Rawlings business immediately prior to such acquisition, not including the sale or license of products in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices; 



the acquisition by a third party of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock; 



the adoption by Rawlings of a plan of liquidation; 



the declaration or payment by Rawlings of an extraordinary dividend, whether in cash or other property; 



the repurchase by Rawlings or any of its subsidiaries of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock; or 



the acquisition by Rawlings or any of its subsidiaries by merger, purchase of stock or assets, joint venture or otherwise, of a direct or indirect ownership
interest or investment in any person or business whose annual revenues or assets are equal to or greater than 20% of the annual revenues or assets of Rawlings and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the twelve month period ended September 30,
2002. 

A superior proposal means a bona fide proposal to acquire, directly or
indirectly in one or a series of related transactions, 80% or more of the shares of then outstanding Rawlings common stock or 80% or more of the fair market value of the assets of Rawlings or any material subsidiary, for consideration consisting of
cash and/or securities, which is on terms the Rawlings board of directors, after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, has determined by majority vote would result in a transaction more favorable to
Rawlings stockholders than the proposed merger with K2. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT



Rawlings has agreed to notify K2 within twenty-four hours of receipt of any
proposal for or inquiry regarding a third party acquisition, or any request for nonpublic information by any party making or considering making a third party acquisition proposal as to Rawlings or any of its subsidiaries. Such notice shall include
the material terms of the request or proposal and the identity of the person making it. In addition, Rawlings has agreed to provide K2 with a copy of any written third party acquisition proposal, including any updates of such proposals, to keep K2
fully informed of the status of such third party acquisition proposals and to provide a copy of any information delivered to such person which has not previously been made available to K2. 

Rawlings Board of Directors Recommendations and Entering into Acquisition Agreement with Third Party 

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Rawlings board of directors has agreed to recommend that its stockholders approve the merger and the merger agreement. The Rawlings board of directors also agreed to neither
withdraw, adversely modify, or propose to withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of the merger in a manner adverse to K2, nor approve or recommend any third party acquisition. However, the Rawlings board of directors may take any of the
above prohibited actions, recommend a superior proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 



Rawlings received an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a third party acquisition which the Rawlings board of directors, by a majority vote, reasonably
determines in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, that if accepted, is likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the third party making the proposal; 



the Rawlings board of directors determines in good faith by majority vote, after receiving advice from independent legal counsel, that failure to take such
otherwise prohibited action would be reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach by the Rawlings board of directors of its fiduciary duties; 



the Rawlings board of directors provides K2 prior written notice specifying the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal and identifying the
person making the superior proposal; 



K2 does not, within three business days after receipt of the notice of a superior proposal, make an offer that the Rawlings board of directors, by majority
vote, determines in its good faith judgment after receiving the advice of a financial advisor of nationally-recognized reputation, to be at least as favorable to the Rawlings stockholders as the superior proposal; and 



before entering into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, this merger must be terminated and Rawlings must pay K2 a termination fee of $2,900,000
as described below. 

The merger agreement permits Rawlings to comply with its fiduciary duties
or with Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to required disclosure in connection with receipt of any third party acquisition proposal or otherwise. 

Indemnification and Insurance 

The merger agreement sets forth that, after the merger,
to the extent not covered by insurance and as permitted by law, K2 will indemnify persons who were directors or officers of Rawlings or its subsidiaries prior to the merger becoming effective who incur liabilities or losses from any threatened or
actual claim or proceeding based on the merger agreement or a claim arising by reason of the fact that the person was a director or officer of Rawlings or its subsidiaries. In addition, K2 has agreed to fulfill and honor any indemnification
agreements and the provisions of Rawlings certificate of incorporation and bylaws which provide for the indemnification of officers and directors as in effect on December 15, 2002. Finally, K2 has agreed to maintain in effect the current
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees, and advancement of expenses currently in Lara Acquisition Subs certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT



K2 has agreed to maintain in effect, if available, the current Rawlings
directors and officers liability insurance for six years after the completion of the merger. However, K2 is not required to expend an amount in excess of 200% of the current premium paid by Rawlings in any one year. If the aggregate
expenditure on coverage exceeds that amount, K2 will purchase as much insurance as can be obtained for that amount. Instead of maintaining such existing insurance, K2 may provide coverage under any policy maintained for the benefit of K2 or its
subsidiaries on terms no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries as the existing insurance. 

Employee Benefits 

After completion of the merger, K2 will assume and honor all
Rawlings employee benefit plans, agreements and programs according to the terms in effect immediately prior to the completion of the merger, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms or as otherwise
permitted by applicable law. In addition, K2 will provide all employees of Rawlings immediately prior to completion of the merger who become employees of K2 after completion of the merger, compensation and employee benefits for at least one year
following completion of the merger that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those available to Rawlings employees immediately prior to completion of the merger. 

K2 may provide Rawlings employees with compensation and employee benefits through K2s employee benefit plans and programs in lieu of any Rawlings benefit plans and
programs; however, such compensation and benefits must be as favorable as those provided to similarly situated employees of K2. Discretionary equity and equity based awards shall remain discretionary. Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the
termination of a Rawlings employee or the amendment or termination of any employee benefit plan or program, to the extent permitted by the terms as in effect immediately prior to completion of the merger, or by law. 

Rawlings Shareholder Rights Plan 

Rawlings agreed to either: 



promptly redeem all preferred share purchase rights under the Rawlings shareholder rights plan; or 



amend the Rawlings shareholder rights plan to exempt the merger and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from the plan.

an exclusive basis, to a number of leagues and organizations including the NCAA, the NJCAA, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Mens Senior Baseball League, Little League Baseball and a number of international baseball

including full-grain, composite and synthetic leather and rubber basketballs for men and women in both the youth and adult markets. Rawlings recently introduced its patented Ten basketball which uses ten panels to improve handling, grip, control,

Apparel.
    Rawlings has been selling team uniforms for approximately 100 years. Under an agreement with Major
League Baseball that expired in December 2002, Rawlings was the official uniform for eight Major League Baseball teams and has the exclusive retail rights for authentic uniforms for these teams. Rawlings determined that the cost of this contract was
not an economically justifiable expense and so did not renew the contract when it expired. Rawlings also sells uniforms to 80 Minor League teams. Apparel comprised 14.3% of Rawlings net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002. Approximately
37% of the apparel revenues were from sales of custom uniforms, which are manufactured in Rawlings Licking, Missouri facility. Rawlings has announced its intention to close the Licking facility in mid 2003 and move production to Rawlings
Costa Rica and Washington, Missouri facilities. Rawlings believes it has growth opportunities in its current team apparel business and in the larger active wear apparel market. Rawlings has recently reorganized its marketing team to better focus on
building its apparel business. 

INFORMATION ABOUT RAWLINGS



Miscellaneous.
    Rawlings derives other net revenues
from its outlet store and from its leather tanning facility. The outlet store sells seconds, irregular quality, discontinued and overstocked items. Approximately 35% of the leather tanned at Rawlings tanning facility is sold to third
parties for use in a variety of products. 

Licensing 

For the year ended August 31, 2002, Rawlings generated $5,500,000 of
licensing revenues on approximately $121,000,000 of sales made by third parties in Japan, the United States and Italy. These sales were of products on which the Rawlings


brand name appeared under licensing agreements. Rawlings has licensed the use of its brand name since the mid-1970s when it licensed a Japanese company to use the Rawlings


brand name on clothing sold in Japan. Since then, Rawlings has licensed its name to ASICS Corporation, a leading Japanese sporting goods company, for use on all types of baseball equipment, team uniforms and clothing sold in Japan. In 2000, the
license with ASICS Corporation was expanded to include all active wear in Japan. 

In the United States, Rawlings
currently has licensing agreements with 12 companies, which are using the Rawlings

 brand name on various products including shoes, socks, games and toys, golf equipment, sports bags, apparel and
baseball accessories. Rawlings also has a licensing agreement with a company in Italy selling activewear. Rawlings retains the right under its licensing agreements to sample and inspect all licensed products to ensure that products bearing the
Rawlings

 brand name meet Rawlings quality standards. 

Rawlings intends to continue to license the Rawlings

 brand name to strategically extend the name to other related quality products and to new geographic areas. Rawlings believes that such
strategic licensing will enhance Rawlings image, consumer recognition and sales of all of its products. In July, 2002 Rawlings entered into an agreement with Equity Management, Inc., a licensing management firm, to expand Rawlings
licensing line and manage the overall program.

Foreign 

Rawlings foreign net revenues constituted approximately 4.7% of its
total net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002. Rawlings currently distributes its products in more than 55 countries primarily through independent distributors. Of Rawlings foreign net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002,
approximately $4,200,000, or 2.4% of total net sales, came from direct sales in Canada. 

Rawlings works closely
with foreign sports organizations to build participation levels in American team sports outside of the U.S. Rawlings supplies baseball, basketball and football equipment and team uniforms to international sports organizations, and to leagues in
Puerto Rico and various foreign countries. Due to the growing international popularity of American team sports, Rawlings believes that opportunities exist to increase its foreign net revenues.

United States, Rawlings sells directly to approximately 4,700 customers including local sporting goods stores, institutional dealers - entities that service the sports equipment needs of high school, collegiate and amateur sports organizations,
regional sporting goods chains such as Dicks and Modells, national sporting goods chains such as Garts and The Sports Authority and mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart. In recent years, sales to sporting goods

2002 including Wal-Mart which accounted for approximately 17% of 2002 net revenues.

manufacturers representatives. In addition, seven employees directly service professional and college teams, coaches and athletes. Rawlings primarily utilizes distributors to sell products overseas, except in Japan, which is covered by
licensing agreements. Rawlings products are currently distributed from its facilities in Washington and Licking, Missouri; Dolgeville, New York; Tullahoma, Tennessee and Brantford, Ontario, Canada. 

The consolidation of Rawlings distribution facilities formerly located in Springfield, Missouri to a single location in Washington,
Missouri was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Distribution formerly at Ava, Missouri was consolidated into Washington in the first quarter of 2002 and distribution currently handled in Licking, Missouri is expected to be consolidated
into Washington in 2003. 

Rawlings utilizes a variety of promotional techniques to build brand awareness. Since
1958, Rawlings has annually presented the Rawlings Gold Glove Award

 to the best fielder at each position in each of the National and American Leagues. The Rawlings Gold Glove Award

 is the most prestigious award a baseball player can receive for his fielding abilities. In addition, Rawlings promotes its products through the Rawlings Sports Caravan and other promotional vehicles. The Rawlings
Sports Caravan is comprised of a tandem tractor trailer containing exhibits on the evolution of baseball, basketball and football equipment and uniforms, and a workshop in which demonstrations on the manufacture and repair of baseball gloves, balls
and bats are performed. In addition, the Caravan appears at sports events such as spring training, opening day games, the All-Star Game, the World Series games and the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Rawlings also promotes its products
through product endorsements by numerous professional athletes, coaches and sports organizations. Rawlings makes available to retailers various cooperative advertising programs and participates in selected joint marketing and advertising programs.

Affiliations and Endorsements 

Rawlings has the right to use the logos of several
professional and amateur sports organizations and events on certain of its products. These arrangements include: Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. covering National League, American League, All-Star, World Series, Divisional Playoffs and League
Championship Series games; NCAA baseball games; the Minor League games of 19 Minor Leagues; the National Federation of State High School Associations; the NAIA; the NJCAA; and the Mens Senior Baseball League. 

In addition, Rawlings baseball products are endorsed by numerous athletes, including approximately 700 Major League Baseball
players. Endorsing players include Ken Griffey Jr., Derek Jeter, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Alex Rodriquez and Sammy Sosa. Rawlings basketball products carry endorsements from approximately 24 college coaches including
basketballs Lute Olson, Quin Snyder, and Kristy Curry. Rawlings football products are endorsed by Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts. 

Rawlings believes that endorsements by professional athletes and college coaches and affiliations with sports organizations enhance Rawlings image and improve sales of its products.
Rawlings strategy is to obtain a broad array of endorsements and affiliations from national and regional sports organizations, select college coaches and professional athletes in order to position its products to appeal to regional customer
preferences, as well as to achieve national recognition. 

The licensing agreements with Major League Baseball
Properties, Inc. and the 19 Minor Leagues, under which Rawlings is licensed to produce the baseballs used in the Major League games, All-Star, World Series, Divisional Playoffs and League Championship Series games, the official baseballs for the
Minor League games, the NCAA baseball contract, and the National Federation of State High School Associations baseball, softball, basketball, football, soccer ball and volleyball contract, provide that the agreements will be subject to termination
upon a change of control of Rawlings, as defined in the agreements, unless the change of control is approved by

Manufacturing, Product Procurement and Raw Materials 

Products manufactured in
Rawlings five plants constituted approximately 23% of its net revenues in the year ended August 31, 2002. The balance of net revenues was derived from licensing fees and the sale of products manufactured by third-parties in Asia, Latin
America, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. The third-party sourced products are manufactured according to Rawlings specifications. Five third-party manufacturers account for approximately 61% of Rawlings raw material and
finished goods purchases. Rawlings seeks to establish and build close working relationships with its third-party manufacturers that emphasize service, quality, reliability, loyalty and commitment. Rawlings continually monitors its sourced products
to ensure they meet Rawlings quality standards. Rawlings arrangements with its non U.S. suppliers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad. Rawlings believes that the loss of any one of its non U.S. manufacturers, while causing
temporary difficulties, would not have a material adverse effect on Rawlings business and results of operations because other manufacturers are available to fulfill Rawlings requirements. 

Rawlings operates five manufacturing facilities in the United States and Costa Rica where it makes baseballs, apparel, baseball gloves,
injection molded batters helmets and wood baseball bats, tans leather and performs other miscellaneous value added processes. Rawlings recently announced its intention to close the Licking, Missouri apparel manufacturing facility in mid 2003.
Production will be moved to Rawlings Costa Rica and Washington, Missouri facilities. The relocation of the manufacturing operations performed at Ava, Missouri to the new location in Washington, Missouri began in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001 and was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Rawlings philosophy is to manufacture internally when it provides a competitive advantage; otherwise, Rawlings seeks to outsource production. 

Rawlings obtains its raw materials from various sources it considers adequate for fulfilling its requirements. To assure access to the
highest quality leather for its baseballs, Rawlings acquired its Tennessee leather tanning facility in 1985. Rawlings depends upon a limited number of vendors for leather for its Pro Preferred


and Heart of the Hide

 baseball gloves. If any of these sources of raw materials were unavailable to Rawlings, Rawlings operations could be adversely affected
until alternative sources were found in the necessary quantities. 

Trademarks and Patents 

The Rawlings


brand name and logo and the red R


 logo, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Finest in the Field

,
Rawlings Gold Glove Award

, The Mark of a Pro

, and ProPreferred


are protected trademarks in various countries. As of August 31, 2002, Rawlings held 35 U.S. and eight non U.S. patents, and had three U.S. and 23 non U.S. patent applications pending. Although Rawlings believes that collectively its patents are
important to its business, the loss of any one patent would not have a material adverse effect on Rawlings business and results of operations. 

Competition 

Rawlings competes with numerous national and international companies which
manufacture and distribute broad lines of sporting goods and related equipment and sports clothing as well as numerous manufacturers and suppliers of a limited variety of such products. Certain of Rawlings competitors offer sports equipment
not sold by Rawlings. Some of Rawlings competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than Rawlings. Rawlings principal competitors include Wilson Sporting Goods Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of
Amer Group Ltd.), Nike, Easton, Hillerich & Bradsby, and Mizuno Company Limited in the baseball product line; Wilson Sporting Goods Company, Spalding, Nike and Riddell Sports Inc. in the basketball and football lines; and Russell Corporation,
Majestic and Wilson Sporting Goods Company in the apparel line. While Rawlings is one of the leading manufacturers and distributors of team sports equipment in North America,

INFORMATION ABOUT RAWLINGS



competition in the sporting goods industry is intense and is based upon quality, price, product features and brand recognition. In addition, the competitive barriers to entry into the sporting
goods industry in general are not significant. 

Seasonality 

Net revenues of baseball equipment and team uniforms are highly seasonal.
Customers generally place pre-season orders with Rawlings for baseball-related products beginning in August for shipment beginning in November. These pre-season orders from customers generally represent approximately 50% to 65% of the
customers anticipated needs for the entire baseball season. The amount of these pre-season orders generally determines Rawlings net revenues and profitability between November 1 and February 28. Rawlings then receives additional fill-in
orders which depend upon customers actual sales of products during the baseball season (sell-through). Fill-in orders are typically received by Rawlings between February and May. These orders generally represent approximately 35% to 50% of
Rawlings sales of baseball-related products during a particular season. 

Pre-season orders for certain
baseball-related products from certain customers are not required to be paid until early spring. These extended terms increase the risk of collectibility of accounts receivable. Most of Rawlings large customers are on automatic replenishment
systems; therefore, more orders are received on a ship-at-once basis. This results in Rawlings producing or purchasing inventory against customer forecasts and shipping to the customer closer to the time the products are actually sold. This process
to meet orders for immediate delivery increases inventory and debt levels and creates inventory forecast risks. To offset these risks, Rawlings has a Port of Entry program to encourage retailers to place and receive early orders. 

The sell-through of baseball-related products also affects the amount of inventory held by customers at the end of the season,
which is carried over by the customer for sale in the next baseball season. Customers typically adjust their pre-season orders for the next baseball season to account for the level of inventory carried over from the preceding baseball season.
Football equipment and team uniforms are both shipped by Rawlings and sold by retailers primarily in the period between March 1 and September 30. Basketballs and team uniforms generally are shipped and sold throughout the year. Because
Rawlings sales of baseball-related products exceed those of its other products, Rawlings business is seasonal, with its highest net revenues and profitability recognized between November 1 and April 30. 

Employees 

As of August 31, 2002, Rawlings employed approximately 935 people on a
full-time basis, of whom 482 were based in the United States, 445 in Costa Rica and 8 in Canada. Of the total number of employees, approximately 780 were engaged in manufacturing and distribution, 108 were engaged in marketing and sales and 47 were
engaged in administration. Approximately 128 of Rawlings domestic employees are represented by the Union of Needletrades of Industrial Textile Employees, AFL-CIO-CLC or the Local 682 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs,
Warehousemen and Helpers of America, under collective bargaining agreements which expire in November 2003 and February 2003, respectively. Both of these agreements automatically renew for a period of twelve months from year to year thereafter,
unless modified or terminated by written notice at least sixty days prior to any subsequent anniversary date. Rawlings believes that relations with its employees are good and that the collective bargaining agreements will be extended without
material changes from the current contract. 

In addition, as of August 31, 2002 approximately 172 people were
engaged in manufacturing and distribution at Rawlings Washington, Missouri location under an employee lease agreement.

Quarter Ended November 30, 2002 

Quarter Ended November 30, 2002 Compared with
Quarter Ended November 30, 2001 

Results of Operations.
    Rawlings net
revenues for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 were $29,974,000 or 10.3% below net revenues of $33,408,000 for the quarter ended November 30, 2001. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to lower sales of footballs, basketballs and apparel
partially offset by improved sales of baseball-related products. 

Rawlings gross profit margin for the
quarter ended November 30, 2002 was 29.9%, 1.6 margin points above the 28.3% gross profit margin for the quarter ended November 30, 2001. The gross profit for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 was $8,948,000 or 5.3% below the comparable period
last year. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily due to increased margins in baseball-related products, apparel and footballs. The lower revenues partially offset by the gross margin improvements accounted for the gross profit
reduction. 

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 were
$9,459,000 or $570,000 below the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses were 31.6% of net revenues or 1.6 percentage points above the November 2001 quarter due to the lower sales level. Decreased royalties, due to the expiration of the NCAA
basketball contract, professional fees and commissions contributed to the reduced SG&A expenses. 

Interest
expense for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 was $533,000 or 15.9% below the $634,000 interest expense in the comparable quarter last year. Lower average borrowings of $8,700,000 accounted for the decrease in interest expense. 

Net loss of $658,000 for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 was an improvement of $140,000 compared to the net loss for the
November 2001 quarter. Reduced SG&A expenses, a higher gross profit margin and decreased interest expense partially offset by lower net revenues contributed to the improved net loss. 

K2 Inc. Merger.
    On December 16, 2002, Rawlings and K2 Inc. announced the signing of a definitive stock-for-stock merger agreement in which
Rawlings will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 Inc. Under terms of the agreement, each share of Rawlings common stock will be converted into 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock, subject to a collar mechanism. If the average closing price of K2
common stock for the fifteen trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date exceeds $10.53 per share, the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number
of shares of K2 common stock, based on the average closing price of K2 common stock, having a value of $10.00 per share. If the average closing price of K2 common stock is less than $9.47 per share, the exchange ratio will be adjusted upward to an
exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock, based on the average closing price of K2 common stock, having a value of $9.00 per share. If the merger is not completed, Rawlings, under
certain circumstances, could be required to pay K2 Inc. a termination fee of $2,900,000. K2 Inc. has agreed, upon completion of the merger, to reimburse Rawlings for $163,000 of merger related expenses incurred in the quarter ended November 30,
2002. The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2003. K2 Inc. is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of brand-name sporting goods, recreational and industrial products. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources
.    Working capital decreased by $1,191,000 during the three months ended
November 30, 2002. This decrease was primarily a result of increases in short-term borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and accounts payable and was partially offset by a seasonal increase in inventories and accounts receivable.

RAWLINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 was
$9,595,000. This was $3,008,000 greater than the $6,587,000 used in the comparable quarter last year. The increase in cash used was due to a smaller increase in accounts payable and a larger increase in accounts receivable. 

Capital expenditures were $423,000 in the quarter ended November 30, 2002 compared to $657,000 in the comparable quarter of the prior
year. The November 2001 quarter included expenditures related to expanding the Washington, Missouri facility for certain manufacturing operations. Rawlings expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 to be approximately $1,400,000. 

Rawlings had an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to seasonal working capital needs, of $9,683,000 in the quarter
ended November 30, 2002. This resulted in total debt as of November 30, 2002 of $39,661,000. This was $6,436,000 or 14.0% lower than the total debt of $46,097,000 as of November 30, 2001. 

Rawlings primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and the credit agreement with a financial institution entered into on December 28,
1999 and subsequently amended. The agreement provides for borrowings based on a percentage of qualified receivables and inventory. The facility also allows for a $2,000,000 seasonal advance from August 2002 through February 2003. Borrowings under
the agreement are based on an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. A commitment fee of 0.50% is charged on any unused portion of the facility. On November 14, 2002 Rawlings and its lenders amended the credit agreement to increase the seasonal advance
to $5,000,000 for the period from November 2002 through January 2003. Rawlings and its lenders also amended the credit agreement on December 11, 2002 to permit Rawlings to enter into a Single Customer Credit Approved Receivables Purchasing Agreement
with The CIT Group Commercial Services, Inc. to protect post-petition receivables from Kmart. 

The credit facility
includes various covenants, including requirements that Rawlings achieve certain EBITDA levels as defined in the agreement, maintain a fixed charge ratio, limit capital expenditures and restrict the payment of dividends. The covenants for EBITDA and
fixed charge ratio for the twelve months ended November 30, 2002 were $9,125,000 and 1.20, respectively. Actual EBITDA and fixed charge ratio for the same period were $9,529,000 and 1.58, respectively. The EBITDA requirement increases $125,000 for
each of the fiscal 2003 quarter-end compliance calculations that are based on a rolling four quarters of EBITDA resulting in a $9,500,000 requirement for the twelve months ending August 31, 2003. The covenant for fixed charge ratio for each
quarter-end calculation in fiscal 2003 is 1.20. As of November 30, 2002, Rawlings is in compliance with the debt covenants related to the credit facility. Total unused availability under the credit facility at November 30, 2002 was approximately
$3,445,000. 

Rawlings believes its capital structure and current credit facility are adequate to provide for its
short term and long term operations to the extent that Rawlings is able to satisfy the EBITDA and other covenants set forth in the credit facility. 

Seasonality
.    Net revenues of baseball equipment and team uniforms are highly seasonal. Customers generally place pre-season orders with Rawlings for baseball-related
products beginning in August for shipment beginning in November. These pre-season orders from customers generally represent approximately 50% to 65% of the customers anticipated needs for the entire baseball season. The amount of these

Year Ended August 31, 2002 

Year Ended August 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended
August 31, 2001 

Results of Operations.
    Net revenues for the year ended August
31, 2002 were $173,712,000 or 0.5% below net revenues of $174,528,000 for the year ended August 31, 2001. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to lower sales of footballs, basketballs and apparel partially offset by higher sales of
baseball-related products. 

Licensing revenues for 2002 were $5,546,000 or $475,000 above 2001. $373,000 of the
increase is primarily due to a 2002 early termination fee of a license agreement with a golf products licensee. Improved revenues from Rawlings footwear licensee partially offset by lower revenues from Asics, the Japanese licensee, also
contributed to the higher revenues in 2002. 

Gross profit in 2002 was $48,776,000, which was $1,244,000, or 2.6%,
greater than the gross profit of $47,532,000 in 2001. The gross profit margin of 28.1% for 2002 was 0.9 margin points above 2001. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher margins for baseball-related products partially offset by
decreased margins for basketballs and footballs. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $41,158,000 in
2002 were 2.2% above the same expenses in 2001. As a percent of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.7% in 2002 compared to 23.1% in the prior year. Increased distribution costs partially offset by lower professional
fees accounted for the higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 

In 2001, $1,527,000 of transition
costs were incurred during the relocation of distribution facilities to a new single location in Washington, Missouri. These transition costs offset by a $1,115,000 gain on the sale of the Springfield, Missouri distribution center were included as
unusual expenses in Rawlings Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended August 31, 2002, a copy of which is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Interest expense for 2002 was $2,452,000 or $2,058,000 below 2001. Lower average rates of 3.5 percentage points and lower average borrowings of $5,500,000 accounted for the
decrease in interest expense. 

Income taxes in 2002 of $1,819,000 were $1,233,000 greater than 2001. Higher pretax
income and a higher effective tax rate accounted for the income tax increase. The low 2001 effective tax rate of 25% was impacted by foreign source income.

Net income was $3,347,000 in 2002 or $1,590,000 greater than 2001. In 2002 income
per share of $0.41 was 86.4% above the $0.22 per share in 2001. 

Year Ended August 31, 2001 Compared to the
Year Ended August 31, 2000 

Results of Operations
.    Net revenues for 2001 of
$174,528,000 were $625,000, or 0.4% higher than the year ended August 31, 2000. The increase in net revenues was primarily the result of higher sales of apparel, footballs, and baseballs offset by lower sales of baseball gloves and reduced licensing
revenue. 

Revenues from licensing were $5,071,000 in 2001 or 8.8% below licensing revenues of $5,563,000 in 2000.
The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decline in Rawlings Japanese licensees revenues and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Rawlings activewear licensee and the footwear licensee also contributed to the lower revenues
partially offset by improved revenues from Rawlings sock licensee. 

Gross margin in 2001 was 27.2%, down 1.6
margin points from the prior year. The decrease reflects lower margins on baseballs and baseball gloves and the reduced licensing revenues. 

SG&A expenses decreased $173,000 in 2001. SG&A expenses as a percent of sales in 2001 were 23.1% compared to 23.3% in 2000. Lower depreciation, sales commissions and expenses related to sales
meetings offset by increases in advertising and promotion and endorsement contracts were primarily responsible for the net decrease. 

In connection with the relocation of distribution facilities to a new single location in Washington, Missouri, the Springfield, Missouri distribution center was sold in September 2000. The move to Washington was completed in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, transition and facility clean up costs incurred during the move to Washington of $1,527,000, offset by the gain of $1,115,000 on the sale of the Springfield facility, were included as unusual
expenses in Rawlings Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended August 31, 2002. A copy of the Consolidated Statement of Income is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Interest expense of $4,510,000 in 2001 was $1,554,000, or 25.6%, lower than the prior year. Lower debt levels, partially due to debt
repayments resulting from the proceeds from the sale of the Springfield distribution center and from the sale of the discontinued operation, along with lower rates, accounted for the reduction in interest expense. 

The effective tax rate for 2001 was 25% which is lower than the statutory rate of 35% because foreign income, which has lower tax rates,
represented a higher percent of income. There was also a decrease in Rawlings valuation allowance in 2001. 

Income from continuing operations increased $476,000, or 37.2% to $1,757,000 continuing the improvement trend, which began in 2000. 

The sale of the Vic hockey business was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 under substantially the same terms as originally provided in 2000. 

New Accounting Pronouncements
.    The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 143, Asset
Retirement Obligations. The new standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the
cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the
liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to impact our
consolidated financial position. Rawlings will adopt SFAS No. 143 in fiscal 2003. 

RAWLINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The new standard replaces FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The primary
objectives of this statement were to develop one accounting model, based on the framework established in Statement 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues. Statement 144 requires that all
long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. The standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial position. Rawlings will adopt SFAS No. 144 in fiscal 2003. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires that
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to impact our consolidation financial position. Rawlings will adopt SFAS No. 146 in fiscal 2003. 

Critical Accounting Policies
.    As discussed in Note 1 to Rawlings Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended August 31, 2002,
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A copy of Note 1 is included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. On
an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation; the allowance for doubtful accounts; depreciation and recoverability of long-lived assets; deferred income tax assets and the related
valuation allowance and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors. This information forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See Note 1 to Rawlings Consolidated Financial Statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of Rawlings significant accounting policies.

While Rawlings believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis
for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, Rawlings cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate. This could require Rawlings to make adjustments to these estimates in
future periods.

Law
.    Under Delaware General Corporation Law, the board of directors must have at least one director. A majority of the directors in office can fill any vacancy or newly created directorship. A director may be removed with
or without cause by a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of the directors. However, if the board is divided into classes, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, a director may only be removed for cause. The
board may fill any vacancy created for any reason. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

OF K2
AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS



K2.
    The K2 board of directors has eight members.
The K2 restated certificate of incorporation provides that the board shall consist of between eight and eleven members, as set by the board of directors. The board shall be divided into three nearly equal classes, with each class serving three year
terms. The K2 restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws are silent as to the filling of vacancies, the appointment of new directors to fill newly-created positions and the removal of directors. Therefore, as provided by Delaware General
Corporation Law, vacancies and newly created directorships are filled by a majority of the K2 directors in office. K2 has agreed to expand the number of directors of the K2 board by one and elect a current Rawlings director to serve as a director of
K2, effective upon the closing of the merger. 

Rawlings.
    The Rawlings board of
directors has five members. The Rawlings certificate of incorporation states that the Rawlings board of directors shall consist of between one and seven members, as set by the board of directors. The bylaws state that no person older than 66 years
old is eligible to be elected as a director. The board is to be divided into three nearly equal classes, as the number of directors constituting the entire board permits, with each class serving three year terms. Vacancies and newly created board
positions are filled by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office. A newly elected director will serve for the remainder of the term of the class of directors of which he or she is a member. Directors may only be removed for cause by
the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present and entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting. 

Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation 

Delaware General Corporation
Law.
    Under Delaware General Corporation Law, an amendment to a corporations certificate of incorporation requires approval by both the board and a majority of the shares entitled to vote, unless a different
proportion is provided for in the certificate of incorporation. If the amendment increases or decreases the aggregate number of authorized shares of a class, then the outstanding shares of the class shall be entitled to vote on the amendment whether
or not entitled to vote thereon by the certificate of incorporation. If the corporations stock is divided into classes, then a majority of each class entitled to vote on the amendment as a class must approve the amendment, unless a different
proportion is provided by the certificate of incorporation. 

K2
.    The K2 restated
certificate of incorporation may be amended or repealed as permitted or prescribed by applicable law and approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote. The K2 restated certificate of incorporation requires supermajority stockholder approval
with respect to amending certain provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, the affirmative vote of holders of at least: 



two-thirds of the outstanding shares of K2 stock will be required for K2 to amend Article Fourteen of its restated certificate of incorporation, which requires
the approval of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote for any merger or consolidation of K2 with another entity, or the sale or other transfer of substantially all of the assets of K2; 



80% of the shares entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, and two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote and held by stockholders other than an
interested stockholder will be required to amend Article Fifteen of K2s restated certificate of incorporation, which requires comparable support to approve a transaction under certain circumstances involving K2 or any of K2s subsidiaries
and an interested stockholder or another business entity; and 



two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is required to materially change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A
Preferred Stock. 

Rawlings.

incorporation may be amended or repealed as permitted or prescribed by applicable law and approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote; however, any amendment not approved by two-thirds of the board must be approved by two-thirds of the
shares entitled to vote. In addition, Article Seven of the Rawlings certificate of incorporation, which provides for indemnification of directors for certain actions, cannot be amended or repealed to adversely affect any right or protection of a
director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date the amendment or repeal became effective.

OF K2 AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS



Amendments to Bylaws 

K2.
    The K2 bylaws may be amended by
the board of directors or at a stockholder meeting by the vote of 75% of the shares entitled to vote. 

Rawlings.
    The Rawlings bylaws may be amended by a majority of the board of directors. The stockholders may amend the bylaws without other action by the board of directors by a majority of the shares
entitled to vote at a stockholder meeting, if notice of such amendment was given in the notice for the meeting. Two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote must approve any amendment not approved by two-thirds of the board. 

Stockholder Action 

K2.
    The vote of a majority of the
shares present and entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting is the act of the K2 stockholders. The K2 restated certificate of incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected at a
duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by written consent. 

Rawlings
.    The vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting is the act of the Rawlings stockholders. However, any stockholder action, other than the
election of directors, which was not approval by two-thirds of the board, must be approved by two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote. Both the Rawlings certificate of incorporation and bylaws state that any action that may be taken by
stockholders must be taken at a duly called and held meeting and may not be taken by written consent. 

Notice of Certain Stockholder Actions 

K2.
    The K2 bylaws
state that a stockholder may only bring business before a stockholder meeting, including nominating directors for the board, if the stockholder gives at least ninety days advance written notice of the business to K2s Secretary or, if later,
the tenth day after the first public announcement of the date of the meeting. In addition, for business to be properly brought before any stockholder meeting, the matter must be a proper matter for stockholder action. 

Rawlings
.    The Rawlings bylaws state that a stockholder may only nominate directors for election or bring
business before a meeting of stockholders if the stockholder gives advance written notice of the nominations or business to the Secretary of Rawlings not less than sixty days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting. If, however, the date of the annual meeting is scheduled to be held either more than thirty days earlier than or sixty days after the date the annual meeting was held in the prior year, then the stockholder notice must be delivered no later
than the sixtieth day prior to the next annual meeting or the tenth day following the first public announcement of the date for such meeting. 

Special Stockholder Meetings 

Delaware General Corporation
Law
.    Under Delaware General Corporation Law, a special meeting of a corporations stockholders may be called by the board or by any other person authorized by the corporations certificate of incorporation or
bylaws. All stockholders of record entitled to vote must receive notice of all stockholder meetings not less than ten, nor more than sixty days before the date of the stockholder meeting. 

K2.

stockholders. No business may be transacted at a special meeting of the stockholders other than that stated in the notice of the meeting. 

Rawlings
.    The Rawlings bylaws provide that only the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the directors in office can call a special meeting of the stockholders. No business may be transacted
at a special meeting of the stockholders other than that stated in the notice of the meeting, unless all of the stockholders are present in

person or by proxy. Rawlings has received a proposal from a stockholder to be presented at the next annual meeting of Rawlings stockholders to amend Section 2.03 of the bylaws to permit a
holder of 15% or more of the outstanding Rawlings common stock to call a special meeting of the stockholders. 

Limitation of Personal Liability of Directors and Indemnification 

Delaware General
Corporation Law.
    Under Delaware General Corporation Law a corporation may include a provision in its certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its
stockholders for certain monetary damages resulting from breaches of fiduciary duties. Specifically, the corporation may indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation for expenses, monetary damages, fines and settlement
amounts to the extent the person: 



acted in good faith, 



acted in a manner he or she believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and 



with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. 

However, no provision can eliminate or limit director liability for any: 



breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, 



act or omission not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, 



violation of Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions,



transaction from which the director received any improper personal benefit, or 



act or omission that took place before the date of adoption of the provision in the certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the liability of a
director for breaches of fiduciary duties. 

Indemnification is also not permitted if the person is held liable to the
corporation or its stockholders, except to the extent that an appropriate court concludes that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for those expenses that the court deems proper. 

K2.
    The K2 restated certificate of incorporation provides a right to indemnification of current and former
directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, as described above. However, if the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to further eliminate or limit director liability, then the
indemnification provided shall be expanded to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as amended. In addition, the K2 restated certificate of incorporation requires K2 to indemnify any present or former director or
officer who has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any claim or proceeding for expenses, including attorneys fees. The K2 restated certificate of incorporation also permits K2s board of directors to provide
indemnification of employees and agents of K2 with the same scope and effect as the indemnification provided for directors and officers. This right to indemnification is not exclusive of any other right the director or officer may have.

Even if K2 is prohibited from indemnifying such person under Delaware General Corporation Law, it may maintain
insurance at the corporations expense to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent against such expense, liability or loss. 

Rawlings
.    The Rawlings certificate of incorporation provides a right to indemnification of current and former directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, as described above. However, if the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to further eliminate or limit director liability, then the indemnification provided shall be expanded to the fullest
extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as amended. In addition, the Rawlings board of directors may determine by resolution whether to indemnify an employee or agent of Rawlings.

OF K2 AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS



Mergers, Acquisitions and Other Transactions 

Delaware General Corporation
Law
.    Under Delaware General Corporation Law the board and a majority of the shares entitled to vote must approve a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of a corporations assets. However, unless
the corporation provides otherwise in its certificate of incorporation, no stockholder vote of a constituent corporation surviving a merger is required if: 



the merger agreement does not amend the constituent corporations certificate of incorporation, 



each share of stock of the constituent corporation outstanding before the merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share of the surviving corporation
after the merger, and 



either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are to be issued or delivered by way of the merger or, if common stock will be issued or
delivered, it will not increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock immediately before the merger by more than 20%. 

K2.
    K2s restated certificate of incorporation has two independent provisions regarding mergers and business combinations. Article Fourteen requires the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote to approve any merger or business combination involving K2. Article Fifteen requires approval by 80% of the shares entitled to vote for any merger or business combination
involving K2 or any of its subsidiaries and another corporation or an interested stockholder. This second group of transactions must also be approved by two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote other than those held by the interested stockholder in
question, if an interested stockholder is involved. Regardless, if the transaction involving another corporation or an interested stockholder is approved by two-thirds of the disinterested directors or several other conditions are met, then the
supermajority provision of Article Fifteen no longer applies. 

Rawlings.
    A
majority of the shares entitled to vote must approve any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of Rawlings assets. However, the Rawlings certificate of incorporation states that two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote must
approve any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of Rawlings assets if less than two-thirds of the board approved the transaction. Otherwise, holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote may approve the transaction.

Dissenters Appraisal Rights 

Delaware General Corporation
Law
.    Under Delaware General Corporation Law dissenters appraisal rights are available to a corporations stockholders in connection with certain mergers and consolidations. However, no rights are available in
certain situations. A corporations stockholders will not receive such rights if the corporation is the surviving corporation and no stockholder vote is required for the merger. Also, no such rights are available if the corporations stock
is either: 



listed on a national securities exchange, designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., or 



held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders. 

However, dissenters appraisal rights will be available if the merger or consolidation requires stockholders to exchange their stock for anything other than: 



shares of the surviving corporation, 



shares of another corporation that will be listed on a national securities exchange, designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, or 



cash in place of fractional shares. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

OF K2
AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS



K2
.    Because all of the above tests are satisfied,
K2 stockholders will not receive dissenters appraisal rights with respect to the merger. 

Rawlings
.    Because all of the above tests are satisfied, Rawlings stockholders will not receive dissenters appraisal rights with respect to the merger. 

Rights Plan 

Generally.
    K2 and Rawlings both
maintain stockholder rights plans which are designed to protect stockholders from attempts to acquire control of the company without the approval of the companys board and prevent abusive tactics from potential acquirers that do not treat all
stockholders fairly. 

The rights issued under each of the plans are not currently exercisable or transferable, and
no separate certificates evidencing such rights will be distributed, unless certain events, described below, occur. Although neither K2 nor Rawlings intended the rights plans to prevent a takeover of either company, the plans may cause substantial
dilution to certain persons or groups that beneficially acquire 15% or more of the respective companys common stock, unless the rights issuable under the plan are first redeemed by the respective board of directors. A summary of the key
provisions of the plans is provided below.

K2.
    K2 entered into a Rights
Agreement dated as of July 1, 1999 between K2 and Harris Trust Company of California. Pursuant to the rights agreement, a right is attached to each share of K2 common stock outstanding as of September 5, 1999. The rights become exercisable ten days
after the public announcement that any person or group has: 



acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares of K2 common stock, or 



initiated a tender offer for shares of K2 common stock, which would result in any person or group acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of K2 common
stock. 

Each right entitles its holder to purchase 

/

th of a share of K2 Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock at a price of $60 per 

/

th of a share of preferred stock. Once exercisable, each right will entitle its holder to purchase a number of
shares of K2 common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. At any time after any person or group becomes a 15% beneficial owner of K2 common stock but before a change in control transaction, the K2 board of
directors may exchange each right not owned by a 15% beneficial owner for one share of K2 common stock or other K2 preferred stock with rights similar to those of the Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.

In addition, each right, other than rights owned by the acquiring person, such persons
affiliates, associates and any group of which such person is a member, will entitle the holder of such rights to purchase a number of shares of the common stock of the acquiring entity or its parent having a market value equal to two times the
exercise price of the right, unless the rights are earlier redeemed by K2, after: 



a person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of K2 common stock, 



K2 is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or 



50% or more of K2s consolidated assets or earning power are sold. 

K2 may redeem the rights, at a price of $0.001 per right at any time prior to the close of business on the tenth day after a person or group obtains 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of K2s common stock. The rights expire on September 5, 2009, unless extended or earlier redeemed. 

Rawlings
.    Rawlings entered into a Rights Agreement dated as of November 27, 2002 between Rawlings and Mellon Investor Services LLC. The Rawlings rights plan was designed specifically to provide the
Rawlings board of directors with sufficient time, flexibility and negotiating leverage to adequately evaluate strategic

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

OF K2 AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS



alternatives in an orderly manner, including the merger proposal, as well as to ensure equal and fair treatment of Rawlings stockholders. Pursuant to the rights agreement, the Rawlings
board of directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase 

/

th of a share of Series B Preferred Stock
for each share of Rawlings common stock outstanding as of December 9, 2002. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase 

/

th of a share of Series B Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $30, subject to adjustment. 

The rights become exercisable upon the earlier of ten days after a person or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock
or ten business days after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer for shares of Rawlings common stock, which if completed, would result in any person or group acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common
stock. Rawlings has amended its rights agreement so that it will not apply to the Rawlings/K2 merger. In addition, the Rawlings rights plan includes a permitted offer exception for a tender offer or exchange offer which meets certain
criteria including, but not limited to, the following: 



the offer is for all outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock and remains open for at least sixty calendar days,



the consideration offered is cash or a publicly traded security, and 



the offer has been determined to be fair from a financial point of view by a nationally recognized investment banking firm.

Once the rights are exercisable, unless earlier redeemed by Rawlings in accordance with the rights
agreement, each right, other than rights owned by the acquiring person, such persons affiliates, associates and any group of which such person is a member, will entitle its holder to purchase a number of shares of Rawlings common stock having
the market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right for a period of sixty days. However, at the option of the Rawlings board of directors, until such time as an acquiring stockholder owns 50% or more of the outstanding Rawlings
common stock, Rawlings may exchange each right for one share of Rawlings common stock. 

In addition, each right,
other than rights owned by the acquiring person, such persons affiliates or associates or any group of which such person is a member, will entitle its holder to purchase a number of shares of the acquiring entitys common stock having a
market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right, unless the rights are earlier redeemed by Rawlings in accordance with the terms of the rights agreement, after: 



a person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock; 



Rawlings is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction; or 



50% or more of Rawlings assets or earning power are sold or transferred. 

Rawlings may redeem the rights at a price of $0.01 per right, payable in cash or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Rawlings board of directors, at any time
prior to the close of business on the tenth day after a person or group obtains 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Rawlings common stock. The rights expire on December 9, 2012, unless extended or earlier redeemed. 

The Rawlings rights plan includes a provision under which a committee of the Rawlings board of directors composed solely of independent
and disinterested directors is required to review the rights plan periodically in order to consider whether the maintenance of the rights plan continues to be in the best interests of Rawlings and its stockholders.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Legal Matters 

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to K2, will pass upon the
validity of the K2 common stock to be issued in connection with the merger. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP, counsel to Rawlings, are expected to render opinions concerning the federal income tax consequences of the
merger. 

Experts 

The consolidated financial statements of K2 and subsidiaries at December 31,
2001 and 2000, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, incorporated in the joint proxy statement of K2, which is referred to and made a part of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement, have
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, as set forth in their report, which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement, in reliance upon such report given on the
authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing. 

The consolidated financial statements of Rawlings
and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2002, and for the year ended August 31, 2002, have been included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus herein in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP, independent accountants, as set forth in their report
thereon appearing elsewhere in this document and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. 

Although Rawlings dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as its independent public accountants effective June 13, 2002 and has engaged KPMG LLP, the consolidated financial statements of Rawlings at August 31, 2001 and for each of the two
years in the period ended August 31, 2001 included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP. We have not been able to obtain, after reasonable efforts, the written consent of Arthur Andersen LLP to our naming
it as an expert and including its audit report for the financial statements of Rawlings at August 31, 2001 and for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2001 in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The requirement to obtain such
consent has been dispensed with in reliance on Rule 437a under the Securities Act of 1933. Because Arthur Andersen LLP has not consented to the inclusion of its report in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you will not be able to recover against
Arthur Andersen LLP under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP or any omissions to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The pro forma financial information presented below is derived from historical consolidated financial statements of K2 Inc. and Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc.
K2s merger with Rawlings will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded at their fair values as of the date of the merger. The pro forma adjustments
are based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price. For purposes of the pro forma presentation, the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is reflected as goodwill. A separate
determination will be made whether an intangible asset has been acquired that should be recognized apart from goodwill. K2s fiscal year ends on December 31. Rawlings fiscal year ends on August 31. Following the merger, K2 intends to change
Rawlings fiscal year to December 31 of each year. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet
gives effect to the merger of K2 as if it occurred as of September 30, 2002 and combines the unaudited condensed balance sheet of K2 as of September 30, 2002 and the unaudited condensed balance sheet of Rawlings as of August 31, 2002. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects the issuance of K2 shares of common stock in exchange for shares of Rawlings common stock as proposed in the merger agreement. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 combines the historical results for K2 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the historical results for Rawlings for the year ended November 30, 2001, as if the merger had occurred on January 1,
2001. 

For the year ended November 30, 2001, Rawlings historical income statement is a compilation of the three
months ended November 30, 2001 unaudited income statement from the Rawlings Form 10-Q as of that date, added to the year ended August 31, 2001 audited income statement from the Rawlings Form 10-K as of that date, less the three months ended November
30, 2000 unaudited income statement from the Rawlings Form 10-Q as of that date. 

The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 combines the historical results for K2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and the historical results for Rawlings for the nine months ended August 31,
2002 as if the merger of K2 and Rawlings had occurred on January 1, 2001 and reflects the issuance of K2 shares of common stock in exchange for shares of Rawlings common stock as proposed in the merger agreement. 

The unaudited pro forma financial information presented is based on the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
The unaudited pro forma statement of operations does not purport to represent what K2s results of operations actually would have been if the events described above had occurred as of the dates indicated or what such results would be for any
future periods. The unaudited pro forma financial statements are based upon assumptions and adjustments that we believe are reasonable. Assumptions regarding the value of K2 common stock and the resulting number of shares of K2 common stock to be
issued in connection with the merger are based on the last reported sale price of the K2 common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 8, 2003 and may be materially different from the value of K2 common stock at the time the merger is
completed. The unaudited pro forma financial statements, and the accompanying notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes of K2 and Rawlings included in the applicable companys annual report
on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference or included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED 

COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 



K2 AND RAWLINGS 

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

(All amounts in thousands except per share data) 

(Unaudited) 

Basis of Presentation 

The pro forma condensed combined financial statements included herein have been prepared by K2, without audit, under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some information and footnote disclosures
normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted under these rules and regulations. However, K2 and Rawlings believe that
the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

The preparation of unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Pro Forma Income (Loss) Per Share 

The pro forma combined net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock of K2 outstanding and the dilutive impact of K2 stock
options outstanding, with additional shares of K2 common stock presumed issued at the beginning of the period presented based upon the assumed exchange ratio of 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock for each share of Rawlings stock outstanding.

Merger Related Expenses of K2 and Rawlings 

K2 and Rawlings estimate that they will incur merger-related expenses, consisting primarily of transaction costs for investment banker fees, attorneys, accountants,
financial printing, proxy solicitation fees and other related charges, of approximately $5,200. This estimate is preliminary and is therefore subject to change. These nonrecurring costs are added to the purchase price of the acquisition and
considered in the calculation of goodwill.

Other Events 

Under the terms of the K2 and Rawlings existing credit agreements, the companies must obtain the approval of its respective senior creditors in order to complete the
proposed merger. K2 has, however, entered into a process to replace the combined companys existing senior debt with a new series of junior subordinated debentures and a credit facility as described more fully below. It is the intention of K2
to complete the refinancing prior to the completion of the merger. Since the completion of this refinancing is not a condition to completing the merger however, the proforma financial statements do not reflect the impact of this refinancing.

On December 10, 2002, K2 signed a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which K2 has the right, and the
obligation under specified circumstances, to issue $25,000 of its convertible subordinated debentures due March, 2010, with a coupon rate of 7.25% per annum. The debentures are convertible into 2,097 shares of K2 common stock at a conversion price
of $11.92 per share. Additionally, warrants to purchase 524 shares of K2 common stock at an exercise price of $13.91 per share will also be issued. K2 has also entered into a non-binding letter of intent with a bank for a new secured, revolving
credit facility that will provide for aggregate borrowings by K2 of up to $160,000. K2 intends to increase the facility to $225,000 to accommodate the working

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED

(Unaudited) 

capital requirements of Rawlings. The proposed credit facility will have a term of three years, and amounts borrowed under the proposed credit facility will be secured by all of the assets of K2
and its domestic subsidiaries, including the assets of Rawlings following the merger, as well as the stock of certain of K2s foreign subsidiaries. 

The impact of the refinancing on the capitalization of the combined companies as of September 30, 2002 would be to replace K2s and Rawlings existing outstanding bank loans of $34,797,
current portion of long term debt of $8,798 and long term debt of $83,819 with the $25,000 proceeds from the convertible subordinated debentures and with $102,414 from the secured, revolving credit facility described above. Additionally, the fair
market value of the warrants as calculated using the Black-Scholes method will be considered in the total estimated deferred financing costs of $4,900 replacing the existing net unamortized deferred financing costs of $2,500. The actual impact of
the refinancing may differ at the time the merger is completed. 

Adjustments to Pro Forma Statements 

(1)

Reflects adjustments to assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, adjustments to eliminate the historical Rawlings stockholder equity
accounts, adjustments to record the issuance of K2 stock and stock options and accrue for the related merger costs under the purchase method of accounting. The allocation of the aggregate purchase cost below is preliminary. The preliminary
allocation assumes that the excess purchase price will be allocated to goodwill, and is thus not amortized, however the final allocation could include identifiable intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives separate from goodwill. Should
there be assets with definite lives, those assets would be subject to amortization resulting in additional amortization expense. The final allocation will be based on estimates and appraisals that will be completed after the mergers completion
and managements final evaluation of such assets and liabilities. The final allocation of purchase cost and the resulting effect on net income or loss may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts included herein.

The purchase price assumes a $9.65 share price for K2 common stock at the time of the merger. This assumption is based on the last reported sale price of K2
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 8, 2003. The actual value of the K2 common stock may be materially different at the time the merger is completed. The number of shares issued assumes an average daily closing price for K2 common
stock of between $9.47 per share and $10.53 per share, which represents the floor and ceiling price within which the exchange ratio is fixed. If the average daily closing price of K2 common stock for the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on
and including the second day preceding the closing date is less than $9.47 per share, the exchange ratio will be adjusted upward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock having a
value of $9.00 per share of Rawlings stock exchanged based on the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during the specified period. If the average daily closing price of K2 common stock exceeds $10.53 per share, the

exchange ratio will be adjusted downward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock having a value of $10.00 per share of
Rawlings stock exchanged based on the average daily closing price of K2 common stock during the specified period. 

The preliminary estimate of K2 shares and stock options issued is based on the number of shares of common stock of Rawlings outstanding at the time of the
merger, as well as Rawlings stock options outstanding, which will become fully vested and immediately exercisable at the time of the merger. 

The adjustment to stockholders equity is based on the pro forma capitalization of K2 as follows:

Black-Scholes estimate based on the following assumptions: (1) Risk free interest rate of 2.75%, (2) Volatility of K2 stock of 0.641 and (3) Expected life

(2)

Pro forma adjustment reflects elimination of Rawlings historical stockholders equity accounts when shares of K2 common stock and stock options are issued
upon completion of the merger. 

(3)

Preliminary pro forma adjustments were made to adjust Rawlings assets and liabilities to fair market value at August 31, 2002. The adjustments consisted
of (a) increasing inventories by $3,000 to reflect the inventory at its fair market value, net of costs of disposal and a reasonable profit for the remaining selling effort; (b) an adjustment of $1,200 consisting of the write-off of $800 of
capitalized debt costs, to reflect the debt to be assumed at its fair value which is the amount expected to pay off the Rawlings debt in connection with the merger and a $400 adjustment to reflect certain other assets at their estimated fair value;
and (c) the recording of $4,300 in accrued liabilities for certain estimated other restructuring costs related to Rawlings in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue Number 95-3 that will be affected by the completion of the merger.

The increase to inventory values will result in cost of goods sold being higher when the related inventories are sold in future periods after the merger is
completed. 

Of the pro forma adjustment of $4,300 to accrued liabilities for certain estimated other restructuring costs discussed above, $3,000 represents the accrual of
severance payments to twenty-five of Rawlings employees which could be triggered by certain actions taken by K2 after the merger.

No pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect any cost savings that could be realized as the result of the merger of the two companies. 

(4)

Rawlings non-current deferred taxes were reduced by a pro forma adjustment of $5,696 to reflect a limitation in the value of the remaining net operating loss
carryforward as of August 31, 2002 as the result of the merger with K2. In addition, as a result of the non-current deferred tax asset carried by Rawlings at August 31, 2002, the non-current deferred tax liability of K2 at September 30, 2002 of
$7,588 was reclassified from a liability to a reduction of the non-current asset. 

(5)

Pro forma adjustments were made to the number of basic and diluted shares outstanding based on the preliminary number of shares of K2 common stock and stock
options (under the treasury stock method) that are expected to be issued in connection with the merger, based on the number of Rawlings shares of common stock and stock options outstanding and assuming an exchange ratio of 0.950 of a share of K2
stock for each Rawlings share.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

To the Stockholders of Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc.: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2002 and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. as of August 31, 2001 and for the years ended August 31, 2001 and August 31, 2000, were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report dated October 25, 2001.

RAWLINGS SPORTING GOODS COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Amounts in thousands, except share and
per share data) 

NOTE 1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Business 

Rawlings manufactures and distributes an extensive line of sports equipment and uniforms for team sports such as baseball, basketball and football predominately in the United States. 

Inventories 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out method. Cost includes materials and conversion costs. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The principal estimated useful lives are as follows: 

Buildings and improvements

20-30 years

Machinery and equipment

5-12 years

Other

4-10 years

When equipment is sold or retired, its cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss is included in income during the period of the disposition. Repair and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. 

Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets, primarily
property plant and equipment, are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the expected future undiscounted cash flows before consideration of income taxes. If an impairment has occurred on assets held
for use, the loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Long-lived assets that are to be disposed are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue from product sales, including shipping fees, is reported net of returns and sales allowances. Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is typically when the product is shipped.

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach known as the liability method. The liability method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying the statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance
sheet to the differences between the book basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

(Amounts in
thousands, except share and per share data) 

Translation of Foreign Currencies 

The assets and liabilities of foreign branches and subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and profit and
loss accounts are translated at average annual exchange rates. Resulting translation gains and losses are included in Cumulative Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component in Stockholders Equity. Foreign exchange transaction losses of $2,
$26 and $0 were included in the results of operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 

Financial Instruments 

The fair value of the Companys financial instruments
approximates their carrying amounts. The Companys debt is primarily variable in nature and accordingly the fair value approximates the carrying value. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and provides the pro forma disclosures of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. 

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss) or total stockholders
equity. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations. The new standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its
present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial position. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 143 in fiscal 2003. 

F-9 



RAWLINGS SPORTING GOODS COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

(Amounts in
thousands, except share and per share data) 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The new standard replaces FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The primary
objectives of this statement were to develop one accounting model, based on the framework established in Statement 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues. Statement 144 requires that all
long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. The standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial position. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 144 in fiscal 2003. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires that
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to impact our consolidation financial position. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 146 in fiscal 2003. 

NOTE 2.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

On
June 26, 2000 the Company made a strategic decision to seek a buyer for its Vic hockey business. Vic provided an extensive line of equipment for hockey teams including hockey sticks, hockey protective equipment and goalie protective equipment. The
sale of the Vic hockey business was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 under substantially the same terms as originally provided. Proceeds from the sale totaled $2,551 including cash of $1,474 at closing and $1,077 of 7% notes to be
received through April 2004 which are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This asset is secured by a building and the Vic trademark. 

Operating results for the hockey business are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as net loss from discontinued operations through May 31, 2000. Operating results subsequent to May 31,
2000 are included in the provision for operating losses during the phase-out period that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. Results for the discontinued operations are as follows:

The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realizable. As of August 31, 2002, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $2,146 related to a capital loss carry forward that expires in 2006 generated from
the sale of the

F-12

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)

hockey business. The valuation allowance decreased (increased) by $369, $538, and ($1,807) during 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The valuation allowance provision of $1,807 recorded in 2000
was reflected through discontinued operations. In order to recognize the aforementioned deferred tax asset, the Company would need to generate approximately $76,000 of pretax income. 

The Companys net operating loss carry-forward deferred tax asset of $9,780 as of August 31, 2002 expires from 2019 to 2021. Income taxes have not been provided on the
undistributed income (approximately $8,857 as of August 31, 2002) for a foreign subsidiary, which the Company does not intend to be remitted to the U.S. 

In July 1994, Figgie International, Inc. (the former parent, presently a subsidiary of Tyco International) transferred the net assets of the Rawlings business to the Company. The assets and liabilities
transferred to Rawlings were recorded at the predecessors cost for financial reporting purposes. For tax purposes, the transaction resulted in a step-up of the basis of the assets transferred determined by the fair value paid by the Company
for the Rawlings business. The tax-effected book versus tax difference related to the tax step-up is recorded as a deferred tax asset titled asset step-up in the above table as of August 31, 2002 and 2001. Under the terms of a tax sharing and
separation agreement between the Company and the former parent, the Company was required to pay the former parent 43% of the tax benefits resulting from the step-up in the tax basis of the assets as the benefit of the step-up was realized. The
Company executed an agreement with Tyco International to terminate the tax sharing agreement in return for a $1,000 payment from Rawlings to Tyco, payable in two equal $500 installments in November 2002 and May 2003. The settlement is included in
Accrued Liabilities on the August 31, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the obligation that was not expected to be paid in 2002 ($9,291) was recorded and titled as Other Long-term Liabilities on the August 31, 2001 Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The Company recorded the difference between the amount expected to be paid under the tax sharing and separation agreement of $9,291 and the settlement amount of $1,000 as an increase in Stockholders Equity (APIC) of $8,291.

On December 28, 1999, the Company refinanced its credit facility by
entering into a five-year credit agreement expiring December 1, 2004 with a financial institution. Actual availability is based on the Companys outstanding receivables and inventories. Total unused availability under the credit facility at
August 31, 2002 was approximately $7,198. The facility also allows for a $2,000 seasonal advance from August 2002 through February 2003. On November 14, 2002 the Company and its lenders amended the credit agreement to increase the seasonal advance
to $5,000 for the period from November 2002 through January 2003. Borrowings under the agreement are based on an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. A commitment fee of 0.50% is charged on any unused portion of the facility. 

The credit facility includes various covenants, including requirements that the Company achieve certain EBITDA levels as defined in the
agreement, maintain a fixed charge ratio, limit capital expenditures and restrict the payment of dividends. EBITDA and fixed charge ratio for the twelve months ended August 31, 2002 were $9,386 and 1.44, respectively. The covenants for EBITDA and
fixed charge ratio for that period were $9,000 and 1.15, respectively. The EBITDA requirement increases $125 for each of the fiscal 2003 quarter-end compliance calculations that are based on a rolling four quarters of EBITDA resulting in a $9,500
requirement for the twelve months ending August 31, 2003. The covenant for fixed charge ratio for each quarter-end calculation in fiscal 2003 is 1.20. As of August 31, 2002, the Company is in compliance with the debt covenants related to the credit
facility. The Company believes its capital structure and current credit facility are adequate to provide for its short term and long term operations to the extent that the Company is able to satisfy the EBITDA and other convenants set forth in the
credit facility. 

In accordance with EITF 95-22 Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under
Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement, the Company has classified the revolving credit facility as a current obligation. 

The extraordinary item of $646 recorded in fiscal 2000 was due to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of the previous
credit facility. 

The Companys principal debt maturities on its term debt for the three years subsequent to
August 31, 2002 are $1,302, $1,302 and $1,639, respectively.

At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 15, 2001, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
represented at the meeting voted against the retention of the Companys Rights Agreement, dated July 1, 1994. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the redemption of the rights and the termination of the Rights Agreement
effective December 31, 2001. 

All rights holders of record as of December 31, 2001 were entitled to redemption

NOTE 11.    UNUSUAL EXPENSE 

2001 Unusual Expense 

In connection with the relocation of distribution facilities to a new
single location in Washington, Missouri, the Springfield, Missouri distribution center was sold in September 2000. The move to Washington was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Transition and facility clean up costs incurred during the
move to Washington of $1,527, offset by the gain on the sale of Springfield of $1,115, have been included as unusual expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income in fiscal 2001. 

2000 Unusual Expense 

During the first quarter of 2000, the
Company completed a voluntary early retirement program for certain of its employees. The cost of the program totaled approximately $759 and was substantially paid out as of August 31, 2000. The costs primarily related to severance and medical
benefits. Additionally, during the first half of 2000, the Company completed a review of its strategic alternatives that cost approximately $738. 

NOTE 12.    EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

Company-Sponsored Defined Contribution Plans

Substantially all U.S. salaried employees and certain U.S. hourly employees are covered by a defined
contribution (Section 401(k)) plan that provides funding based on a percentage of compensation. The Companys contributions to the plan were $288, $286 and $303 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 

Multi-Employer Pension Plans 

Certain union employees participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Contributions to the plans were $21, $38 and $65 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 

NOTE 13.    STOCK OPTIONS 

The 1994 Rawlings Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the 1994 Incentive Plan), provides for the issuance of up to 1,125,000 shares of Rawlings common stock upon the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and as
restricted stock, deferred stock, stock granted as a bonus or in lieu of other awards and other equity-based awards. The 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the 1994 Directors Stock Plan), as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 250,000
shares of Rawlings common stock to non-employee directors upon the exercise of stock options or in lieu of directors fees. The 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock

Plan (the 2000 Directors Stock Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 25,000 shares of Rawlings common stock to non-employee directors upon exercise of stock options or in lieu of
directors fees. The Employment Agreement by and between Rawlings and Stephen M. OHara, Chief Executive Officer (the Employment Agreement), provides for the issuance of up to 450,000 shares of Rawlings common stock upon exercise of stock
options. 

Stock options granted under the 1994 Incentive Plan, the 1994 Directors Stock Plan and the 2000
Directors Stock Plan have exercise prices equal to the market price on the date of grant, primarily vest over three to four years from the date of grant and, once vested, are generally exercisable over ten years following the date of grant.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in 2002, 2001, and 2000 consistent with the provisions of this statement, the Companys net income and net income per share would have been as follows:

NOTE 14.    WARRANTS 

In November 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 925,804 shares of common stock at $12.00 per share to Bull Run Corporation for
$3.07 per warrant. These warrants expired unexercisable on November 21, 2001 and accordingly, these warrants were not included in the Companys earnings per share calculation. One half of the purchase price of the warrants was paid in cash with
the other half payable with interest at 7% at the expiration of the warrants. The receivable of $1,421 plus interest was paid by Bull Run Corporation during fiscal 2002. The receivable for the unpaid portion of the warrants at August 31, 2001 is
classified as a stock subscription receivable in the accompanying balance sheet.

The Company has conducted environmental investigation and remediation
activities at its Dolgeville, New York facility (the Site) with respect to the release of wood pitch into surrounding soil and surface water. In November 1997, the Company entered into a Voluntary Agreement with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (the NYSDEC) to conduct certain environmental remediation activities related to the presence of wood pitch in the soils at the Site. The wood pitch was generated as a result of the operation,
before Rawlings ownership of the Site, of a retort facility by a third party unrelated to Rawlings. 

During
October 2000, the Company completed the excavation and removal of the wood pitch. Based on reports from legal counsel and environmental engineers, NYSDEC has accepted the final technical report memorializing the excavation and off-site disposal of
the wood pitch impacted soil and the subsequent groundwater monitoring and no further remedial work on the Site is necessary. The Company does not anticipate incurring any future expense related to this item.

NOTE 17.    OPERATING SEGMENTS 

Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by
the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has identified operating segments based on internal management reports. Aggregation of similar operating segments into a single
reportable operating segment is permitted if the businesses are considered to have similar long-term economic characteristics. The Company has four operating segments based on its product categories, which in applying the aggregation criteria, have
been aggregated into two reportable segments: Sports Equipment and Licensing.

The sports equipment segment manufactures and distributes sports
equipment and uniforms for team sports including baseball, basketball, and football. The licensing segment licenses the Rawlings brand name on products sold by other companies and includes products such as footwear and activewear. There are no
significant determinable operating expenses or interest costs for the licensing segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 for the Company. The revenues generated and long-lived assets located outside
the United States are not significant for separate presentation. One customers (Wal-mart) purchases of products sold by Rawlings were 17%, 17% and 15% of net revenues of Rawlings for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Note 1:    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission pertaining to interim financial information and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2002 filed on November 27, 2002. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations have been included therein. The results for the three months ended November 30, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for a full fiscal year. 

Note 2:    Effect of New Accounting Standards

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Accounting Standards No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144, which supersedes SFAS 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, provides for a single accounting model for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The main objective of this Statement is to resolve implementation issues related to SFAS 121 by clarifying certain of its provisions. This Statement was adopted by the Company effective September 1, 2002.

Note 4:    Long-Term Receivables 

On January 22, 2002 Kmart Corporation filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of the date of the
bankruptcy filing, the Company had accounts receivable from Kmart of $1,213,000. Of this amount, $667,000 less an allowance for doubtful accounts of $250,000 is included in Long-term Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining
$546,000 is included in Accounts Receivable with a corresponding amount in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net receivable of $417,000 represents the Companys best estimate of recovery on pre-petition
Kmart receivables. 

Note 5:    Discontinued Segment 

On June 26, 2000 the Company made a strategic decision to seek a buyer for its Vic hockey business. Vic provided an extensive line of equipment for hockey teams including
hockey sticks, hockey protective equipment and goalie protective equipment. The sale of the Vic hockey business was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 under substantially the same terms as originally provided. Proceeds from the sale
totaled $2,551,000

including cash of $1,474,000 at closing and $1,077,000 of 7% notes to be received through April 2004 which are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This asset is secured by
the Vic trademark. The Company is currently renegotiating the note. 

Note 6:    Debt 

On December 28, 1999, the Company refinanced its credit facility by entering into a five-year credit agreement expiring December 1, 2004
with a financial institution. Actual availability is based on the Companys outstanding receivables and inventories. The facility also allows for a $2,000,000 seasonal advance from August 2002 through February 2003. Borrowings under the
agreement are based on an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. A commitment fee of 0.50% is charged on any unused portion of the facility. On November 14, 2002 the Company and its lenders amended the credit agreement to increase the seasonal
advance to $5,000,000 for the period from November 2002 through January 2003. The Company and its lenders also amended the credit agreement on December 11, 2002 to permit the Company to enter into a Single Customer Credit Approved Receivables
Purchasing Agreement (SCARPA) with The CIT Group Commercial Services, Inc. to protect post-petition receivables from Kmart. 

The credit facility includes various covenants, including requirements that the Company achieve certain EBITDA levels as defined in the agreement, maintain a fixed charge ratio, limit capital expenditures and restrict the payment of
dividends. The covenants for EBITDA and fixed charge ratio for the twelve months ended November 30, 2002 were $9,125,000 and 1.20, respectively. Actual EBITDA and fixed charge ratio for the same period were $9,529,000 and 1.58, respectively. The
EBITDA requirement increases $125,000 for each of the fiscal 2003 quarter-end compliance calculations that are based on a rolling four quarters of EBITDA resulting in a $9,500,000 requirement for the twelve months ending August 31, 2003. The
covenant for fixed charge ratio for each quarter-end calculation in fiscal 2003 is 1.20. As of November 30, 2002, the Company is in compliance with the debt covenants related to the credit facility. Total unused availability under the credit
facility at November 30, 2002 was approximately $3,445,000. The Company believes its capital structure and current credit facility are adequate to provide for its short term and long term operations to the extent that the Company is able to satisfy
the EBITDA and other covenants set forth in the credit facility. 

Note 7:    Comprehensive Loss 

For the three months ended November 30, 2002 and November 30, 2001 comprehensive loss was $721,000 and $855,000, respectively.

Note 8:    Operating Segments 

Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has identified operating segments based on internal management reports. Aggregation of similar operating segments into a single reportable operating segment is permitted
if the businesses are considered to have similar long-term economic characteristics. The Company has four operating segments based on its product categories, which in applying the aggregation criteria have been aggregated into two reportable
segments: Sports Equipment and Licensing. 

The sports equipment segment manufactures and distributes sports
equipment and uniforms for team sports including baseball, basketball and football. The licensing segment licenses the Rawlings brand name on products sold by other companies and includes products such as footwear and activewear. There are no
significant

Licensing revenues were $1,100,000 in the quarter ended November
30, 2002 which was $74,000 or 6.3% below the comparable prior year period. This reduction was primarily due to lower revenues from the Companys footwear licensee and backyard games licensee partially offset by higher revenues from Asics, the
Companys Japanese licensee. 

Note 9:    Subsequent Event 

On December 16, 2002, Rawlings and K2 Inc. announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Rawlings will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 Inc. in a stock-for-stock merger. Under terms of the agreement, each share of Rawlings common stock will be converted into 0.950 of a share of K2 common stock, subject to a collar mechanism. If the average closing price
of K2 common stock for the 15 trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date (the Average Closing Price) exceeds $10.53 per share, the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward to an exchange ratio that will result in
Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock (based on the Average Closing Price of K2 common stock) having a value of $10.00 per share. If the Average Closing Price of K2 common stock is less than $9.47 per share, the
exchange ratio will be adjusted upward to an exchange ratio that will result in Rawlings stockholders receiving a number of shares of K2 common stock (based on the Average Closing Price of K2 common stock) having a value of $9.00 per share. If the
merger is not completed, Rawlings under certain circumstances could be required to pay K2 Inc. a termination fee of $2,900,000. K2 Inc. has agreed, upon completion of the merger, to reimburse Rawlings for $163,000 of merger related expenses incurred
in the quarter ended November 30, 2002. The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2003. K2 Inc. is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of brand-name sporting goods, recreational and industrial products.

S
ECTION
 1.10.    
Exchange of Certificates
. 

(a)    Prior to the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b) and (c) below, Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected by Parent
and Acquisition and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the 
Exchange Agent
) for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article 1: (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8, and (ii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the 
Exchange
Fund
), in exchange for outstanding Shares. 

(b)    Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the 
Certificates
) and whose shares were converted into the
right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.10. 

(c)    No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 1.10(f), until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.10(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender
