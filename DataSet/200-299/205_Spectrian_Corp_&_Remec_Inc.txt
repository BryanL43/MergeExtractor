Dear Shareholders of REMEC, Inc. and Stockholders of Spectrian Corporation. 

A MERGER PROPOSALYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT  

        The boards of directors of REMEC and Spectrian have unanimously agreed to a merger in which Spectrian will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC. Upon the
closing of the proposed merger, two members of the Spectrian board of directors will join the REMEC board of directors. Ronald E. Ragland will remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of REMEC and
Thomas H. Waechter, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Spectrian, will become the President and Chief Operating Officer of REMEC. 

        REMEC
common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol "REMC" and on June 19, 2002, the closing price was $6.13 per share. 

        Upon
consummation of the merger, Spectrian stockholders will receive approximately $14.00 of REMEC common stock, subject to a collar, or, if REMEC chooses, a combination of REMEC common
stock and cash. REMEC has until [            ] to decide if it wants to pay some of the merger consideration in cash. If REMEC elects to pay cash, it may pay up to $4.00 per
share in cash. The remaining payment will be in REMEC common stock, which will be determined based on the average trading price of REMEC common stock for the ten-day period ending on the second
trading day before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. Spectrian stockholders will also receive cash for any fractional shares of REMEC common stock that they are entitled to receive in the
merger. For an explanation of what Spectrian stockholders may receive in the merger and the election and proration procedures, please see the sections titled "Summary of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus" beginning on page 1 and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 77. 

The boards of directors of both REMEC and Spectrian have unanimously approved the merger and recommend their respective shareholders and stockholders vote "FOR"
the merger and the other proposals set forth in the attached joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        The
attached joint proxy statement/prospectus provides detailed information concerning REMEC, Spectrian, the merger and proposals related to the merger. 
We urge
you to read it, including the section describing risk factors beginning on page 23.

Questions and Answers about the Merger  

About the Merger  

Q:
What will happen in the merger? (See page 77)

A:
In
the merger, Spectrian and a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC will merge and the resulting company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC. The merger agreement is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read it carefully.

Q:
What will I receive as a Spectrian stockholder? (See page 77 )

A:
Upon
consummation of the merger, Spectrian stockholders will receive approximately $14.00 of REMEC common stock, subject to the collar described below, or, if REMEC in its sole
discretion elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration with cash, a combination of shares of REMEC common stock and cash. If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash,
then Spectrian stockholders will be able to elect, subject to the proration and allocation provisions described in the merger agreement, to receive REMEC common stock, cash or a combination of stock
and cash. After the merger, Spectrian common stock will cease to trade. The number of shares of REMEC common stock that will be issued for each share of Spectrian common stock will depend on the
average trading price of REMEC common stock for a ten-day period ending on and including the second trading day before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, which is referred to
in this document as the average REMEC share price. If REMEC elects to pay only in shares of its common stock, Spectrian stockholders will receive between 1.3333 and 2.0 shares of REMEC common stock
for each share of Spectrian common stock they own, based on the average REMEC share price. Spectrian stockholders will receive cash for any fractional shares of REMEC common stock that they would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the merger.

Q:
How will I know if REMEC has elected to pay part of the merger consideration in cash? (See page 77)

A:
At
any time prior to [                        ], 2002 (five business days before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders),
REMEC may elect to pay a portion of the
merger consideration in cash. Once REMEC makes its decision, it will publicly announce it by:


issuing
a press release;


posting
the election on its web site; and


providing
the information at the following toll-free number: 1-800-[]. 

Q.
If I am a Spectrian stockholder, can I choose whether I receive REMEC common stock or cash? (See page 79)

A.
If,
and only if, REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, Spectrian stockholders may request that they receive for their shares of Spectrian common stock:


$14.00
per share in cash;


the
number of shares of REMEC common stock equal to the exchange ratio, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares; or


a
combination of cash and shares of REMEC common stock. 

Because
REMEC may elect to pay some of the consideration in cash as late as five business days before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, Spectrian stockholders are encouraged to submit an
election form and transmittal letter, which accompanies this joint proxy statement/ 

prospectus, promptly. Properly completed election forms must be received by [                        ], 2002 in order to be
considered. If REMEC does not elect to pay a portion of the
merger consideration in cash, no elections by Spectrian stockholders will be operative and election forms will be disregarded. 

Q.
What happens if more Spectrian stockholders elect to receive REMEC common stock than is available? (See page 81)

A.
If
REMEC elects to pay some of the merger consideration in cash, and more Spectrian stockholders elect to receive REMEC common stock for their shares of Spectrian common stock than is
available, then:


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders elected to receive cash will receive cash;


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders made no election will receive cash; and


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders elected to receive REMEC common stock will receive a pro rata amount of the REMEC
common stock and cash for the remaining shares of Spectrian common stock. The pro rata amount will be determined by dividing the maximum number of shares of Spectrian common stock entitled to receive
REMEC common stock by the total number of shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders have elected to receive REMEC common stock. The allocation will be made in such a manner as
to distribute all of the REMEC common stock available. No fractional shares will be issued and cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. 

Q.
What happens if more Spectrian stockholders elect to receive cash than is available? (See page 81)

A:
If
REMEC elects to pay some of the merger consideration in cash, and more Spectrian stockholders elect to receive cash for their shares of Spectrian common stock than is available,
then:


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders elected to receive REMEC common stock will receive REMEC common stock;


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders made no election will receive REMEC common stock; and


all
shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders elected to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of the cash and REMEC common
stock for their remaining shares of Spectrian common stock. The pro rata amount will be determined by dividing the maximum number of shares of Spectrian common stock entitled to receive cash by the
total number of shares of Spectrian common stock for which Spectrian stockholders have elected to receive cash. The allocation will be made in such a manner as to distribute all of the REMEC common
stock available. No fractional shares will be issued and cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. 

Q.
Do I need to submit the election form if my Spectrian shares are held in a brokerage account?

A.
Yes.
Your broker cannot make an election for you unless you complete and return an election form and transmittal letter. If you fail to do so, your shares will be classified as
undesignated shares. 

Q.
What happens if I do not submit an election form? (See page 82)

A.
If
you do not submit an election form, your election form is not received on time or there is some other defect in your election form, your shares of Spectrian common stock will be
classified as undesignated. You would receive REMEC common stock, cash or a combination thereof in proportions designed to provide Spectrian stockholders who made elections with their desired
election, subject to the maximum amount of REMEC common stock to be issued and the maximum amount of cash to be paid as merger consideration.

Q:
How can I find out the final exchange ratio? (See page 78)

A:
The
exchange ratio will be determined after The Nasdaq National Market closes on [                        ], 2002 (two business days
before the Spectrian special meeting
of stockholders). REMEC and Spectrian have established a toll free telephone number you can call beginning 10 days prior to the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders to find out what the

Q:
How will the merger affect options to acquire Spectrian common stock? (See page 83)

purchase shares of REMEC common stock after completion of the merger. The number of shares covered by these options will be adjusted based upon the exchange ratio. The applicable exercise price of
these options will be correspondingly adjusted. Holders of options will not be entitled to make an election to receive REMEC common stock or cash and will not be entitled to cash in lieu of fractional
shares with respect to their options.

Q:
What are the expected United States federal income tax consequences of the merger? (See page 72)

gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except that Spectrian stockholders will recognize gain, if any, with respect to the cash they receive in the
merger. In addition, Spectrian stockholders will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of REMEC common stock. 

Q:
How will the merger be accounted for? (See page 75)

A.
REMEC
intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial accounting purposes, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, the
assets and liabilities of REMEC will be carried forward at their recorded amount but the assets and liabilities of Spectrian will be recorded at fair value and the difference between the total
purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill on the books of REMEC. The results of operations and cash flows of Spectrian will be included in
REMEC's financial statements only from the date of the closing of the merger. Spectrian and REMEC's historical operating results will not be combined.

under the agreement, and Mr. Waechter must not have been terminated, resigned from or otherwise be unable to perform in his position as Spectrian's President and Chief Executive Officer. 

Q:
Does the merger agreement permit termination of the merger? (See page 94)

A.
Yes,
Spectrian and REMEC may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. Additionally, either Spectrian or REMEC may terminate the merger agreement
under any of the following circumstances:


if
the merger is not completed by November 15, 2002;


if
a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not appealable;


if
the Spectrian stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger;


if
the REMEC shareholders do not approve the merger proposal; or


if
the conditions to completion of the merger would not be satisfied because the other party breaches a representation or warranty in the merger agreement
which results in a material 

adverse
effect or fails to comply in all material respects with a covenant or agreement in the merger agreement. 

REMEC
may terminate the merger agreement if: 


Spectrian
or its representatives breach in any material respect their agreement not to solicit alternative proposals for a business combination with
Spectrian;


if
Spectrian breaches in any material respect its agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies of its stockholders to vote in
favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger at a special meeting of the Spectrian stockholders;


Spectrian's
board of directors withdraws or changes, in a manner adverse to REMEC, its recommendation in favor of the merger;


Spectrian's
board of directors approves or recommends any acquisition proposal from a party other than REMEC;


Spectrian
enters into any letter of intent or other agreement accepting any acquisition proposal from a party other than REMEC; or


a
tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of Spectrian is commenced by a person unaffiliated with REMEC, and Spectrian does not recommend that
its stockholders reject such offer within five business days after such offer is first made. 

Spectrian
may terminate the merger agreement if REMEC fails to use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies of its shareholders to vote in favor of the merger proposal at a special
meeting of the REMEC shareholders. 

Q:
Could Spectrian be required to pay a termination fee? (See page 95)

A.
Yes.
If the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, Spectrian will be required to pay to REMEC a termination fee of $6,000,000.

Q:
May Spectrian negotiate with other parties? (See page 88)

A.
No. Spectrian
has agreed, subject to limited exceptions for responses to unsolicited bona fide offers, not to initiate or engage in discussions with another party concerning a
business combination with a party other than REMEC while the merger is pending. Spectrian has agreed not to solicit, initiate, encourage or discuss any proposal for a business combination or other
similar transaction involving the acquisition or purchase of (1) more than 15% of any class of voting securities of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries or (2) the business or assets
that account for 15% or more of Spectrian's consolidated net revenues, net income or assets, or the liquidation or dissolution of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries that constitutes or accounts for
15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets, prior to completion of the merger unless the other party has made an unsolicited written proposal to Spectrian for a transaction
which the Spectrian board of directors believes in good faith, after consultation with Spectrian's financial advisor, that the potential acquirer has the financial wherewithal to be reasonably capable
of consummating the transaction and would, if consummated, be more favorable to the Spectrian stockholders than the merger with REMEC, and a number of other conditions are satisfied. The merger
agreement does not prevent the Spectrian board of directors from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and counsel, that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders. 

Q:
Are there restrictions on the ability to sell REMEC stock received as a result of the merger? (See page 98)

A.
All
REMEC common stock received by Spectrian stockholders in connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an affiliate of either REMEC or
Spectrian under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Shares of REMEC held by affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. Generally, an affiliate is considered to be someone who is an executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of the outstanding stock of a company. 

Reasons for the Merger    

Q:
Why are REMEC and Spectrian proposing the merger? (See pages 48 and 55)

A:
REMEC
and Spectrian believe that combining the products, services and technologies of the two companies will create a combined company strategically positioned to provide its customers
with superior integrated RF products. REMEC and Spectrian believe that the combined company will have a larger customer base, greater depth of skilled personnel, stronger research and development
capability, a stronger sales force, greater financial strength, a more concentrated sales effort and a higher market profile and operational efficiencies, all of which may create greater market
opportunities for the combined company and are expected to enhance the potential for greater value for the shareholders of the combined company. 

The
REMEC board of directors and the Spectrian board of directors believe that the merger may result in a number of benefits, including, among others: 


the
opportunity to respond more fully to the needs of multiple markets and industries for RF products;


the
combined company's potential to be a market leading provider of RF sub-assemblies; and


the
opportunity to further pursue the global capabilities of REMEC and Spectrian. 

Q:
Do the boards of directors of REMEC and Spectrian recommend voting in favor of the merger? (See pages 49 and 57)

A:
Yes.
The Spectrian board of directors has unanimously approved, and recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of, adopting and approving the merger agreement and approving the
merger. Similarly, the REMEC board of directors has unanimously approved, and recommends that its shareholders vote in favor of, the merger proposal. For a more complete description of the
recommendations of the boards of directors of both companies, see the sections entitled "The MergerREMEC's reasons for the merger" on page 48, and "The
MergerSpectrian's reasons for the merger" on page 55.

Q:
Do persons involved in the merger have interests which may conflict with mine as a Spectrian stockholder? (See page 65)

A.
Yes.
When considering the recommendations of Spectrian's board of directors, you should be aware that certain Spectrian directors and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, yours. These interests include employment of the Spectrian executive officers by REMEC after the merger, certain payments to Spectrian officers upon completion
of the merger, appointment of two current Spectrian board members to the REMEC board of directors and the indemnification of directors and officers of Spectrian against certain liabilities for events
that occurred or may occur before the merger is completed. 

Q:
Did REMEC's and Spectrian's financial advisors render favorable opinions concerning the merger? (See pages 49 and 58)

A.
Yes.


In
connection with its decision to approve and recommend the merger, REMEC's board of directors considered the opinion it received from REMEC's financial
advisor, Needham & Company, Inc., as to the fairness to REMEC, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by REMEC in the merger. The full text of Needham &
Company's written opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. REMEC shareholders are urged to read Needham & Company's opinion carefully and in its entirety
to understand the procedures followed, the assumptions made, the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken by Needham & Company in rendering its opinion. Needham &
Company's opinion was directed to the REMEC board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to any matter relating to the merger.


In
connection with its decision to approve and recommend the merger, Spectrian's board of directors considered the opinion it received from Spectrian's
financial advisor, RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., a member company of RBC Capital Markets, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Spectrian common stock, of the per
share merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. The full text of RBC's written opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. Spectrian stockholders
are urged to read RBC's opinion carefully and in its entirety to understand the procedures followed, the assumptions made, the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken by RBC in
rendering its opinion. RBC's opinion was directed to the Spectrian board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any matter relating to the merger.


The
written opinions of the financial advisors do not address the prices at which REMEC's common stock will trade after the proposed merger or represent a
recommendation by Needham & Company or RBC that REMEC shareholders or Spectrian stockholders vote in favor of the merger and the other matters set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Other Matters to Consider    

Q:
Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger? (See page 23)

A:
Yes.
In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" on page 23.

Q:
Am I entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights? (See pages 99 and 100)

A:
If
REMEC does not elect to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, Spectrian stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights. If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the
aggregate merger consideration with cash (not including the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of stock), Spectrian stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights. If a Spectrian
stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights, the Spectrian stockholder must precisely comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is reprinted in its entirety and attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.

you are a REMEC shareholder, under California law you may have the right to dissent from the merger by exercising dissenters' rights. If a REMEC shareholder elects to exercise dissenters' rights,
the REMEC shareholder must precisely comply with all of the procedures set forth in Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law. Chapter 13 of the California General 

Corporation Law is reprinted in its entirety and attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E.

Steps for You to Take Now    

Q:
As a Spectrian stockholder, what do I need to do now? (See pages 40 and 79)

A:
Mail
your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting. If you return a properly signed proxy
card but do not include instructions on how to vote your proxy, your shares will be voted "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. You should also
complete, sign and date the election form and transmittal letter and mail them with your Spectrian stock certificates in the enclosed return envelope for delivery on or before
[    ], 2002.

Q:
As a REMEC shareholder, what do I need to do now? (See page 37)

A:
Mail
your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting. You may instead vote by following the
telephone or Internet instructions on the proxy card. If you return a properly signed proxy card but do not include instructions on how to vote your proxy, your shares will be voted "FOR" the approval
of the merger proposal.

Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A:
Most
REMEC shareholders and Spectrian stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some
distinctions between shares held of record and shares beneficially owned. 

Shareholder of Record
.    If your shares are registered directly in your name with REMEC's or Spectrian's transfer agent, you are considered
the shareholder of record with respect to those shares and this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being sent directly to you by REMEC or Spectrian, as applicable. If you are a REMEC shareholder, as
shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your proxy directly to REMEC or to vote in person at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders. If you are a Spectrian stockholder, as stockholder of
record, you have the right to grant your proxy directly to Spectrian or to vote in person at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. As appropriate, REMEC or Spectrian has enclosed a proxy card
for your use. 

Beneficial Owner
.    If your shares are held in a brokerage account, bank account or by another nominee, you are considered the beneficial
owner of shares held in "street name," and this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee together with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial
owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote and are also invited to attend the applicable special meeting. 

However,
since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the applicable special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or nominee that
holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares instead of the broker, bank or nominee holding your shares. Your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed or provided voting instructions for
your use in directing your broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares. 

Q:
What do I do if I want to change my vote? (See pages 38 and 42)

A:
If
you are a shareholder of record and you want to change your vote,


send
the secretary of REMEC or Spectrian, as appropriate, a written notice that you wish to revoke your proxy;


send
the secretary of REMEC or Spectrian, as appropriate, a later-dated, signed proxy card before your special meeting; or


attend
your special meeting in person and vote in person. 

If
you are a beneficial owner and you want to change your vote, 


submit
new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee; or


obtain
a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee that gives you the right to vote your shares and attend your special meeting and vote in person. 

Q:
Should I send in my Spectrian stock certificate now? (See page 71)

A:
Yes.
Spectrian stockholders should send in their stock certificates, or a guarantee of their delivery, together with a properly completed and duly executed election form and
transmittal letter to the exchange agent as instructed in the election form and letter of transmittal. REMEC shareholders should not return REMEC stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

Q:
When and where will the votes take place? (See pages 37 and 40)

A.
REMEC special meeting of shareholders
.    The REMEC special meeting of shareholders will be held at REMEC's headquarters at
3790 Via de la Valle, Suite 311, Del Mar, California 92014 on              , 2002, starting at
[              .m.], local time. 

Spectrian special meeting of stockholders
.    The Spectrian special meeting of stockholders will be held at Spectrian's headquarters at 350
West Java Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089 on                 , 2002, starting at [        .m.], local time. 

Q:
What happens if a Spectrian stockholder does not vote? (See page 40)

A.
If
a Spectrian stockholder fails to submit a proxy or vote at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, it will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the merger. 

If
you return your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

If
you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the 

Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Q:
What happens if a REMEC shareholder does not vote? (See page 38)

A.
If
you are a REMEC shareholder and do not submit a proxy or vote at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders, it will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger
proposal. 

If
you submit a proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote to approve the merger proposal. 

If
you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the REMEC
special meeting of shareholders. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger proposal.

Subsequent events  

        A putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, on May 28, 2002, captioned 

Vogel v. Shaner,

 et al., Case No. CV808140. The complaint names six of Spectrian's directors and its chief executive officer as defendants. In the
complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties owed to Spectrian's stockholders, including their duties of loyalty, good faith and independence, by engaging in
self-dealing in the merger transaction with REMEC. This violation allegedly stemmed from the defendants' failure to properly value Spectrian in the merger due to conflicts of interest. The
plaintiff purportedly brought his action on behalf of Spectrian stockholders who are or would be harmed by the alleged conduct. The case seeks declaratory, injunctive and other forms of relief.
Spectrian and the defendant directors and officer believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend the case vigorously. 

        On
June 14, 2002, REMEC held its annual meeting of shareholders. At the annual meeting, REMEC shareholders (i) elected each of the six nominees for director named in
REMEC's 2002 proxy statement to serve for the ensuing year and until their successors are elected and (ii) approved an amendment to REMEC's Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number
of shares of REMEC common stock reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan from 2,700,000 to 3,450,000. Before the annual meeting, the REMEC board of directors appointed
Messrs. Nash and Gibbs to serve on the nominating committee of REMEC. Mr. Gibbs replaces Mr. Ragland, REMEC's Chairman, who will no longer serve as a member of the nominating

risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties involved in continued acceptance of the combined company's products and services; and


other
risk factors as may be detailed from time to time in REMEC's and Spectrian's public announcements and filings with the Securities and Exchange

Unaudited pro forma combined financial data  

        The following table sets forth selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data for REMEC and Spectrian, giving effect to the merger under the purchase method
of accounting. We have derived the selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data from the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, which we urge you to review. You should read the selected pro forma unaudited combined financial data in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and the financial statements of REMEC and the accompanying notes incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and in conjunction with
"Spectrian Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the financial statements of Spectrian and accompanying notes appearing in Spectrian's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2002, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. REMEC is currently having a valuation performed by a
third party valuation specialist and therefore the estimates and assumptions used in computing the proforma information below is preliminary and may change based on the results of the valuation
analysis. The selected pro forma combined financial data is not necessarily indicative of REMEC's and Spectrian's combined results of operations or the combined financial position that would have
resulted had the merger been consummated at the beginning of the applicable periods indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of REMEC's and Spectrian's results of operations in future periods or
the future financial position of the combined company.

May 3, 2002. 

2.
The
REMEC pro forma net loss per share is derived from the historical combined financial statements of REMEC after giving effect to the acquisition of Solitra on October 26,
2001, under the purchase method of accounting, and the assumptions and adjustments related to this acquisition described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements.

3.

Spectrian historical book value per share is calculated by dividing its stockholders' equity at March 31, 2002, by the total number of outstanding shares of its common stock
at that date.

4.
The
pro forma combined net loss per share is calculated by dividing the pro forma net loss by the pro forma number of diluted shares outstanding for the years ended January 31,
2002 and March 31, 2002 for REMEC and Spectrian, respectively.

5.
The
pro forma combined net loss per share is calculated by dividing the pro forma net loss by the pro forma number of diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended
May 3, 2002 and March 31, 2002, respectively.

6.
The
equivalent pro forma combined amounts are calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange ratio of 1.65 shares of REMEC common stock for each
share of Spectrian common stock.

7.
The
pro forma combined net book value per share is calculated by dividing the pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares outstanding as of May 3, 2002.

        REMEC
has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to REMEC's
common stock to be issued to Spectrian stockholders in the merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the prospectus of REMEC filed as part of the registration statement. This joint

this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to REMEC was provided by REMEC.

RISK FACTORS    

The merger involves a high degree of risk for REMEC's shareholders and Spectrian's stockholders. Spectrian's stockholders will be choosing
to invest in REMEC common stock by voting in favor of approving the merger proposal. An investment in REMEC common stock involves a high degree of risk. Spectrian stockholders and REMEC shareholders
will decide to combine the businesses of REMEC and Spectrian, which will change the business of both companies and involves significant risks. In addition to the other information contained or
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, both Spectrian stockholders and REMEC shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote
for the approval of the merger proposal, in the case of REMEC shareholders, or for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, in the case of Spectrian stockholders,
and refer to the matters discussed under the caption "Forward-looking statements" on page 14 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Risks related to the merger  

 Spectrian stockholders may not receive exactly $14.00 for each Spectrian share and the shares of REMEC common stock to be received by Spectrian's stockholders in the merger may decrease in value after
the exchange ratio is fixed.  

        The exchange ratio is a number equal to the quotient of $14.00 divided by the average trading price of REMEC common stock for the ten trading days ending two days
before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. The exchange ratio, however, is subject to a collar which means that regardless of REMEC's trading price, the exchange ratio will not be greater
than 2.0 or less than 1.33333. Accordingly, if the average trading price of REMEC common stock is greater than $10.50, the exchange ratio will be 1.33333 and if the average trading price of REMEC
common stock is less than $7.00, the exchange ratio will be 2.0. 

        After
the exchange ratio is fixed, the number of shares that Spectrian stockholders will receive in the transaction will not change, even if the market price of REMEC common stock
changes. There will be
no adjustment to the exchange ratio or right to terminate the merger agreement or the merger based solely on fluctuations in the price of REMEC common stock after the exchange ratio has been fixed. In
recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations have adversely affected the market price of REMEC common stock and may do so again in
the future. The market price of REMEC common stock upon and after completion of the proposed merger could be lower than the market price on the date the exchange ratio is set. You should obtain recent
market quotations of REMEC common stock. 

        In
addition, since the exchange ratio is subject to a collar, the number of shares issuable by REMEC is limited regardless of the trading price of REMEC common stock. This means that
even if the REMEC common stock is trading below $7.00, the holders of Spectrian common stock will receive REMEC common stock based on the $7.00 price and not the lower trading price. Similarly, if
REMEC's trading price is above $10.50, REMEC will be required to issue shares based on $10.50 price and not the higher trading price. 

 Integration of the two businesses may be difficult to achieve, which may adversely affect operations.  

        The merger involves risks related to the integration and management of technology, sales force, operations and personnel of two companies. The integration of the
businesses of REMEC and Spectrian will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt their businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. Following the
merger, REMEC and Spectrian must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communications systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices. 

        REMEC
and Spectrian may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in integrating their operations, including: 


potential
conflicts between business cultures; 

adverse
changes in business focus perceived by third-party constituencies; 

potential
conflicts in distribution, marketing or other important relationships; 

inability
to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; 

integration
of research and development and product development efforts; and 

loss
of key employees and/or the diversion of management's attention from other ongoing business concerns. 

        In
addition, Spectrian is headquartered in Northern California and REMEC is headquartered in Southern California. The geographic distances between the companies and their respective
offices and operations and the consolidation of operations increase the risk that the integration will not be completed successfully or in a timely and cost-effective manner. The
management of the combined company may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of the companies. 

 The costs to complete the merger are substantial. These costs and the manner of accounting for the merger may affect REMEC's, Spectrian's and the combined company's reported results of operations.  

        It is anticipated that REMEC and Spectrian will incur approximately $10 to $12 million of costs in connection with the merger. This includes costs
associated with combining the businesses of the two companies, such as integration and restructuring costs, costs associated with the consolidation of operations and the fees of financial advisors,
attorneys and accountants. REMEC and Spectrian may also recognize certain expenses prior to the closing of the merger, which may negatively affect their results of operations. A significant portion of
these costs will be charged to expense in the period incurred, reducing the combined company's earnings or increasing its loss for that period. The remaining costs, consisting primarily of fees and
expenses paid to financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, will be a component of the purchase price and capitalized as an element of goodwill. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at
least annually and the combined company will be required to record a charge to earnings in any period that impairment of goodwill is determined. 

        Management
of the combined company may not be able to effectively control the costs associated with the integration of the two companies. These costs may also be higher than anticipated.
If integration costs are not managed effectively or if they are higher than anticipated then the financial results and stock price of the combined company could be materially adversely affected. 

        A
substantial amount of these costs will be incurred whether or not the merger is completed. 

 If REMEC does not successfully integrate Spectrian or the merger's benefits do not meet the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts, the market price of REMEC common stock may
decline.  

        The market price of REMEC common stock may decline as a result of the merger for many reasons, including: 


the
integration of REMEC and Spectrian is not completed in a timely and efficient manner; 

perceived
benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by, financial or industry analysts; 

REMEC's
assumptions about Spectrian's business model and operations, considered on a stand-alone basis, such as the ability of Spectrian to move
manufacturing of its products to REMEC's facilities and to continue to execute its strategic plan, may prove incorrect; 


the
effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or 

significant
shareholders of REMEC following the merger decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their
expectations. 

 Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the market price of Spectrian common stock and REMEC common stock.  

        If the merger is not completed for any reason, Spectrian and REMEC will be subject to a number of material risks, including: 


the
provision in the merger agreement which provides that Spectrian could be required in certain circumstances to pay REMEC a termination fee of $6,000,000; 

the
market price of Spectrian common stock and REMEC common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of such shares reflects a market
assumption that the merger will be completed; 

costs
related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger is not
completed; 

benefits
that REMEC expects to realize from the merger, such as the potentially enhanced competitive position of the combined company, would not be realized;
and 

the
diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of Spectrian, reduction in capital spending and the unavoidable
disruption to its employees and its relationships with customers and suppliers, during the period before consummation of the merger, may make it difficult for Spectrian to regain its financial and
market position if the merger does not occur. 

        If
the merger is terminated and the Spectrian board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Spectrian stockholders cannot be certain that Spectrian will be able to
find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by REMEC in the merger. 

 During the pendency of the merger, Spectrian may not be able to enter into a merger or business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the merger agreement.  

        Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Spectrian is prohibited from entering into or soliciting,
initiating or encouraging any inquiries or proposals that may lead to a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial assets, tender offer, sale of shares of
capital stock or other similar transactions with any person or entity other than REMEC. As a result of these prohibitions, Spectrian may not be able to enter into an alternative transaction at a
favorable price or at all. 

 Spectrian executive officers and directors have interests that may influence them to support and approve the merger.  

        Some of the directors and executive officers of Spectrian will receive continuing indemnification against liabilities and certain payments and have Spectrian
stock, stock options and employment offers that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, your interests in the merger. In addition, upon the completion
of the merger, if terminated or constructively terminated, Messrs. Waechter, Piazza and Jones will also be entitled to acceleration of vesting of all or a portion of their stock options and
severance payments. Other Spectrian officers may become entitled to severance payments or acceleration of vesting of outstanding stock options if they are terminated or constructively terminated after
the closing of the merger. As a result, these directors and officers may be more likely to vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger than if 

they did not have these interests. See the section entitled "The MergerInterests of certain persons in the merger" beginning on page 65. 

 Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause Spectrian to lose key personnel.  

        Current and prospective Spectrian employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with REMEC. This uncertainty may adversely affect Spectrian's
ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. 

 REMEC's articles of incorporation and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions, which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt.  

        Some provisions of REMEC's articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of California law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover
that might result in a premium over the market price for its common stock. These provisions include: 

        Cumulative voting.
    REMEC shareholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors. This may limit the ability of the
shareholders to remove a director other than for cause. 

        Shareholder rights plan.
    REMEC may trigger its shareholder rights plan in the event its board of directors does not agree to
an acquisition proposal. The rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire REMEC. 

        Preferred stock.
    REMEC's articles of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine what rights, preferences and privileges such shares have. No action by the REMEC shareholders is necessary before its board of directors can issue the preferred stock.
The REMEC board of directors could use the preferred stock to make it more difficult and costly to acquire REMEC. 

 Some executive officers and key personnel are critical to the business of the combined company and these officers and key personnel may not remain with the combined company in the future.  

        The success of the combined company following the merger depends upon the continued service of some executive officers and other key personnel. Upon completion of
the merger, Thomas H. Waechter, Spectrian's President and Chief Executive Officer, will become the President and Chief Operating Officer of REMEC. David Piazza, Vice President of Research and
Development of Spectrian, will become the General Manager of Amplifier Products. If the combined company loses the services of Ronald E. Ragland, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of REMEC,
Mr. Waechter or Mr. Piazza one or more of its other executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of these individuals decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly
or indirectly with the combined company, the combined company's business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. 

Risks common to the businesses of REMEC and Spectrian  

 The wireless industry is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards.  

        The markets in which REMEC and Spectrian currently operate, and the combined company will operate, are characterized by rapidly changing technology, short product
life cycle, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services. A softening of demand in the markets served by REMEC or Spectrian may have a material adverse effect on
the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that the combined company's product development efforts will be successful, that its new products
will meet customer requirements and be accepted or that its original equipment manufacturer customers' product offerings will achieve customer acceptance. If a significant number of development
projects, including 

Spectrian's new multicarrier products, do not result in substantial volume production or if technologies or standards supported by the combined company or its customers' products become obsolete or
fail to
gain widespread commercial acceptance, the combined company's business may be materially adversely affected. 

 The wireless infrastructure equipment market has experienced significant decline in revenues and product orders.  

        REMEC's and Spectrian's revenues are, and the combined company's revenues will be, derived primarily from sales to wireless network operators and original
equipment manufacturers in the wireless infrastructure equipment market. Any significant downturn in the wireless infrastructure equipment market, or domestic or international conditions, which result
in the reduction of capital expenditure budgets or the delay in product orders would likely lead to a decrease in demand for the combined company's products. Since early 2001, the wireless
infrastructure equipment market has experienced a significant decline in revenue and product orders. If the combined company's customers decide to delay their product orders or reduce their capital
expenditures, the combined company's revenues, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 

 Because REMEC's and Spectrian's financial and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter, the combined company's operating results may be negatively affected.  

        REMEC's and Spectrian's quarterly and annual results have in the past been subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors, any of which could have
a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

        In
particular, the combined company's results of operations are likely to vary due to: 


the
timing, cancellation, delay or rescheduling of original equipment manufacturer and network operator customer orders and shipments; 

the
timing of announcements or introductions of new products by the combined company, its competitors or their respective original equipment manufacturer
customers; 

the
acceptance of products by wireless equipment original equipment manufacturers and their customers and by network operators; 

relative
variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs; 

competitive
factors such as the pricing, availability, and demand for competing products; 

changes
in average sales prices and related gross margins which vary significantly based upon product mix; 

subcontractor
performance; 

variations
in operating expenses; 

changes
in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of this capacity; 

shortages
of key supplies; 

the
long sales cycles associated with REMEC's and Spectrian's products; 

cancellation
of existing programs which may result in excess inventory charges; 

the
timing and level of product and process development costs; 

changes
in inventory levels; and 

the
relative strength or weakness of international financial markets. 

        Anticipated
orders from customers have in the past failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred or canceled as a result of changes in customer requirements. The
combined company expects this pattern to continue as customer requirements continue to change and industry standards continue to evolve. 

        Reduced
demand for wireless infrastructure equipment in the past has caused significant fluctuations in REMEC's and Spectrian's product sales. We cannot assure you that the combined
company will not experience similar fluctuations in the future. REMEC and Spectrian establish their expenditure levels and budgets for product development and other operating expenses based on
expected revenues, and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. As a result, variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations. We cannot
assure you that the combined company will be profitable on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the future. Neither REMEC nor Spectrian believes that
period-to-period comparisons of financial results is necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 

        Due
to all the foregoing factors, it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the combined company's revenues or operating results will not meet the expectations of public stock
market analysts or investors. In such event, the market price of REMEC's common stock may be materially adversely affected. 

 The market for the combined company's products is highly competitive.  

        The wireless communications equipment industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, new product development and product
obsolescence, evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product. The ability of the combined company to compete successfully and sustain profitability depends in
part upon the rates at which wireless original equipment manufacturers and network operators incorporate the combined company's products into their systems and the combined company captures market
share from other suppliers. 

        For
example, Spectrian's major original equipment manufacturer customers continuously evaluate whether to manufacture their own amplifier products or purchase those products from outside
sources. We cannot assure you that these original equipment manufacturer customers will incorporate Spectrian's products into their systems or that in general they will continue to rely, or expand
their reliance, on external sources of supply for their power amplifiers. These customers and other large manufacturers of wireless communications equipment could also elect to enter the merchant
market and compete directly with the combined company, and at least two original equipment manufacturers, NEC Corporation and Lucent Technologies, have already done so. This increased competition
could materially adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

        We
cannot assure you that the combined company's competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to existing products or introduce new products that will offer superior
price or performance features compared to the combined company's products. 

 Inventory write-offs or write-downs may materially and adversely affect the combined company's results of operations.  

        REMEC and Spectrian sell their products, and the combined company will sell its products, on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase
commitments, and any customer may cancel or defer its purchase orders without advance notice. These contractual relationships with major customers may adversely affect the combined company's ability
to efficiently manage its production schedules and inventory levels and to accurately forecast product sales. Any reduction in levels of purchases or any material reduction in pricing without
significant offsets would have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if anticipated 

orders fail to materialize or if delivery schedules are deferred or cancelled, the combined company may be required to take charges related to excess or obsolete inventory. If the combined company
were to take such charges, its results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

 Conducting business in international markets involves risk that may negatively impact the combined company's financial results.  

        REMEC and Spectrian currently operate, and the combined company will operate, in the international market place. REMEC and Spectrian anticipate that international
sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the combined company's total revenue for the foreseeable future. These sales involve a number of inherent risks, including imposition of
government controls, currency exchange fluctuations, potential insolvency of international distributors, representatives and customers, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
countries, the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the United States, political instability and generally longer receivables collection periods, as well as tariffs and other trade
barriers. In addition, because substantially all of the foreign sales by REMEC and Spectrian are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency
would increase the price of the combined company's products in foreign markets and make the combined company's products relatively more expensive than competitors' products that are priced in local
currencies. We cannot assure you that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the combined company's future international sales and, consequently, on the combined company's business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

        Both
REMEC and Spectrian anticipate that turmoil in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain countries where they have significant sales
may have an impact on their sales to customers located in or whose projects are based in those countries due to the
impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of their products and restrictions on government spending imposed by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, on those countries receiving IMF's
assistance. In addition, customers in those countries may face reduced access to working capital to fund component purchases, higher interest rates on borrowings, reduced funding of wireless
infrastructure by domestic governments, reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer's or its bank's financial condition or the inability to access
equity financing. A substantial majority of REMEC's and Spectrian's products are sold to original equipment manufacturers who incorporate REMEC's and Spectrian's products into systems sold and
installed to end-user customers. These original equipment manufacturers are not required by contract and do not typically provide REMEC or Spectrian, as the case may be, with information
regarding the location and identity of their end-user customers, and, therefore, REMEC and Spectrian are not, and the combined company will not be, able to determine what portion of its
product sales have been or future orders will be incorporated into original equipment manufacturer sales to end-users in countries experiencing financial market turmoil and/or
deterioration of economic conditions. Furthermore, a large portion of REMEC's and Spectrian's existing customers and potential new customers are servicing new markets in developing countries that
REMEC's and Spectrian's customers, as the case may be, expect will deploy wireless communication networks as an alternative to the construction of a wireline infrastructure. If these countries decline
to construct wireless communication systems, or construction of these systems is delayed for any reason, including business and economic conditions and changes in economic stability due to factors
such as increased inflation and political turmoil, these delays could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 Failure by the combined company to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology, intellectual property and manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating
results, financial condition of the combined company and on its ability to compete effectively.  

        REMEC and Spectrian principally rely upon patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and contract law to establish and protect their proprietary rights. There is
a risk that claims allowed on any patents or trademarks that REMEC and Spectrian hold may not be broad enough to protect the technology of the combined company. In addition REMEC's and Spectrian's
patents or trademarks may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and management cannot be certain that those rights will provide competitive advantages to the combined company. Moreover, any
current or future issued or licensed patents, or trademarks, or currently existing or future developed trade secrets or know-how, may not afford sufficient protection against competitors
with similar technologies or processes, and the possibility exists that certain of REMEC's and Spectrian's already issued patents or trademarks may infringe upon third party patents or trademarks. 

        In
addition, others may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes which are the same as, substantially equivalent to or superior to those of the combined company, or
those technologies and processes may become available in the market at a lower price. 

        If
it is determined that REMEC or Spectrian has infringed patents or trademarks owned by others, and that the combined company will need to acquire licenses under patents or trademarks
belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to the combined company. These licenses will not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

        The
combined company may have to litigate to enforce its patents or trademarks or to determine the scope and validity of other parties' proprietary rights. Litigation could be very
costly and divert management's attention. An adverse outcome in any litigation may have a severe negative effect on the financial results and stock price of the combined company. 

        Both
REMEC and Spectrian also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which they seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with their employees, consultants,
service providers and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and the remedies available to the combined company may not be adequate. In addition, REMEC's and Spectrian's trade secrets and
proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to or be independently discovered by others. 

 If the combined company fails to adequately manage the size of its business, its financial results and stock price could be negatively affected.  

        REMEC and Spectrian believe that in order to be successful, the combined company must appropriately manage the size of its business. This will mean reducing costs
and overhead following the merger in an effort to integrate the two businesses and may mean reducing costs in certain economic periods and selectively growing in periods of economic expansion. In
addition, the combined company will be required to implement operational, financial and management information procedures and controls that are efficient and appropriate for the size and scope of its
operations. The management skills and systems currently in place may not be adequate and we may not be able to manage any significant reductions or growth effectively. 

 Acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to the combined company's business.  

        REMEC has made a number of acquisitions over the last several years, each of which has required and continues to require significant management time and resources
to integrate and may interfere with integration of Spectrian into REMEC. REMEC and Spectrian anticipate that integrating Spectrian into REMEC will require substantial management resources and time to
complete. Any other 

acquisitions and/or mergers by REMEC or the combined company are and will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things: 


exposure
to unknown liabilities of acquired companies;


higher
than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;


effects
of costs and expenses of acquiring and integrating new businesses on the operating results and financial condition of the combined company;


difficulty
and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies;


disruption
of the combined company's ongoing business;


diversion
of management time and attention;


failure
to maximize the combined company's financial and strategic position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology;


inability
to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;


loss
of manufacturers;


loss
of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management;


incurrence
of amortization expenses; and


possible
dilution to the shareholders of the combined company. 

 If the combined company fails to attract and retain qualified senior executives and key technical personnel, its business may not be able to expand.  

        REMEC's and Spectrian's operations are dependent on the continued availability of the services of their respective employees, many of whom are individually key to
the future success of the combined company, and the availability of new employees to implement the growth plans of the combined company. REMEC and Spectrian personnel may voluntarily terminate their
relationship with the combined company at any time. The process of locating additional personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the combined company's strategy
could be lengthy, costly and disruptive. 

        If
the combined company loses the services of key personnel, or fails to replace the services of key personnel who depart, the financial results and stock price of the combined company
could be adversely affected. The loss of the services of any key engineering or other personnel or the failure of the combined company to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional key
employees could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating and financial results and stock price. 

 The communications industry is highly regulated.  

        RF transmissions and emissions, and certain equipment used in connection therewith are regulated in the United States, Canada and throughout the rest of the
world. Regulatory approvals generally must be obtained by a company in connection with the manufacture and sale of its products, and by wireless service providers to operate such products. The United
States Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, and regulatory authorities abroad constantly review RF emission issues and promulgate standards based on their reviews. If more stringent RF
emission regulations are adopted, the combined company and its original equipment manufacturer customers may be required to alter the manner in which radio signals are transmitted or otherwise alter
the equipment transmitting these signals, which could materially adversely affect the combined company's products and markets. The enactment by federal, state, local or international governments of
new laws or regulations or a change 

in the interpretation of existing regulations could also materially adversely affect the market for the combined company's products. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted
pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products, generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies. The delays inherent in
this governmental approval process have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, the cancellation, postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by customers.
These delays have had in the past, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on the sale of products by the combined company to its customers. 

 Compliance with environmental regulations is costly and burdensome.  

        Both REMEC and Spectrian are, and the combined company will be, subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage,
discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture the combined company's products. Failure to comply with current or future
regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on the combined company, suspension of production, alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. Compliance with
these regulations could require the combined company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses. Any failure by the combined company to control the use, disposal,
removal or storage, to adequately restrict the discharge or assist in the cleanup, of hazardous or toxic substances could subject the combined company to significant liabilities, including joint and
several liabilities under certain statutes. The imposition of these liabilities could materially adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks related to REMEC's business  

 REMEC's continued efforts to service the defense market may limit REMEC's revenue growth.  

        REMEC makes a substantial portion of its sales to the U.S. defense market. As a result, lower defense spending by the U.S. government could materially reduce
REMEC's revenues. Lower defense spending by the U.S. government on programs in which REMEC's products are used might occur because of defense budget cuts, general budget cuts or other reasons. 

        REMEC
expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from defense programs and to continue to develop microwave products for defense applications. If a significant
defense program or contract ends, and REMEC fails to replace sales from that program or contract, REMEC's revenues will decline. In addition, a large portion of REMEC's expenses is fixed and difficult
to reduce, thus magnifying the negative effect of any shortfall in revenue. 

 REMEC's defense development contracts could cause its quarterly results to fluctuate.  

        REMEC enters into defense industry development contracts as a source of revenues. Development contracts tend to be fixed price contracts that generally result in
lower gross profit margins than
production contracts. As a result, REMEC's increased reliance on development contracts has led to increased quarterly fluctuations in sales and gross profit margins. Accordingly, REMEC's comparative
performance from one fiscal quarter to the next is not necessarily an accurate indicator of REMEC's future performance. 

 REMEC's exclusive arrangements with some customers may limit its pursuit of market opportunities and may result in a loss of revenues.  

        REMEC has granted some of its customers exclusivity on specific products, which means that it is only permitted to sell those specially engineered products to
them. REMEC expects that in some cases its existing customers and new customers may require REMEC to give them exclusivity on new products that REMEC makes for them. By entering into exclusive
arrangements, REMEC may forego opportunities to supply these products to other companies. In addition, if REMEC enters into exclusive relationships with customers which prove to be unsuccessful,
REMEC's revenues will be negatively affected. REMEC may not be able to establish business relationships, or negotiate acceptable arrangements, with significant customers in the future. Also, REMEC's
current or future arrangements with significant customers may not continue or be successful. 

 REMEC's dependence on suppliers may decrease REMEC's timeliness of product delivery to customers, which may result in lost revenues.  

        REMEC relies on suppliers, in some cases sole suppliers or limited groups of suppliers, to provide it with services and materials necessary for the manufacture of
REMEC's products. If REMEC is not able to obtain sufficient allocations of these components, REMEC's production and shipment of product will be delayed, REMEC may lose customers and its profitability
will be adversely affected. 

        Other
risks relating to REMEC's reliance on sole suppliers include reduced control over productions costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality of materials. Any inability to
obtain timely deliveries of acceptable quality materials, or any other circumstances that would require REMEC to seek alternative suppliers, could adversely affect its ability to deliver products to
its customers. In addition, if costs for REMEC's suppliers increase, REMEC may suffer losses if it is unable to recover those cost increases under fixed-price production commitments to its customers. 

 Fixed-price contracts may increase risks of cost overruns and product non-performance.  

        REMEC's customers establish demanding specifications for product performance, reliability and cost. Most of REMEC's customer contracts are firm fixed-price
contracts. Firm fixed-price contracts provide for a predetermined fixed price for the products REMEC makes, regardless of the costs it incurs. REMEC has made pricing commitments to customers based
upon REMEC's expectation that it will achieve more cost effective product designs and automate more of its manufacturing operations. 

        Manufacture
of REMEC's products is an extremely complex process. REMEC faces risks of cost overruns or order cancellations if it fails to achieve forecast product design and
manufacturing efficiencies or if products cost more to produce than expected. Production costs can rise due to increased cost of materials, components or labor, or other factors. REMEC may have cost
overruns or problems with the performance or reliability of its products in the future. 

 REMEC's stock price may fluctuate significantly.  

        The market price of REMEC common stock, like the stock prices of many companies in the telecommunications industry, is subject to wide fluctuations in response to
a variety of factors, including: actual or anticipated operating results; announcements of technological innovations; announcements of new products or new contracts by REMEC, REMEC's competitors or
customers; government regulatory action; developments with respect to wireless telecommunications; and general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the stock market has from time to time
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices for the stocks of technology companies and have often been unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. The market price of REMEC common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile. 

 Difficulties converting to a new enterprise resource planning application could interfere with the combined company's business and hamper its integration efforts.  

        REMEC is currently in the process of converting its existing enterprise resource planning, or ERP, application to a new ERP application. This conversion has
entailed, and will continue to entail, significant expense and management attention. If this conversion fails or takes significantly longer than expected, or if the new system works improperly, the
combined company's business, including its efforts to integrate the business of Spectrian, could be adversely affected. 

Risks related to Spectrian's business  

 Spectrian depends on a few large customers for substantially all of its revenues.  

        The wireless infrastructure equipment market is dominated by a small number of large original equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators, including
AT&T Wireless, Inc., Ericsson Wireless Communications, Inc., Nokia OY, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Motorola Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Nortel Networks
Corporation, Verizon Communications, Inc., Cingular Wireless LLC, Japan Radio Co. Ltd., Sprint Corporation and Siemens AG. Spectrian's revenues are derived primarily from sales to
Spectrian's limited number of customers, in particular, Nortel, Verizon, Samsung and Cingular. Furthermore, a substantial portion of Spectrian's revenues from Nortel in the past has resulted from
sales of a limited number of Spectrian's products. Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected in the past by anticipated orders failing
to materialize, by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements and from the timing of the build out of new wireless networks. Spectrian and Nortel have a
supply agreement, renegotiated annually, pursuant to which Nortel commits to purchase a certain volume of its annual power amplifier requirements for specified prices from Spectrian. This agreement
allows Nortel to change the product mix requirements, which can significantly affect Spectrian's gross margins, and to change requested delivery dates without significant financial consequences to
Nortel. In addition, Spectrian's sales to Verizon, Samsung and Cingular are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments and any of these
customers may cancel or defer its purchase orders without advanced notice to Spectrian. Spectrian's contractual relationships with its major customers may adversely affect Spectrian's ability to
efficiently manage production schedules and inventory levels and to accurately forecast product sales. Any reduction in the level of purchases of Spectrian's amplifiers by Nortel, Verizon, Samsung or
Cingular, or any material reduction in pricing without significant offsets, would have a material adverse effect on Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in
the second and third quarters of fiscal 2002, single carrier amplifier product orders from Nortel fell substantially and Spectrian does not currently sell any multi-carrier power amplifier products to
Nortel, which has adversely affected Spectrian's business. Spectrian cannot assure you that it will receive any product orders for multi-carrier power amplifier products or any other products from
Nortel in the future. If Spectrian's current or new customers do not generate sufficient demand for Spectrian's new products replacing prior demand from Nortel, Spectrian's business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Further, if Spectrian were to lose Nortel, Verizon, Samsung, Cingular or any other major customer, Spectrian's business,
financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, the network operator market has been and is expected to continue experiencing an industry
consolidation which has and will continue to have a negative impact on Spectrian's ability to diversify its customer base. Wireless infrastructure equipment original equipment manufacturers have come
under increasing price pressure from wireless network operators, which in turn has resulted in downward pricing pressure on Spectrian's products. Spectrian expects to incur increasing pricing
pressures from Nortel, Verizon, Samsung, Cingular and other major customers in future periods, which could result in declining average sales prices and gross margins for Spectrian's products. 

 The continued declining average sales prices for Spectrian's products may materially and adversely affect Spectrian's results of operations.  

        Spectrian has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, declining average sales prices for all its products, especially its single carrier power
amplifiers, and in all geographical markets. Wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers have come under increasing price pressure from wireless network operators, which in turn has resulted in
downward pricing pressure on Spectrian's products. In addition, competition among merchant amplifier suppliers has increased the downward pricing pressure on Spectrian's products and certain customer
contracts have pricing terms that allow these customers to purchase Spectrian's products at the lowest available market price. Since wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers frequently
negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates, Spectrian often must commit to price reductions for its products before it is aware of how, or if, cost reductions can be obtained. To
offset declining average sales prices, Spectrian believes that it must achieve manufacturing cost reductions. If Spectrian is unable to achieve such cost reductions, Spectrian's gross margins will
decline and the decline will have a material adverse effect on Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 If Spectrian's products do not meet customer specifications, Spectrian's business will be harmed.  

        Spectrian expects that its customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability that must be met by Spectrian's
products. Power amplifiers as complex as those Spectrian offers often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures. Spectrian has from time to time in the past
experienced product quality, performance and reliability problems. In addition, Spectrian's multi-carrier power amplifier products have a higher theoretical probability of malfunction than its single
carrier power amplifier products due to their greater complexity. Spectrian cannot assure you that defects or failures relating to its product quality, performance and reliability will not occur in
the future that may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 Competition resulting from an original equipment manufacturer's decision to design and produce amplifiers internally could materially and adversely affect Spectrian's business.  

        Spectrian believes that a majority of the present worldwide production of power amplifiers is captive within the manufacturing operations of wireless equipment
original equipment manufacturers, many of
which have chosen not to purchase a significant volume of amplifiers from outside suppliers. In addition, these manufacturers could decide to sell amplifiers to other wireless equipment original
equipment manufacturers, either through direct sales or by spinning out their amplifier division as a separate entity. If this should occur, the competition for power amplifiers would significantly
increase and could have a material adverse effect on Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

        Spectrian
also believes that those original equipment manufacturers that purchase from third party amplifier vendors are reluctant to switch once committed to a particular merchant
vendor. Consequently, Spectrian has only limited opportunities to increase revenues by replacing internal original equipment manufacturer amplifier production or displacing other merchant amplifier
suppliers. Moreover, given the limited opportunities for merchant power amplifier suppliers, any decision by an original equipment manufacturer to employ a second source merchant supplier for a
product currently purchased from a merchant supplier may reduce the existing merchant supplier's ability to maintain a given level of product sales to such original equipment manufacturer or,
possibly, to retain the original equipment manufacturer as a customer due to price competition from the second source merchant supplier. Spectrian cannot assure you that its major original equipment
manufacturer customers will continue to rely, or increase their reliance, on Spectrian as an external source of supply for their power amplifiers, or that other wireless equipment original equipment
manufacturers will become customers of Spectrian. If the major wireless infrastructure equipment suppliers do not purchase or do not continue to purchase their power amplifiers from merchant
suppliers, Spectrian's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. 

 Spectrian's purchase commitments under the Cree supply agreement could materially and adversely affect its results of operations.  

        In connection with Spectrian's completion of the sale of its UltraRF division to Cree, Inc., Spectrian entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement, dated
as of December 29, 2000, as amended on October 2001 and April 2002, which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Purchase and Supply Agreement. Pursuant to
the Purchase and Supply Agreement, Spectrian committed to purchase and accept delivery from UltraRF of $54.8 million of semiconductors over a 27-month period starting
January 2001. The quarterly commitments to purchase and accept delivery of semiconductor components from UltraRF range from approximately $1.3 million to $8.3 million. As of
March 31, 2002, Spectrian's remaining purchase commitment was $21.3 million. Spectrian's need for UltraRF components during a calendar quarter may be insufficient to satisfy its minimum
commitments for such calendar quarter. In such event, Spectrian would be obligated to purchase excess inventory that it may never utilize or to pay a shortfall surcharge in cash, either of which could
have a material adverse effect on Spectrian's business, financial condition and cash flow. 

 If Spectrian loses products, materials and services from its sole or limited sources, its business will be materially and adversely affected.  

        Spectrian currently procures from single sources certain of its power amplifier assemblies, specialized semiconductors, components and services for its products.
Spectrian purchases these products, components and services on a purchase order basis, does not carry significant inventories of these components and does not have any long-term supply
contracts with its sole source vendors. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, Spectrian completed the transfer of the production of power amplifiers to a contract manufacturer in Thailand.
As a result of this transfer, Spectrian no longer has significant manufacturing capacity. Spectrian issues non-cancelable purchase orders to the contract manufacturer 60 days in
advance of requested delivery, which is greater than the committed delivery schedule of some of its customers, such as Nortel. In addition, Spectrian transferred its power amplifier repair operations
to the same contract manufacturer in Thailand. As a result of this transfer, Spectrian no longer has significant amplifier repair capacity. On December 29, 2000, Spectrian completed the sale of
UltraRF to Cree. As a result, Spectrian no longer manufactures bipolar and laterally diffused metal oxide, or LDMOS, RF power semiconductors, which are critical components in Spectrian's power
amplifier products. Consequently, Cree is Spectrian's sole source vendor of certain bipolar and LDMOS RF power semiconductors. Spectrian's reliance on sole sources for certain components and its
migration to an outsourced, turnkey manufacturing and repair services strategy entail certain risks including reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality of the components
and reliance on the financial strength and continued relationship with the contract manufacturer. In calendar 2001, the financial strength of Spectrian's primary sole source contract manufacturer may
have become impaired due to the declaration of bankruptcy by its U.S. parent corporation. Although Spectrian has taken measures to protect itself in the event that this contract manufacturer declares
bankruptcy or is placed in receivership, Spectrian may suffer a loss of assets or disruption of its manufacturing processes and Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations may
be adversely affected. If Spectrian were to change any of its sole source vendors or contract manufacturer, Spectrian would be required to requalify its components with each new vendor or contract
manufacturer, respectively, as well as with each of its customers. Any inability of Spectrian to obtain timely deliveries of components, repair services, assembled amplifiers or RF power
semiconductors of acceptable quality in required quantities or a significant increase in the prices of components for which Spectrian does not have alternative sources could materially and adversely
affect Spectrian's business, financial condition and results of operations. Spectrian has occasionally experienced difficulties in obtaining some components, and Spectrian cannot assure you that
shortages will not occur in the future. 

THE REMEC SPECIAL MEETING    

Date, time, place and purpose of the REMEC special meeting  

        A special meeting of REMEC shareholders will be held at
[                        ] local time on
[                        ] 2002 at
REMEC's principal executive offices located at 3790 Via de la Valle, Suite 311, Del Mar, California 92014. At the REMEC special meeting, shareholders will be asked: 

1.
To
consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of May 19, 2002 by and among REMEC, REEF Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC, and Spectrian, to approve the merger provided for therein, and to approve the issuance of shares of REMEC common stock in connection with
the merger. 
2.
To
transact any other business that may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

Record date and outstanding shares  

        Only REMEC shareholders of record at the close of business on June 14, 2002, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the REMEC special
meeting. As of the record date, there were [            ] shares of REMEC common stock, par value $0.01 per share, outstanding and entitled to vote held by
[            ] shareholders of record. 

Shares beneficially owned by REMEC directors and executive officers as of the record date  

        As of the record date, directors and executive officers of REMEC and their affiliates beneficially owned, and were entitled to vote 4,121,265 shares of
REMEC common stock, or approximately 9.14% of the shares outstanding as of the close of business on June 14, 2002. 

        Directors
who together beneficially hold approximately 4.06% of the REMEC common stock outstanding as of June 14, 2002, have entered into voting agreements with Spectrian and
agreed, in their capacities as shareholders of REMEC, to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the issuance of REMEC common stock in the merger. 

Recommendation of the REMEC board of directors  

        The REMEC board of directors has concluded that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the REMEC shareholders and
unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote FOR the merger proposal. 

Vote required  

        Each REMEC shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share of REMEC common stock on all matters at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders. Approval of the
merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. 

Quorum requirements  

        A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
REMEC common stock entitled to vote at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders will constitute quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as votes against the approval of
the merger proposal. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary
voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 

General proxy information  

        Each of the persons named as proxies in REMEC's proxy is an officer of REMEC. All shares of REMEC common stock that are entitled to vote and are represented at
the REMEC special meeting of shareholders by properly executed proxies received prior to or at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders and not duly and timely revoked will be voted at the REMEC
special meeting of shareholders in accordance with instructions indicated on such proxies. If you submit your proxy but do not make specific choices, your proxy will follow the board recommendations
and vote your shares "FOR" the proposals. 

        Any
proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked by: 


filing
with the secretary of REMEC at or before the taking of the vote at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders, a written notice of revocation bearing a
later date than the proxy; 

duly
executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to the secretary of REMEC before the taking of the vote at the REMEC special
meeting of shareholders; 

attending
the REMEC special meeting of shareholders and voting in person (although attendance at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders will not in and of
itself constitute a revocation of a proxy). 

        Any
written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to REMEC at 3790 Via de la Valle, Suite 311, Del Mar, California 92014, Attention:
Secretary, or hand delivered to the Secretary of REMEC, in each case at or before the taking of the vote at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders. 

        If
you are a shareholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote in person even if you have previously returned a proxy card or voted by telephone or via the Internet. If
you are not a shareholder of record, but your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee (
i.e
., held in "street name"), you will not
be able to vote in person at the special meeting unless you obtain and present a legal proxy issued in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares. 

Internet and telephone voting  

        REMEC shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote either via the Internet or by telephone. Specific instructions to be followed by any
registered shareholder interested in voting via the Internet or by telephone are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate
shareholders' identities, allow shareholders to give their voting instructions and confirm that shareholders' voting instructions have been properly recorded. 

        If
your shares are registered in the name of a bank or brokerage firm, you may be eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet or by telephone. A large number of banks
and brokerage firms offer Internet and telephone voting. If your bank or brokerage firm offers Internet and telephone voting, your proxy card will provide specific instructions. If your proxy card
does not reference Internet or telephone voting information, please complete and return your proxy card in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided. 

Effect of abstaining  

        You may abstain from voting on the approval of the merger proposal. If you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to any proposal, you will be in effect voting
against the proposal. In addition, if you fail to send in your proxy card, or vote by telephone or the Internet, this will have the effect of a vote against the approval of the merger proposal. 

Broker non-votes  

        If you are a REMEC shareholder and your broker holds shares in its name, your broker cannot vote your shares without your instructions. A "broker
non-vote" will occur if your broker does not vote your shares because you did not provide voting instructions. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the
approval of the merger proposal. 

Solicitation of proxies  

        REMEC and Spectrian will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, we
may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain REMEC directors, officers and regular employees personally or by telephone, telegram, letter or facsimile. Such persons
will not receive additional compensation, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such solicitation. Arrangements will also be
made with custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding of proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners of shares held of record by such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, and we will
reimburse such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith. 

Other business and adjournments  

        REMEC is not currently aware of any business other than the merger proposal to be acted upon at the REMEC special meeting of shareholders. If, however, any other
matters are properly brought before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion
to vote or act on those matters in accordance with their best judgment, including any proposal to adjourn the special meeting; provided, however, that a proxy voted against the merger proposal will
not be voted in favor of adjournment of the special meeting. 

        Adjournments
may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of the holders of shares
representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without further notice other than by an announcement at the special meeting.
If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or a new record date is fixed for the adjourned special meeting, a notice of the adjourned special meeting will be given to each REMEC shareholder
entitled to vote at the special meeting. REMEC does not currently intend to seek an adjournment of its special meeting unless such an adjournment is necessary to solicit additional votes. 

Rights to dissent and appraisal  

        You are entitled to dissent from the proposed merger and demand appraisal of your shares of REMEC common stock. If you wish to dissent, you must follow the
specific procedures set forth in the California General Corporation Law, as described in detail in the section titled "Rights of AppraisalREMEC Shareholders" on page 100. The full
text of the relevant sections of the California General Corporation Law is also attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. 

THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE REMEC SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF REMEC. ACCORDINGLY, REMEC SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ AND
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE ENCLOSED REMEC PROXY IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE PAID ENVELOPE,
OR VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR ON THE INTERNET.

THE SPECTRIAN SPECIAL MEETING    

Joint proxy statement/prospectus  

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Spectrian board of directors in connection
with the proposed merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to Spectrian stockholders on or about
[                        ], 2002. 

Date, time and place of the special meeting  

        The special meeting of Spectrian stockholders is scheduled to be held as follows: 

West Java Drive

Sunnyvale, California 94089

[                        ], 2002

[    ]:00 [    ].m., local time 

Purpose of the special meeting  

        At the special meeting, Spectrian will ask you to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger provided for
therein. 

        If
the Spectrian stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and the other conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, Spectrian will
merge with REEF Acquisition Corp. and become a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC. You will be entitled to receive $14.00 a share, consisting of REMEC common stock at the applicable exchange ratio or
cash,
at REMEC's election, or a combination thereof, for each share of Spectrian common stock you hold on the effective date of the merger. 

Recommendation of the Spectrian board of directors  

        The Spectrian board of directors has concluded that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Spectrian stockholders and
unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Stockholder record date for the special meeting  

        The Spectrian board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 14, 2002 as the record date for determination of Spectrian stockholders entitled
to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were 11,476,052 shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding, held by approximately 213 holders of record. 

Majority vote of Spectrian stockholders required for adoption of the merger agreement  

        You are entitled to one vote for each share of Spectrian common stock held by you on the record date on each proposal to be presented to the Spectrian
stockholders at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. A majority of the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding as of the record date must be represented, either in person or
by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. Spectrian will count shares of its common stock represented in person or by proxy for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. Spectrian will also treat shares that abstain from voting as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the Spectrian
special meeting of stockholders for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

        The
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding on the record date is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and approve the merger. 

        On
the record date for the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, directors and executive officers of Spectrian and their affiliates beneficially held approximately
874,850 shares of Spectrian common stock representing approximately 7.1% of all outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock as of the record date. 

        All
of the Spectrian executive officers and directors have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a voting agreement with REMEC, to vote their shares of Spectrian common stock in
favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. As of the record date these stockholders held approximately 1,513,137 shares of Spectrian common stock
(including 684,668 shares of Spectrian common stock subject to unvested options) which are subject to the voting agreements representing approximately 11.7% of the outstanding shares of Spectrian
common stock as of the record date. 

Appraisal rights  

        If REMEC does not elect to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, you may not demand appraisal rights in
connection with the merger. 

        If
REMEC does elect to pay a portion of the aggregate merger consideration in cash, you are entitled to dissent from the proposed merger and demand appraisal of your shares of Spectrian
common stock. If you wish to dissent, you must follow the specific procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as described in detail in the section titled
"Rights of AppraisalSpectrian stockholders" on page 99. The full text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is also attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D. 

Proxies  

        All shares of Spectrian common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will be voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger. You are urged to mark a box on the proxy to indicate how to vote your shares. 

        If
a properly executed proxy is returned and the stockholder has instructed the proxies to abstain from voting on approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger, the Spectrian common stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be voted for or against the proposals
brought before the Spectrian stockholders, thereby having the effect of being a vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. If your shares are held
in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed
proxy card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or bank, which indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or discretionary authority to vote on the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to
have been voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
following the information provided to you by your broker or bank. 

        Because
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding on the
record date, 

abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

        Spectrian
does not expect that any matters other than approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be brought before the Spectrian special meeting of
stockholders. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is
withheld in the proxy. 

Revocability of proxies  

        Any proxy you give may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. You may revoke a proxy in one of the following
three ways: 


You
can send a signed written notice to the Secretary of Spectrian stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.


You
can complete and submit a new proxy.


You
can attend the special meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, however, will not revoke your proxy;
you must request a ballot and vote at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. 

        To
be effective, any written notice of revocation or any new proxy card must be received by Spectrian Corporation, 350 West Java Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089, Attention: Michael D.
Angel, Secretary,
prior to the time of the special meeting. Attendance at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders will not in and of itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. 

Adjournments  

        Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of the
shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the special meeting without further notice other than by an announcement at the special meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than 30 days or a new record date is fixed for the adjourned special meeting, a notice of the adjourned special meeting will be given to each Spectrian stockholder entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Spectrian does not currently intend to seek an adjournment of its special meeting unless such an adjournment is necessary to solicit additional votes. 

Solicitation of proxies  

        REMEC and Spectrian will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Spectrian will
also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Spectrian common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from,
the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means,
advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of Spectrian. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation. 

THE MERGER    

This section describes the merger, the merger agreement and the other agreements entered into by REMEC, Spectrian and their officers and
directors in connection with the merger. While REMEC and Spectrian believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and the other documents referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, such as the merger agreement, for a more complete
understanding of the merger.

Background of the merger  

        From time to time over the past several years, REMEC and Spectrian have engaged in informal discussions about a possible combination of the two companies. None of
these discussions, however, proceeded beyond informal discussions and all of these discussions concluded with no agreement with respect to a potential transaction. 

        Early
in 2001, the Spectrian board of directors authorized management to engage RBC to explore potential strategic transactions in which Spectrian might be acquired or would acquire
another company. In the course of RBC's efforts, representatives of RBC had contacted Ronald E. Ragland, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of REMEC, on February 6, 2001 regarding a
possible combination of REMEC and Spectrian. Subsequently, a representative from RBC, members of senior management of REMEC, Thomas H. Waechter, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Spectrian, and Michael D. Angel, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Spectrian, along with members of senior management of Spectrian,
had further discussions regarding possible strategic combination in February 2001. In connection with these discussions, Spectrian and REMEC entered into a nondisclosure agreement on
February 12, 2001. After the initial discussions described above, Spectrian and REMEC agreed to discontinue discussions. 

        In
February 2001, Messrs. Waechter and Angel and a representative of RBC met with another third party, the first potential acquirer, after which the first potential acquirer informed
Mr. Waechter that it did not intend to pursue further discussions at that time. However, in July and August 2001, Spectrian and RBC were subsequently contacted by the first potential
acquirer regarding a potential acquisition of Spectrian by that company. After discussions between Spectrian and the first potential acquirer
during which no indication of interest was provided by such first potential acquirer, the parties determined not to pursue further discussions. 

        Spectrian's
management and RBC continued their exploration of possible business combinations and other strategic transactions during the first half of 2001 and the Spectrian board of
directors considered a non-binding indication of interest relating to a potential acquisition of Spectrian by a third party, the second potential acquirer. After a number of discussions among the
second potential acquirer, its financial advisors, Spectrian and RBC, the parties determined not to pursue further discussions. 

        During
the remainder of 2001, Spectrian's management and RBC, with approval of the Spectrian board of directors, continued to pursue potential business combinations or other strategic
transactions. In August 2001, Mr. Waechter was contacted by a third potential acquirer and had several discussions with its chief executive officer. In November 2001,
Messrs. Waechter and Angel and representatives of RBC met with representatives of the third potential acquirer and its financial advisor. In December 2001, the financial advisor of the
third potential acquirer provided a non-binding indication of interest to RBC for the acquisition of Spectrian by that party. After conferring with Messrs. Waechter and Angel, RBC advised the
third potential acquirer that the proposed terms were not acceptable but that Spectrian would consider another indication of interest from the third potential acquirer. No further indications of
interest or other offers were received from that party. 

        On
December 12, 2001, a representative of Needham & Company, REMEC's financial advisor, met with Mr. Waechter. Based on the discussion that took place at the
meeting, Needham & Company arranged for a later meeting to take place in New York between Mr. Ragland and Mr. Waechter. 

        On
January 10, 2002, while in New York City, Mr. Ragland, David L. Morash, REMEC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Waechter,
accompanied by representatives of Needham & Company, met and discussed the possibility of resuming discussion regarding the combination of the companies. The discussions addressed, among other
matters, potential financial, business, operational and integration synergies. 

        In
January 2002, the Spectrian board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting at which representatives of RBC and Messrs. Waechter, Angel and Madden described the

with representatives of the fourth potential acquirer and its financial advisor in February 2002 at an investment banking conference to discuss the possible structure of a business combination
between the parties. In March 2002, Mr. Waechter and a representative of RBC met with representatives of the fourth potential acquirer and its financial advisor held a meeting to discuss
the possible benefits of a strategic transaction between Spectrian and the fourth potential acquirer. 

        In
March 2002, Mr. Madden was contacted by a fifth potential acquirer regarding a possible business combination with Spectrian. Messrs. Waechter and Madden met with
representatives of the fifth potential acquirer and its financial advisor to discuss the terms of a possible transaction and conduct due diligence at an industry conference in March 2002 but
the fifth potential acquirer provided no indication of interest relating to a potential acquisition of Spectrian at such time. 

        On
March 4, 2002, Nicholas J.S. Randall, REMEC's Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, presented to the REMEC board of directors a brief overview of a potential
business transaction with Spectrian. 

        Due
to the extensive travel schedules of the management teams of REMEC and Spectrian, Mr. Ragland and Mr. Waechter deferred further in person discussions until the end of
March 2002. However, during February and March 2002, Mr. Ragland and members of REMEC's senior management had several telephone discussions with Messrs. Waechter, Angel and Madden
regarding a potential business combination and due diligence. 

        Starting

companies. 

        In

acquirers advised RBC that it had no interest in pursuing further discussions.

the per share merger price (the price payable in shares of REMEC common stock and/or cash per share of Spectrian common stock under the exchange ratio provisions of, and the election and proration

REMEC's reasons for the merger  

        At a meeting held on May 16, 2002, the board of directors of REMEC unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement including the issuance of REMEC common stock in the merger. REMEC's board of directors concluded that the proposed merger and related transactions were fair to and in the best
interests of REMEC and its shareholders. In reaching its decision, the board of directors consulted with Needham & Company, Heller Ehrman, Ernst & Young LLP and with REMEC's
senior management. The REMEC board took into consideration a number of factors, including the following: 


the
opportunity to respond more fully to the needs of multiple markets and industries for RF products;


the
opportunity to develop and offer integrated solutions to the combined company's customer base;


the
opportunity to realize efficiencies in combined field sales and support teams to provide increased productivity and greater customer satisfaction;


the
opportunity to realize significant operational synergies;


the
opportunity to further pursue the global capabilities of REMEC and Spectrian;


the
opportunity to integrate engineering and technical resources to create greater productivity and broader product and service offerings;


the
additive effects of Spectrian's expanding, global customer relationships and complementary technology skills and capabilities;


the
anticipated integration of general, administrative and manufacturing overhead expenses;


the
anticipated enhanced revenues and balance sheet of the combined company; and 


the
opinion of Needham & Company that, as of May 19, 2002, and based on and subject to certain matters stated therein, the consideration to be
paid by REMEC in the merger was fair to REMEC from a financial point of view. 

        The
REMEC board also identified and considered a variety of potential risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, but not limited to: 


the
risk that the potential benefits and desired synergies sought in the merger might not be fully realized;


the
possibility that the merger might not be consummated;


the
possibility that integration may cost more and, take longer than anticipated and not be effective;


the
potential dilutive effect of the issuance of REMEC common stock in the merger;


the
substantial charges to expense to be incurred, primarily in the quarter ending September 27, 2002, in connection with the merger, including costs
of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from the merger; and


various
other risks. 

        The
REMEC board believed that these risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger. 

        In
view of the wide variety of the material factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the REMEC board of directors did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative weight to the various factors considered. In addition, the REMEC board of directors did not undertake to make
any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the REMEC board of directors, but
rather the REMEC board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including discussions with and questioning of REMEC's senior management and legal and financial
advisors. 

Recommendation of the REMEC board of directors  

        The REMEC board of directors unanimously believes that the terms of the merger are fair to and in the best interests of REMEC and its shareholders and recommends
to its shareholders that they vote "FOR" approval of the merger proposal. 

Opinion of financial advisor to REMEC  

        REMEC retained Needham & Company to furnish financial advisory and investment banking services with respect to the proposed merger and to render an opinion
as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to REMEC of the consideration to be paid by REMEC in the merger. The exchange ratio and the amount and form of consideration to be paid in the
merger was determined through arm's length negotiations between REMEC and Spectrian and not by Needham & Company, although Needham & Company assisted REMEC in these negotiations. 

        On
May 19, 2002, Needham & Company delivered to the REMEC board its written opinion that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions and other matters
described in the written opinion, the consideration to be paid by REMEC in the merger is fair to REMEC from a financial point of view. 
The Needham & Company opinion is
addressed to the REMEC board, is directed only to the financial terms of the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to any REMEC shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote
on, or take any other action relating to, the merger.

        The
complete text of the Needham & Company opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered, limitations on and scope of the review undertaken by
Needham & Company, is attached to this document as Annex B. The summary of the Needham & Company opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the Needham & Company opinion. 
You should read the Needham & Company opinion carefully and in its entirety for a description of the procedures
followed, the factors considered, and the assumptions made by Needham & Company.

        In
arriving at its opinion, Needham & Company, among other things: 


reviewed
a draft of the merger agreement;


reviewed
certain publicly available information concerning REMEC and Spectrian and certain other relevant financial and operating data of REMEC and Spectrian
furnished to Needham & Company by REMEC and Spectrian;


reviewed
the historical stock prices and trading volumes of REMEC common stock and Spectrian common stock;


held
discussions with members of management of REMEC and Spectrian concerning their current and future business prospects and joint prospects for the
combined company, including the potential cost savings and other synergies that may be achieved by the combined company;


reviewed
certain publicly available financial forecasts with respect to REMEC and Spectrian and certain financial forecasts prepared by the respective
managements of REMEC and Spectrian;


compared
certain publicly available financial data of companies whose securities are traded in the public markets and that Needham & Company deemed
relevant to similar data for Spectrian;


reviewed
the financial terms of certain other business combinations that Needham & Company deemed generally relevant; and


performed
and/or considered such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Needham & Company deemed appropriate. 

        Needham &
Company assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by or discussed with it for purposes of
rendering its opinion. Needham & Company assumed that the management financial forecasts relating to REMEC and Spectrian and information relating to the joint prospects of the combined company
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of REMEC and Spectrian, at the time of preparation, of the future operating and
financial performance of REMEC, Spectrian and the combined company. Needham & Company also assumed, based on discussions with REMEC and Spectrian management, that the publicly available
financial forecasts relating to REMEC and Spectrian represent reasonable estimates as to the future financial performance of REMEC and Spectrian. Needham & Company relied on estimates of management of
REMEC and Spectrian of the potential cost savings and other synergies that may be achieved as a result of the merger. Needham & Company did not assume any responsibility for or make or obtain
any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of, the assets or liabilities of REMEC or Spectrian. Needham & Company's opinion states that it was based on economic, monetary and
market conditions existing as of its date. Needham & Company expressed no opinion as to what the value of REMEC common stock will be when issued to the stockholders of Spectrian pursuant to the
merger or the prices at which the REMEC common stock will actually trade at any time. Needham & Company expressed no opinion as to the proration procedures in the merger agreement. In addition,
Needham & Company was not asked to consider, and the Needham & Company opinion does not address, REMEC's underlying business decision to engage in the merger, 

the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might exist for REMEC, or the effect of any other transaction in which REMEC might engage. 

        No
limitations were imposed by REMEC on Needham & Company with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by Needham & Company in rendering its opinion. 

        In
preparing its opinion, Needham & Company performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The following paragraphs summarize the material financial analyses performed
by Needham & Company in arriving at its opinion. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and
in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Needham & Company, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. 

        Contribution Analysis.
    Needham & Company reviewed and analyzed the pro forma contribution of
each of REMEC and Spectrian to pro forma combined balance sheet information, pro forma operating results for the last twelve months and pro forma projected calendar 2002 and 2003 combined operating
results. In calculating the pro forma combined balance sheet information, Needham & Company used REMEC's January 31, 2002 balance sheet and Spectrian's March 31, 2002 balance
sheet, and in calculating the pro forma operating results for the last twelve months, Needham & Company used REMEC's operating results for the twelve months ended January 31, 2002 and
Spectrian's operating results for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002. In calculating the pro forma projected combined operating results, Needham & Company used financial forecasts
prepared by REMEC and Spectrian management and assumed no cost savings or other synergies. Needham & Company reviewed, among
other things, the pro forma contributions to revenues, net income, assets and stockholders' equity. This analysis indicated that Spectrian would have contributed 


64.7%
of pro forma combined cash,


31.9%
of pro forma combined total assets,


26.3%
of pro forma combined shareholders' equity, and


30.4%
of pro forma combined tangible book value. 

        This
analysis also indicated that Spectrian would have contributed or would contribute the percentages shown in the following table of 


last
twelve months, or LTM, projected calendar 2002 and projected calendar 2003 pro forma combined revenues, and


LTM,
projected calendar 2002 and projected calendar 2003 pro forma combined gross margin.

        Information
as to relative contributions to earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes and net income was not meaningful due to Spectrian's actual and projected losses for
the periods in question. The results of the contribution analysis are not necessarily indicative of the contributions that the respective businesses may have in the future. 

        Based
on the exchange ratio calculated using the closing price of REMEC common stock on May 17, 2002 of $8.13, Spectrian's stockholders will own approximately 30.3% of REMEC after
the merger, if REMEC elects to issue all of the merger consideration in shares of REMEC common stock, and 23.7% of REMEC, if REMEC elects to pay $4.00 per share in cash as partial consideration in the
merger. 

        Selected Company Analysis.
    Using publicly available information, Needham & Company compared
selected historical and projected financial and market data ratios for Spectrian to the corresponding data and ratios of certain other publicly traded companies that Needham & Company deemed
relevant because their lines of businesses are similar to Spectrian's line of business. These companies, referred to as the selected companies, consisted of: 

Allen Telecom Inc.

Filtronic plc

Allgon AB

LGP Telecom Holding AB

Anaren Microwave, Inc.

Powerwave Technologies, Inc.

Andrew Corporation

        Accretion/Dilution Analysis.
    Needham & Company reviewed various pro forma financial impacts of
the merger on the holders of REMEC and Spectrian common stock based on a value of the merger consideration of $14.00 per share of Spectrian common stock and estimated financial results of REMEC and
Spectrian for calendar years 2002 and 2003 and assuming certain operating and other cost savings resulting from the merger. The estimated financial results and operating and other cost savings
assumptions were based upon REMEC and Spectrian management estimates. Based upon these projections and assumptions, Needham & Company noted that the merger would result in accretion to 

the projected earnings per share of REMEC common stock for calendar years 2002 and 2003. The actual operating or financial results achieved by the combined entity may vary from projected results, and
these variations may be material. 

        Selected Transaction Analysis.
    Needham & Company analyzed publicly available financial
information for the following selected mergers and acquisitions of technology companies that represent transactions since January 1, 2000 involving companies engaged in businesses that were
deemed generally comparable to Spectrian's business:

Microwave Power Devices, Inc.

        In
examining the selected transactions, Needham & Company analyzed: 


the
enterprise value as a multiple of revenues for the last twelve months revenues and


market
value as a multiple of historical book value. 

        Needham
& Company also analyzed, for the selected transactions, 


the
enterprise value as a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes for the last twelve months,


the
enterprise value as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the last twelve months and


market
value as a multiple of net income for the last twelve months, 

but
determined that the results were not meaningful because of Spectrian's net losses for the last twelve months. In some cases, complete financial data was not publicly available for the selected
transactions and only partial information was used in such instances. 

        Needham &
Company calculated multiples for Spectrian based on a merger consideration of $14.00 per share of Spectrian common stock, the value based on the exchange ratio using the
closing price of REMEC common stock on May 17, 2002 of $8.13, and by using an enterprise value for Spectrian based on net cash of $65.0 million at closing. 

        The
following table sets forth information concerning the multiples of aggregate transaction value to LTM revenues and the multiples of market value to historical book value for the

company, transaction or business used in the "Selected Company Analysis," "Selected Transaction Analysis," or "Stock Price Premium Analysis" as a comparison is identical to REMEC,
Spectrian or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
the financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the selected companies or selected transactions or the business
segment, company or transaction to which they are being compared. 

        Other Analyses.
    In rendering its opinion, Needham & Company considered various other analyses,
including a history of trading prices and volumes for REMEC and Spectrian and an analysis of the exchange ratio based on historical trading prices for REMEC common stock. 

        The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Needham & Company in connection with the rendering of its opinion. The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant quantitative and qualitative methods of financial analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Accordingly, Needham & Company believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses or the factors it considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In
its analyses, Needham & Company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of REMEC
and Spectrian. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable.
Additionally, analyses relating to the values of businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold. Accordingly,
these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Needham & Company's opinion and its related analyses were only one of many factors considered by REMEC's board of
directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of REMEC's board of directors or management with respect to the exchange ratio, the
consideration to be paid by REMEC or the merger. 

        Under
the terms of the Needham & Company engagement letter, REMEC has paid or agreed to pay Needham & Company a nonrefundable fee for rendering the Needham & Company
opinion and a fee for financial advisory services that REMEC and Needham & Company believe are customary in transactions of this nature. A substantial portion of Needham & Company's
fees, consisting of the fee for financial advisory services, are contingent on consummation of the merger. Whether or not the merger is consummated, REMEC has agreed to reimburse Needham &
Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify it against specified liabilities relating to or arising out of services performed by Needham & Company
as a financial advisor to REMEC. 

        Needham &
Company is a nationally recognized investment banking firm. As part of its investment banking services, Needham & Company is frequently engaged in the evaluation
of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private placements and other purposes. Needham &
Company was retained by the REMEC board of directors to act as REMEC's financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Needham & Company's experience as a financial advisor in mergers
and acquisitions as well as Needham & Company's familiarity with technology companies. Needham & Company has in the past and may in the future provide investment banking and financial
advisory services to REMEC unrelated to the proposed merger, for which services Needham & Company has received and expects to receive compensation. In the normal course of its business,
Needham & Company may actively trade the equity securities of REMEC or Spectrian for its own account or for the account of its customers and, therefore, may at any time hold a long or short
position in these securities. 

Spectrian's reasons for the merger  

        After careful consideration, the Spectrian board of directors has unanimously concluded that the merger agreement is advisable, and that the terms of the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Spectrian and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Spectrian stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and
approve the merger. This decision was
based upon a number of potential benefits of the merger that the Spectrian board of directors believes will contribute to the success of the combined company compared to Spectrian continuing to
operate as an independent business, including the following: 


the
Spectrian board's judgment that the two companies have significant complementary strengths and complementary products;


the
Spectrian board's judgment that important advantages will accrue to the leading provider of integrated wireless base stations and that in order to
achieve and retain this position a merchant provider must offer a broad line of base station filters;


the
combined company's potential to be a market leader as a provider of RF subassemblies in the rapidly developing and highly competitive wireless base
station market by offering a full line of base station filters and power amplifiers to large, medium and small wireless network operators and original equipment manufacturers of wireless base station
infrastructure components;


the
combined company's potential to leverage global presence in sales, support and alliances through REMEC's extensive sales force, strong service
organization and the combined company's developed customer bases;


the
combined company's potential to achieve synergies by utilizing REMEC's low cost manufacturing facilities to produce Spectrian's power amplifier products;


the
potential that REMEC's larger market capitalization, broad suite of base station filter products and historical revenue growth will provide Spectrian
with additional resources to grow and gain market share more rapidly than Spectrian can grow as an independent company in the rapidly evolving merchant power amplifier market, which has been
characterized by the consolidation of small, independent providers with larger, integrated competitors;


that
based on the prices of Spectrian and REMEC common stock at the time the merger agreement was approved by the Spectrian board of directors, the
approximate $14.00 price per share was a premium over the price of Spectrian common stock then prevailing in the market; 


the
all or partial stock consideration provides an opportunity for Spectrian's stockholders to participate in the future growth in value of the combined
company as stockholders of REMEC following the merger;


the
liquidity afforded Spectrian stockholders upon exchange of their shares of Spectrian common stock for shares of REMEC common stock, which trade in higher
dollar and share volumes;


the
Spectrian board's judgment that the common stock of the combined company may be a more valuable currency to finance future acquisitions at a faster pace
and at less dilutive prices than Spectrian could accomplish with its stock alone; and


the
presence on the combined company's board of directors of two members of the Spectrian board of directors which will enable the former Spectrian directors
to continue to participate in the deliberations and decisions of the combined company. 

        In
identifying these benefits and evaluating the merger, the Spectrian board of directors reviewed a number of factors and sources of information, including the following: 


historical
information concerning Spectrian and REMEC and their respective businesses, financial performance, condition, operations, technology, management
and position in their respective industries, and information and evaluations regarding the two companies' strengths, weaknesses and prospects, both before and after giving effect to the merger;


the
potential effect on stockholder value of Spectrian continuing as an independent entity, compared to the potential effect of a combination with REMEC in
light of the financial condition and prospects of Spectrian and the current economic climate in general and in Spectrian's markets including, but not limited to, (A) the other possible
strategic alternatives the Spectrian board examined, including Spectrian continuing to execute its stand-alone business plan, and (B) the potential for increased value in the combined company
as compared to either Spectrian or REMEC alone;


the
presentations of Spectrian's financial advisor, RBC, of its financial analysis in support of its opinion and RBC's opinion (which is attached to this
document as Annex C) to the effect that, as of May 18, 2002, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the per share merger price
(the price payable in shares of REMEC common stock and/or cash per share of Spectrian common stock under the exchange ratio provisions of, and the election and proration procedures established by, the
merger agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Spectrian common stock;


current
financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information for Spectrian common stock and REMEC common stock, and
various factors that might affect the market value of REMEC common stock in the future;


the
premium represented by the exchange ratio and the premiums paid in other recent transactions that could be viewed as comparable, as well as the
negotiations between Spectrian and REMEC relating to the price per share, collar and exchange ratio;


the
alternatives available to Spectrian and the history of contacts with other parties concerning their possible interest in a business combination with
Spectrian; and


the
terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, by themselves and in comparison to the terms of other transactions, and the intensive negotiations
between REMEC and Spectrian, including their negotiations relating to the details of the conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger, the details of the "no shop" restrictions on
Spectrian and the scope of Spectrian's fiduciary out from these restrictions, the parties' termination rights, the termination 

fee
that Spectrian may be required to pay REMEC in certain circumstances and the voting agreements. 

        The
Spectrian board of directors also identified and considered a number of risks and uncertainties in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the following: 


the
fact that (A) the price per share is subject to a collar between $7.00 and $10.50 per share of REMEC common stock, (B) REMEC may elect to
pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, (C) the possibility that the dollar value of a share of REMEC stock at the closing of the merger may be less than the dollar value of a share
of REMEC stock at the signing of the merger agreement and (D) the per share actual consideration may not be $14.00 due to the collar;


the
fact that pursuant to the merger agreement, Spectrian is required to obtain REMEC's consent before it can take a variety of actions between the signing
and the closing of the merger;


the
possibility that the merger may not be consummated and the affect of the public announcement of the merger on Spectrian's sales, customer relations and
operating results and Spectrian's ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel;


the
risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical, marketing and management personnel might not choose to remain employed by the
combined company;


the
risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the merger may not be fully realized, if at all;


the
risk of customer hesitation about the impact of the merger on Spectrian's product design and manufacturing processes and potential delay or reduction in
orders; and


various
other risks associated with the businesses of Spectrian, REMEC and the combined company and the merger described under the section entitled "Risk
Factors" beginning on page 23 of this document. 

        The
Spectrian board of directors concluded, however, that many of these risks could be managed or mitigated by Spectrian or by the combined company or were unlikely to have a material
impact on the merger or the combined company, and that, overall, the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger were outweighed by the potential
benefits of the merger. 

        The
foregoing discussion of information and factors considered and given weight by the Spectrian board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Spectrian board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. 

Recommendation of the Spectrian board of directors  

        For the reasons discussed above, the Spectrian board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and has determined that the merger
agreement is advisable and the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Spectrian and its stockholders. The Spectrian board of directors unanimously
recommends that Spectrian stockholders vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

        In
considering the recommendation of the Spectrian board of directors with respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers of Spectrian have certain
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Spectrian stockholders generally as 

discussed below in the section titled "The MergerInterests of certain persons in the merger" on page 65. 

Opinion of financial advisor to Spectrian  

        On May 18, 2002, RBC rendered its written opinion to the Spectrian board of directors that, as of that date and subject to the assumptions, qualifications
and limitations set forth in its opinion, the per share merger price, as defined below, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Spectrian stockholders. The full text of the opinion of RBC is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. This summary of the opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion by RBC. Spectrian
stockholders are urged to read the RBC opinion carefully and in its entirety. 

        RBC's
opinion was provided for the information and assistance of the Spectrian board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. RBC's opinion did not address
Spectrian's underlying business decision to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger compared to any alternative business strategy or transaction in which Spectrian might engage.
RBC's opinion and presentation to the Spectrian board of directors were only two of many factors taken into consideration by the Spectrian board of directors in making its determination to adopt and
approve the merger agreement and approve the merger. RBC's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to Spectrian stockholders as to how they should vote on the adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the approval of the merger. 

        RBC's
opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger price to the Spectrian stockholders and does not address any other terms or
agreements related to the merger. As used in this section and the opinion of RBC, the term "per share merger price" refers to the price payable in shares of REMEC common stock and/or cash per share of
Spectrian common stock under the exchange ratio provisions of, and the election and proration procedures established by, the merger agreement. 

        In
rendering its opinion, RBC assumed and relied upon the accuracy and (except as noted below) completeness of the financial, legal, tax, operating, and other information provided to it
by Spectrian and REMEC, including, without limitation, the financial statements and related notes of Spectrian and REMEC. RBC did not assume responsibility for independently verifying, and did not
independently verify, this information. RBC assumed that the financial forecasts of Spectrian and REMEC, including the forecasts prepared by industry research analysts, have been reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the respective managements of
Spectrian and REMEC. RBC expressed no opinion as to those financial forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. RBC did not assume any responsibility to perform, and did not perform, an
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the respective assets or liabilities of Spectrian or REMEC, and RBC was not furnished with any valuations or appraisals of these types. In addition, RBC
did not assume any obligation to conduct, and did not conduct, any physical inspection of the property or facilities of Spectrian or REMEC. Additionally, RBC was not asked to, and did not consider,
the possible effects of any litigation or other legal claims. 

        In
rendering its opinion, RBC assumed that the merger would be accounted for by REMEC as a purchase transaction under generally accepted accounting principles and would qualify as a
tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. RBC also assumed that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without waiver. In addition, in
arriving at its opinion, RBC assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, will be imposed that
would have a material effect on the combined company. 

        The
opinion of RBC speaks only as of the date it was rendered, is based on the conditions as they existed and information which it was supplied as of such date, and is without regard to
any market, economic, financial, legal or other circumstances or event of any kind or nature which may exist or occur after such date. Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were performed based on
market information available as of May 16, 2002 (the last trading day preceding the finalization of RBC's analysis). 

        The
opinion of RBC addresses solely the fairness of the per share merger price, from a financial point of view, to the Spectrian stockholders. The opinion does not in any way address
other merger terms or arrangements, including, without limitation, the financial or other terms of any voting or employment agreement. RBC did not express any opinion as to the prices at which
Spectrian's or REMEC's common stock have traded or may trade following the announcement or consummation of the merger. 

        In
connection with its review of the merger and the preparation of its opinion, RBC undertook the review and inquiries it deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances,
including: 


reviewing
the financial terms of the draft dated May 18, 2002 of the merger agreement;


reviewing
and analyzing certain publicly available financial and other data with respect to Spectrian and REMEC and certain other relevant historical
operating data relating to Spectrian and REMEC made available to RBC from published sources and from the internal records of Spectrian and REMEC;


conducting
discussions with members of the senior management of Spectrian with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Spectrian;


conducting
discussions with members of the senior management of REMEC with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of REMEC and the combined
company;


receiving
and reviewing financial forecasts prepared by Spectrian's and REMEC's management on the potential future performance of the applicable company,
respectively, each on a stand alone basis, and compared such forecasts with publicly available institutional investment research estimates;


reviewing
the reported prices and trading activity for the common stock of each of Spectrian and REMEC; and


reviewing
selected market valuation metrics of REMEC and other comparable publicly-traded companies. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, in addition to reviewing the matters listed above, RBC performed the following analyses: 


RBC
compared selected market valuation metrics of Spectrian and other comparable publicly-traded companies with the metrics implied by the per share merger
price;


RBC
compared the financial metrics, to the extent publicly available, of selected precedent transactions with the metrics implied by the per share merger
price;


RBC
compared the historical exchange ratios between Spectrian common stock and REMEC common stock with the exchange ratio provisions of the merger agreement;
and


RBC
compared the premium implied by the per share merger price relative to recent trading activity and historical exchange ratios with the premiums paid in
selected precedent transactions. 

        In
performing these analyses, RBC used $14.00 as the value of the per share merger price, having regard to the exchange ratio provisions of the merger agreement and the trading value of
REMEC common stock as of May 16, 2002 (the last trading day preceding the finalization of its analysis). 

        In
connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Spectrian board of directors, RBC prepared and delivered to the Spectrian board of directors written materials containing the
analyses listed above and other information material to the opinion. Set forth below is a summary of these analyses, including information presented in tabular format. To fully understand the summary
of the analyses used by RBC, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analysis. 

        Comparable Company Analysis.
    RBC prepared a comparable company analysis to analyze Spectrian's
implied transaction valuation relative to a group of publicly-traded companies that RBC deemed for purposes of its analysis to be comparable to Spectrian. In this analysis, RBC compared the enterprise
value of Spectrian implied by the per share merger price, expressed as a multiple of actual and projected revenue in calendar 2001 and 2002, to the respective low/high range, mean and median multiples
enterprise value to revenue multiples of comparable companies implied by the public trading price of their common stock. Future revenue and earnings for Spectrian and for the comparable companies used
in the analyses were based on publicly available estimates. In addition, RBC compared the market capitalization or equity value of Spectrian implied by the per share merger price, expressed as a
multiple of price to earnings in calendar 2001 and 2002, to the respective low/high range, mean and median price to earnings multiples of comparable companies implied by the public trading price of
their common stock. For the purposes of RBC's analyses, enterprise value was defined as market capitalization plus debt less cash and cash equivalents. 

        RBC
compared enterprise value to revenue multiples and price to earnings multiples of Spectrian's implied valuation with those of the following publicly-traded companies:

        Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis.
    RBC compared enterprise value to revenue and EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples and transaction value (equity value) to earnings multiples relating to the proposed merger of Spectrian and REMEC with like
multiples in selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions. In selecting precedent transactions, RBC considered comparable publicly-traded company transactions completed after
January 1, 2000. Based on these criteria, the following five transactions were analyzed: 

Acquirer

Target

Andrew Corporation

Celiant Corporation

Allen Telecom Inc.

Bartley R.F. Systems, Inc.

Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

MPD Technologies, Inc. (RF amplifier lines)

Ericsson LM Tel. Co. Ad.

Microwave Power Devices, Inc.

TriPoint Global Communications Inc.

Vertex Communications Corporation

        For
the purpose of calculating the multiples, revenue and EBITDA were derived from the twelve month actual revenue and EBITDA of the target companies in the last twelve months prior to
the announcement of the transaction, or LTM revenue and LTM EBITDA, respectively. Financial data regarding the precedent transactions was taken from filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, press releases, RBC institutional investment research, and other institutional investment research estimates. RBC also noted the overall level of the market as defined by the Nasdaq
(NAS/NMS Composite) in discussing the relative valuation of the comparable transactions with this transaction.

        Exchange Ratio Analysis.
    RBC derived the implied exchange ratio between REMEC common stock and
Spectrian common stock during the period between May 18, 2001 and May 16, 2002 by comparing the
closing prices of the two securities on each trading day during that period, with particular focus on the implied exchange ratio that RBC derived based on the nine-month,
six-month, three-month and one-month average historical implied exchange ratios during that period. RBC compared this implied historical exchange ratio data to the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger agreement, using for this purpose both the minimum exchange ratio of 1.33333 and the maximum exchange ratio of 2.00000. 

        The
following table compares the implied historical exchange ratio between REMEC common stock and Spectrian common stock, using the nine-month, six-month,
three-month and one-month averages referred to above, to the minimum and maximum exchange ratio for the merger:

        Premiums Paid Analysis (Premiums to Price).
    RBC compared the premium implied by the per share merger
price to the premiums in 77 public-to-public technology transactions announced since January 1, 2000 in which the transaction values ranged between $100 million
and $500 million. RBC compared the per share merger price (using $14.00 per share for this purpose) to Spectrian's spot price one day (May 16, 2002) and Spectrian's spot and average
price one week (May 10, 2002) and one month (April 17, 2002) prior to May 16, 2002 to the spot price premiums for the same periods for the targets in the selected transactions.
RBC took into account that the one month premium was less relevant
because Spectrian announced its quarterly earnings in that time period and, subsequently, Spectrian common stock traded lower. The following table summarizes this analysis:

        Premiums Paid Analysis (Premiums to Exchange Ratio).
    RBC compared the exchange ratio premium implied
by the per share merger price to the premiums in 33 public-to-public technology stock-for-stock transactions announced since January 1, 2000 in
which the transaction values ranged between $100 million and $500 million. RBC compared the exchange ratio implied by the per share merger price and REMEC's May 16, 2002 stock
price and REMEC's stock price at the maximum exchange ratio and minimum exchange ratio to the implied Spectrian/REMEC spot exchange ratio one day (May 16, 2002) and the implied Spectrian/REMEC
spot and average exchange ratios one week (May 10, 2002) and one
month (April 17, 2002) prior to May 16, 2002 to the spot price exchange ratios for the same periods for the selected transactions. The following table summarizes this analysis:

        Premiums Paid Analysis (Premiums to PriceTarget Stockholders Ownership Percentage in Combined
Entity).
    RBC took into account that premiums realized in selected historical transactions demonstrated an inverse relationship with the target stockholders'
aggregate ownership percentage in the combined entity, such that transactions with target stockholders owning greater than 40% in the aggregate yielded a lower premium than transactions with target
stockholders owning 20%-40% in the aggregate, which in turn yielded a lower premium than transactions with target stockholders owning less than 20% in the aggregate. On a fully diluted
basis, Spectrian stockholders would hold between approximately 27% and 36% of the combined entity in the aggregate. Therefore, RBC compared the premium implied by the per share merger to the premiums
in 93 public-to-public transactions announced since January 1, 2001 in which the transaction values were greater than $50 million and in which the target
stockholders would own between 20% and 40% of the combined entity. RBC compared Spectrian common stock price on May 16, 2002 implied by the per share merger price to Spectrian's spot price one
day (May 16, 2002) and Spectrian's spot and average price one week (May 10, 2002) and one month (April 17, 2002) prior to announcement to the spot price premiums for the same
periods for the targets in the selected transactions. The following table summarizes this analysis:

        Other Considerations.
    No single company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is
identical to Spectrian or REMEC or the proposed merger. The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of RBC providing an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Spectrian
stockholders of the per share merger price and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to
uncertainty. RBC did not employ a discounted cash flow analysis because of the unavailability of complete forecasted financial information for Spectrian beyond March 2003. In addition, because
Spectrian and REMEC have incurred operating losses in recent fiscal periods and are projecting losses in future fiscal periods, RBC did not rely on a contribution analysis or an earnings accretion
(dilution) analysis in reaching its opinion. 

        The
opinion of RBC as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger price, was necessarily based upon market, economic, and other conditions that existed as of
the date of its opinion and on information available to RBC as of that date. 

        The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Several analytical methodologies were used by RBC and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical
to the overall conclusion reached. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques.
The overall conclusions of RBC were based on all the analyses and factors presented herein taken as a whole and also on application of RBC's own experience and judgment. Such conclusions may involve
significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. RBC therefore believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the analyses and of the
factors considered, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the processes underlying its opinion. 

        In
connection with its analyses, RBC made, and was provided by Spectrian's and REMEC's management with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Spectrian's or REMEC's control. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of Spectrian, REMEC or their advisors, none of Spectrian, REMEC, RBC or any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts
or assumptions. 

        Spectrian
selected RBC to act as its financial advisor, and render its opinion, based on RBC's experience in mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuation generally. RBC is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings,
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, RBC may act as a
market maker and broker in the publicly traded securities of Spectrian and REMEC and receive customary compensation in connection, therewith. RBC also may actively trade Spectrian and REMEC securities
for its own account and the accounts of its customers, and, accordingly, may hold a long or short position in such securities. 

        Under
the terms of the RBC engagement letter, Spectrian paid RBC a nonrefundable fee upon the rendering of its opinion, a portion of which is creditable against the transaction fee.
Payment of this opinion fee was not contingent on the closing of the merger. Spectrian has also agreed to pay a transaction fee for investment banking and financial advisory services. The transaction
fee is contingent on the closing of the merger. Spectrian and RBC believe that the opinion fee and transaction fee are customary for transactions of this nature. Whether or not the merger closes,
Spectrian has also agreed 

to reimburse RBC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify it against liabilities relating to or arising out of services performed by RBC in connection with
the merger, including without limitation, liabilities arising under the federal securities laws. The terms of the engagement
letter were negotiated at arm's-length between Spectrian and RBC and the Spectrian board of directors was aware of this fee arrangement at the time of its adoption and approval of the merger agreement
and approval of the merger. 

Interests of certain persons in the merger  

        In considering the recommendation of Spectrian's board of directors with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,
you should be aware that certain members of the management of Spectrian and Spectrian's board of directors may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests.
Spectrian's board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among others, in approving and adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger. 

 General  

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, REMEC will assume each outstanding Spectrian stock option other than options granted under Spectrian's 1994 Director Option
Plan. Spectrian employees, including its officers, will also be able to participate in REMEC's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

 Non-employee directors  

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, REMEC will not assume any of the outstanding stock options under Spectrian's 1994 Director Option Plan. Pursuant to the terms of
Spectrian's 1994 Director Option Plan, all unvested options that are not assumed by REMEC will become immediately exercisable and vested upon the closing of the merger. Of the options for the
117,500 shares of Spectrian common stock expected to be outstanding under Spectrian's 1994 Director Option Plan immediately prior to the closing of the merger, assuming that the merger closes
on August 31, 2002, options for approximately 40,622 shares of common stock will then be unvested and subject to immediate acceleration at a weighted average exercise price of $11.41. 

        On
May 18, 2002, Spectrian amended all of the outstanding options under its 1994 Director Option Plan to provide that each of the non-employee directors who has
outstanding grants under the 1994 Director Option Plan, will have nine months from the date of the closing of the merger to exercise his Spectrian options. Each of the following Spectrian board
members holds options outstanding under the 1994 Director Option Plan: Martin A. Cooper, Henry C. Montgomery, Robert Shaner, Charles Kissner and Robert C. Wilson. The outstanding options under the
1994 Director Option Plan previously provided for an exercisability period of 90 days following a change of control. 

 Executive Officers  

        As of the record date, Spectrian's executive officers held options to purchase an aggregate of 1,096,637 shares of Spectrian common stock at a weighted average
exercise price of $17.00 per share. Spectrian has entered into change of control and severance agreements with each of: Thomas H. Waechter, Michael D. Angel, Thomas A. Jones, David Piazza, Joseph M.
Madden, Harry W. Oh, Donald W. Sinnar and Robert Lyells. Each of the Spectrian officers may be entitled to accelerated vesting benefits as a result of the merger. In the event that any of the above
Spectrian officers is subject to involuntary termination (as defined in the change of control and severance agreements) at any time after the closing of the merger, among other things, his outstanding
options will become fully vested. The change of control and severance agreements for Messrs. Waechter, Angel, Jones, Piazza, Madden, Oh, Sinnar and Lyells provide in general that a termination
is an involuntary termination if (A) REMEC were to terminate the officer's employment without cause (as defined in the change of 

control and severance agreements) or (B) the officer were to terminate his employment for any of the following reasons: 


a
significant reduction in the facilities and perquisites available to him;


a
reduction in his base salary;


a
material reduction in kind or level of his benefits;


his
relocation to a facility more than 35 miles away from his current location; and


the
failure of the REMEC to assume his change of control and severance agreement. 

        In
addition to the requirements listed above, Mr. Waechter's change of control and severance agreement also provides that a termination may be deemed an involuntary termination if
Mr. Waechter were to terminate his employment with REMEC due to: 


a
reduction in his target bonus; or


a
significant reduction of his duties, position or responsibilities in effect prior to the effectiveness of the merger or his removal from such duties or
position unless he is provided with comparable duties, position and responsibilities as the chief executive officer of REMEC and he reports directly to REMEC's board of directors. 

        In
connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement and the merger, Mr. Waechter has entered into an employment agreement with REMEC that will supersede his change of
control and severance agreement with Spectrian upon the closing of the merger. See "Employment arrangements with REMEC" below. 

        In
addition to the requirements listed above, Mr. Angel's change of control and severance agreement provides that a termination may be deemed an involuntary termination if
Mr. Angel were to terminate his employment with REMEC due to: 


a
reduction in his target bonus; or


a
significant reduction of his duties, position or responsibilities in effect prior to the effectiveness of the merger or his removal from such duties or
position unless he is provided with comparable duties, position and responsibilities as the chief financial officer of REMEC and he reports directly to the chief executive officer of REMEC. 

        In
addition to the requirements listed above, the change of control and severance agreements for Messrs. Jones, Piazza, Madden, Oh, Sinnar and Lyells also provide that a
termination may be deemed involuntary if the officer were to terminate his employment with REMEC due to a significant reduction of the officer's duties, position or responsibilities or the removal of
the officer from such duties or position unless he is provided with comparable duties and position. Mr. Jones' change of control and severance agreement also deems a reduction in
Mr. Jones' target bonus to be an involuntary termination. In connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement and the merger, Messrs. Jones and Piazza have entered into employment
agreements with REMEC that will supersede their respective change of control and severance agreements with Spectrian. See "Employment arrangements with REMEC" below. 

        On
May 18, 2002 Spectrian amended the change of control and severance agreements of each of its officers to provide that, effective upon the consummation of the merger, any
officer who is subject to involuntary termination at any time after the closing of the merger will have nine months from the date of his involuntary termination to exercise his stock options. The
change of control and severance agreements previously provided for 90 days following an involuntary termination to exercise stock options. 

        The following table summarizes the benefits available to the officers of Spectrian pursuant to the terms of their respective change of control and severance agreements assuming that the
merger closes on August 31, 2002:

 Employment arrangements with REMEC  

        In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, on May 19, 2002, Mr. Waechter, Spectrian's President and Chief Executive Officer, entered
into an employment agreement with REMEC, which will become effective upon the closing of the merger. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Waechter will become the President and Chief
Operating Officer of REMEC upon the closing of the merger. Mr. Waechter has also agreed to waive his rights under his agreements with Spectrian upon the closing of the merger, and REMEC will
pay Mr. Waechter $1,000,000 in cash (subject to applicable tax withholding) upon the closing of the merger as consideration for the waiver of the approximately $1,600,000 in payments he would
have been entitled to receive under his change of control agreement. Because this amount, plus other compensation paid to Mr. Waechter, may exceed the $1,000,000 limit on deductions of
compensation paid to certain officers under the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of this payment is expected to be nondeductible. REMEC will pay Mr. Waechter an annual base salary of $375,000
and an annual target bonus of 30% of his annual base salary provided Mr. Waechter achieves certain objectives. Mr. Waechter will relocate to REMEC's Del Mar, California offices, and
REMEC will reimburse him for all actual relocation expenses, including closing costs on the sale and purchase of his home. Mr. Waechter will receive a tax gross up payment to cover any federal,
state and local income and employment taxes with respect to his relocation expenses as well as on this gross up payment. Mr. Waechter will also be reimbursed for the reasonable cost of a
country club membership and he will receive a $9,000 annual car allowance and six weeks of vacation a year. REMEC will grant Mr. Waechter an option to purchase 100,000 shares of REMEC's common
stock immediately after he becomes an employee of REMEC. 

        Mr. Waechter's
employment agreement provides that if in the first three years of his employment with REMEC, he is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, then he is
entitled to receive: 


payment
of his base salary as in effect at the time of termination, 100% of his targeted bonus and employee benefits for three years after his termination; 


accelerated
vesting of all of his options which were assumed by REMEC in connection with the merger to the extent that such options would vest in the three
year severance period if he had remained an employee of REMEC; and


accelerated
vesting of all his options which were granted after the closing of the merger to the extent that such options would vest in the year following
Mr. Waechter's termination date assuming he had remained an employee of REMEC. 

        Mr. Waechter's
employment agreement also provides that if he is still employed at REMEC on the date of a change of control of REMEC, he will receive: 


accelerated
vesting of all his options that were assumed by REMEC in connection with the Spectrian merger to the extent that such options would vest in the
three years following the date of the change of control and


accelerated
vesting of all his options that were granted after the closing of the merger to the extent that such options would vest in the year following the
date of the change of control. 

        In
the event Mr. Waechter is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within two years following a change of control of REMEC, then Mr. Waechter will also be
entitled to receive: 


payment
of his base salary as in effect at the time of termination, 100% of his targeted bonus and employee benefits for three years after his termination
and


accelerated
vesting of all his options. 

        Mr. Waechter's
employment agreement defines a "change of control" as: 


the
approval by REMEC's shareholders of a merger or consolidation with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the
voting securities of REMEC outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent more than 50% of the total voting power of the surviving entity;


the
approval of REMEC's shareholders of a plan of liquidation or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of REMEC;


any
person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of REMEC's outstanding voting securities; and


a
change in the composition of REMEC board of directors as a result of which less than a majority of the directors are incumbent directors. 

        Mr. Waechter's
employment agreement defines "for good reason" as the occurrence of any of the following unless expressly consented to by Mr. Waechter: 


a
significant reduction of his duties, position or responsibilities or his removal from such duties or position unless he is provided with comparable duties,
position and responsibilities;


a
substantial reduction, without good business reason, in the facilities and perquisites available to him;


a
reduction in his base salary or target bonus as in effect immediately prior to such reduction;


a
material reduction in kind or level of his benefits;


his
relocation to a facility more than 35 miles away from REMEC's Del Mar, California offices;


any
termination without cause or for which the grounds are not valid; and


REMEC's
failure to obtain the assumption of his employment agreement by a successor entity. 

        Mr. Waechter's
employment agreement also provides for the imposition of a "best-of" provision with respect to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, or any similar tax, if Mr. Waechter's employment with REMEC is terminated without cause or for good reason within three years of the closing date of the merger or within two years
after a change of control of REMEC. Upon the occurrence of either of these events, the benefits received by Mr. Waechter under his employment agreement will be paid at his election either in
full or in such lesser amount such that the excise tax
associated with Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code will not apply with respect to the receipt of such benefits. 

        In
order to receive his severance payments and benefits during the three year severance period following his termination, Mr. Waechter has agreed not to engage in any activity
which is deemed to be in competition with REMEC's business. Mr. Waechter has also agreed, for a 12 month period after the termination of his employment with REMEC for any reason, to not
solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee to leave his or her employment with REMEC. Mr. Waechter also released REMEC from any and all claims or any liability for severance benefits or
stock acceleration except as set for in his employment agreement with REMEC. 

        In
connection with the execution of the merger agreement, on May 19, 2002, Mr. Piazza, Spectrian's Vice President, Development, entered into an employment agreement with
REMEC pursuant to which Mr. Piazza will become the General Manager, Advanced Amplifier Products of REMEC upon the closing of the merger. REMEC will pay Mr. Piazza an annual base salary
of $195,000 and an annual target bonus of 20% of his annual base salary provided Mr. Piazza achieves certain objectives. REMEC will grant Mr. Piazza an option to purchase 30,000 shares
of REMEC's common stock at the then current fair market value immediately after he becomes an employee of REMEC. With respect to such option, 25% of the shares under this option will vest upon each
anniversary of the option's grant date over four years. 

        If
during the first three years of Mr. Piazza's employment with REMEC, he is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreement) or resigns for good reason (as defined in the
agreement), then Mr. Piazza will be entitled to receive: 


payment
of his base salary as in effect at the time of his termination, 100% of his targeted bonus and employee benefits for a period of one year after his
termination;


accelerated
vesting of all his options which were assumed by REMEC in connection with the merger; and


accelerated
vesting of all his options which were granted after the closing of the merger to the extent that such options would vest during the one year
severance period had he remained an employee of REMEC. 

        The
definition of good reason in Mr. Piazza's agreement is substantially similar to that set forth above for Mr. Waechter. In order to continue to receive his severance
payments and benefits during the one year severance period, Mr. Piazza will not engage in any activity which is deemed to be in competition with REMEC's advanced RF amplifier business.
Mr. Piazza also agreed not to solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee to leave his or her employment with REMEC during that one year period.
Mr. Piazza also released REMEC from any and all claims or any liability for severance benefits or stock acceleration except as set for in his employment agreement with REMEC. 

        In
connection with the execution of the merger agreement, on May 19, 2002, Mr. Jones, Spectrian's Vice President, Human Resources, entered into an employment agreement with
REMEC pursuant to which Mr. Jones will become the Vice President, Worldwide Human Resources of REMEC upon the closing of the merger. REMEC will pay Mr. Jones an annual base salary of
$175,000 and an annual target bonus of 20% of his annual base salary if Mr. Jones achieves certain objectives. REMEC will grant Mr. Jones an option to purchase 5,000 shares of REMEC's
common stock at the then 

current fair market value immediately after he becomes an employee of REMEC. With respect to such option, 25% of the shares under this option will vest upon each anniversary of the option's grant
date over four years. Mr. Jones will relocate to REMEC's headquarters in Del Mar, California and will also receive a relocation allowance of $85,000. If in the first three years of
Mr. Jones's employment with REMEC, he is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreement) or resigns for good reason (as defined in the agreement), then Mr. Jones will be entitled
to receive: 


payment
of his base salary as in effect at the time of his termination, 100% of his targeted bonus and employee benefits for a period of one year after his
termination;


accelerated
vesting of all his options which were assumed by REMEC in connection with the merger; and


accelerated
vesting of all his options which were granted after the closing of the merger to the extent that such options would vest in a one year severance
period if he had remained an employee of REMEC. Mr. Jones' relocation to REMEC's Del Mar, California offices will not be deemed good reason for his resignation. 

        The
definition of good reason in Mr. Jones' agreement is the same as set forth above for Mr. Waechter. In order to continue to receive his severance payments and benefits
during the one year severance period, Mr. Jones will not engage in any activity which is deemed to be in competition with REMEC's business. For 12 months after the termination of his employment
with REMEC for any reason, Mr. Jones has agreed not to solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee to leave his or her employment with REMEC. Mr. Jones released REMEC from any and all
claims or any liability for severance benefits or stock acceleration except as set for in his employment agreement with REMEC. 

 Continuing Directors  

        Two persons who are currently directors of Spectrian will serve as directors of REMEC after the merger. 

 Indemnification  

        Under the merger agreement, REMEC has agreed to honor Spectrian's obligations under the indemnification agreements between Spectrian and its directors and
officers in effect before the merger and any indemnification provisions in Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. REMEC has also agreed, for a period of six years
after the closing of the merger, to indemnify and hold harmless the officers and directors of Spectrian for any costs, expenses or losses related to any claim or suit arising out of any action taken
in such individual's capacity as an officer or director of Spectrian, provided that such action pertains to events which occurred prior to the closing of the merger. 

 Insurance  

        REMEC has agreed to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance covering the persons who are currently covered by Spectrian's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy for six years from the closing of the merger, provided that REMEC is not required to pay in any year more than 250% of the premium currently paid by Spectrian for such
insurance for the policy in effect prior to the closing of the merger. 

        Spectrian's
stockholders should consider whether these interests may have influenced the directors and officers of Spectrian to support or recommend the merger. 

Completion and effectiveness of the merger  

        The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger by
the Spectrian stockholders and approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the issuance of shares of REMEC common stock in the merger by the REMEC shareholders. The merger will become effective
upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

Structure of the merger and conversion of Spectrian common stock  

        REEF Acquisition Corp. is a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC referred to in this document as Merger Sub. To effect the merger, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Spectrian, with Spectrian being the surviving corporation. If, however, the parties are unable to obtain tax opinions that a merger of Merger Sub with and into Spectrian would
qualify as a "reorganization" but would be able to obtain these opinions if the transaction were restructured, then the transaction will be restructured so that Spectrian will be merged with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. In either event, the surviving corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC upon completion of the merger. 

        Upon
completion of the merger, shares of Spectrian common stock (other than shares held by Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive shares of
REMEC common stock, or, at REMEC's election, cash or a combination of cash and REMEC common stock, as described in "The Merger AgreementConsideration to be received in the merger"
beginning on page 77. No fractional shares of REMEC common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead of a fractional share, each Spectrian stockholder who receives REMEC common stock as
merger consideration will receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average REMEC share price
of a share of REMEC common stock. 

Exchange of Spectrian stock certificates  

        Each Spectrian stockholder was mailed an election form and transmittal letter with this joint proxy statement/prospectus for use in surrendering Spectrian stock
certificates in exchange for merger consideration. When a Spectrian stockholder delivers Spectrian stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed election form and transmittal letter
and any other required documents, the Spectrian stock certificates will be cancelled and the Spectrian stockholder will receive the merger consideration to which the stockholder is entitled under the
merger agreement. Spectrian stockholders will receive payment in cash in lieu of any fractional shares of REMEC common stock the stockholder may receive in exchange for Spectrian stock certificates. 

Treatment of Spectrian equity-based awards  

        As of the record date, Spectrian had outstanding options to purchase approximately 2,838,149 shares of Spectrian common stock under existing option
agreements and Spectrian's stock option plans other than the 1994 Director Option Plan. Upon the merger, REMEC will assume all options to purchase Spectrian common stock then outstanding under
Spectrian option agreements and Spectrian stock option plans other than the 1994 Director Option Plan. In addition, as of the effective time, each outstanding right to purchase Spectrian common stock
under its employee stock purchase plan will be assumed by REMEC in such a manner that it will be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under Spectrian's employee stock purchase plan as
amended and in effect immediately prior to the effective time. 

Material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger  

        The following summary discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to Spectrian stockholders. This discussion does not
address all of the United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their particular circumstances or to stockholders who are subject to
special rules, such as: 


dealers
in securities or foreign currencies;


stockholders
who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;


tax-exempt
organizations;


non-United
States persons or entities;


financial
institutions or insurance companies;


stockholders
whose shares are "qualified small business stock" under Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code;


stockholders
who exercise appraisal rights;


stockholders
who acquired Spectrian common stock in connection with stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or


stockholders
who hold Spectrian common stock as part of an integrated investment, straddle, hedge, or constructive sale, comprised of shares of Spectrian
common stock and one or more other positions. 

        In
addition, this discussion does not include the tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax law or the consequences of other transactions that may take place
before, after, or concurrently with the merger. This discussion assumes that Spectrian stockholders hold their shares of Spectrian common stock as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, as property held as an investment). 

        The
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger depend on whether it will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Although the completion of the merger is conditioned upon the delivery of an opinion by each of Heller Ehrman, counsel to REMEC, and Wilson Sonsini, counsel to Spectrian, that the merger will
qualify as a reorganization and that REMEC, Spectrian and Merger Sub are parties to that reorganization, these opinions are not binding upon the courts or the Internal Revenue Service and will not
prevent the Internal Revenue Service from successfully asserting a contrary position. Moreover, the opinions of counsel are based on assumptions, representations and covenants, including those in the
merger agreement and in representation letters from the managements of REMEC and Spectrian, and on the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, case law, and other authorities, all as presently in
effect. If the factual underpinnings of the opinions are in error, or if the legal underpinnings of the opinions change, including retroactively, the opinions could be invalidated. Neither REMEC nor
Spectrian will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax consequences of the merger to Spectrian stockholders. 

Accordingly, Spectrian stockholders are urged to consult their personal tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the
applicability and effect of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws to their particular circumstances.

        If
the merger were not treated as a reorganization, it would be a fully taxable transaction for all Spectrian stockholders, and each Spectrian stockholder would recognize aggregate
capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the REMEC 

common stock and any cash received pursuant to the merger and (ii) the Spectrian stockholder's tax basis in its shares of Spectrian common stock. In that event, the aggregate tax basis of the
REMEC common stock received by a Spectrian stockholder in connection with the merger would be equal to the fair market value of such REMEC common stock, and the holding period of that stock would
begin the day after the merger. 

        The
discussion that follows represents the opinion of Heller Ehrman and Wilson Sonsini as to the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger if the merger is
treated as a reorganization and REMEC, Spectrian and Merger Sub are parties to that reorganization, as provided in the opinions to be delivered by counsel at the closing of the merger. 

        Assuming
the merger qualifies as a reorganization, as provided in the tax opinions described above, then the following material United States federal income tax consequences will result
from such qualification: 


Spectrian
stockholders who receive solely REMEC common stock in exchange for Spectrian common stock in the merger will not recognize any gain or loss, except
for cash received instead of a fractional share of REMEC common stock as discussed below.


Spectrian
stockholders who receive both REMEC common stock and cash in exchange for Spectrian common stock in the merger will recognize gain (but not loss),
if any, with respect to the shares exchanged but only to the extent of the amount of cash received, other than cash received in lieu of a fractional share, which is discussed below. The amount of such
gain will equal the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash received in exchange for Spectrian common stock and the fair market value of the REMEC common stock received, and
(ii) the adjusted tax basis in the Spectrian common stock exchanged therefor. Any gain recognized will be treated as capital gain unless, as discussed below, the receipt of the cash has the
effect of the distribution of a dividend for United States federal income tax purposes, in which case the gain will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of the stockholder's ratable
share of Spectrian's accumulated earnings and profits. Any capital gain will be long-term capital gain if, as of the date of the merger, the holding period for the Spectrian shares in
respect of which the cash is received is more than one year. The determination of the amount of gain and whether any capital gain is long term, is made on a share-by-share
basis. That is, each Spectrian share, or block of shares acquired at the same price, will be treated as exchanged for a pro rata portion of cash and REMEC common stock.


Cash
payments received by a Spectrian stockholder for a fractional share of REMEC common stock will be treated as if such fractional share had been issued in
connection with the merger and then redeemed by REMEC, and a Spectrian stockholder will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to such cash payment, measured by the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash received and the tax basis in such fractional share. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss to a Spectrian stockholder if, as of the date of
the merger, the holding period for the fractional share redeemed (which will include the holding period of the Spectrian shares surrendered in the merger) is more than one year.


The
adjusted tax basis of the REMEC common stock received in the merger, including any fractional interest in REMEC common stock for which cash is received,
generally will be equal to the tax basis of the Spectrian shares surrendered therefor, decreased by the amount of cash received (other than cash received in payment for fractional share interests) and
increased by the amount of gain (other than from the redemption of fractional share interests) or dividend income recognized, if any.


The
holding period of the REMEC common stock received will include the holding period of the Spectrian common stock exchanged therefor. 


A
Spectrian stockholder who receives only cash in exchange for Spectrian common stock in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spectrian common stock surrendered, except to the extent the receipt of cash is treated as a
distribution of a dividend for United States federal income tax purposes. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the date of the merger, the holding
period for such shares is more than one year. 

        As
noted above, a Spectrian stockholder who exchanges Spectrian common stock for REMEC common stock and cash in the merger will be required to treat any gain recognized as ordinary
dividend income (rather than capital gain) if the effect of the exchange is essentially equivalent to the receipt of a dividend. This determination is made by treating a Spectrian stockholder who
receives cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share) in the merger as if the Spectrian stockholder had instead exchanged all of the stockholder's common stock for REMEC common stock, followed
immediately by a redemption of such hypothetical shares by REMEC for cash, which we call a Hypothetical Redemption. A Spectrian stockholder will recognize capital gain rather than dividend income with
respect to the cash received if the Hypothetical Redemption is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" or is "substantially disproportionate" with respect to such stockholder, taking into account
in each case the stockholder's actual and constructive ownership of REMEC common stock. 

        The
Hypothetical Redemption would be "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to a Spectrian stockholder if, based on all the facts and circumstances, it results in a
"meaningful reduction" in such stockholder's percentage ownership of REMEC common stock. The Internal Revenue Service has indicated in a published ruling that a stockholder in a
publicly-held corporation whose relative stock interest in the corporation is minimal and who exercises no control over corporate affairs is generally treated as having had a meaningful
reduction in his or her stock after a redemption transaction if his or her percentage stock ownership in the corporation has been reduced to any extent, taking into account the stockholder's actual
and constructive ownership before and after the Hypothetical Redemption. In that ruling, a reduction from .0001118% to .0001081% was held to be a meaningful reduction. 

        The
Hypothetical Redemption transaction would be "substantially disproportionate," and therefore would not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend with respect to a Spectrian
stockholder, if the percentage of REMEC common stock actually and constructively owned by such stockholder immediately after the Hypothetical Redemption is less than 80% of the percentage of REMEC
common stock actually, hypothetically and constructively owned by such stockholder immediately after both the actual and deemed receipt of the REMEC common stock but before the Hypothetical
Redemption. 

        Spectrian
stockholders should consult their tax advisors as to the possibility that all or a portion of any cash received in exchange for their Spectrian common stock will be treated as
a dividend and with respect to the consequences thereof, including the eligibility of Spectrian stockholders that are corporations for a dividends-received deduction and treatment of the dividend as
an "extraordinary dividend" under section 1059 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

 Tax reporting and tax withholding  

        Each stockholder will be required to retain records and file with the stockholder's United States federal income tax return a statement setting forth his or her
basis in the Spectrian shares surrendered and the fair market value of the REMEC common stock and cash received in the merger. Unless an exemption applies, the exchange agent will withhold 30% of any
cash payable to Spectrian stockholders who are subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding generally will apply only if a stockholder fails to furnish a correct social
security number or other taxpayer identification number and certify that the stockholder is not subject to backup withholding on the 

substitute Form W-9 that will be included in the transmittal letter that will be mailed to Spectrian stockholders by the exchange agent following the completion of the merger.
Foreign stockholders of Spectrian will generally be required to furnish a certification of foreign status on Form W-8 to minimize or eliminate withholding. 

        The
preceding is not meant to be a complete discussion or analysis of all potential tax effects relevant to the merger. Thus, Spectrian stockholders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws, and the effect of any proposed
changes in the tax laws. 

Accounting treatment of the merger  

        REMEC expects to account for the merger as a purchase for financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. For purposes of
preparing REMEC's consolidated financial statements, REMEC will establish a new accounting basis for Spectrian's assets and liabilities based upon their fair values as of the closing of the merger,
the merger consideration and the costs of the merger. Any excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of Spectrian will be recorded by REMEC as goodwill. A final determination of the
intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values, has not yet been made. REMEC will determine the fair value of Spectrian's assets and liabilities and will make appropriate purchase accounting adjustments, including adjustments to the
amortization period of the intangible assets, upon completion of that determination. 

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger  

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents certain transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the applicable waiting period expires or is
terminated. REMEC and Spectrian have filed with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, and the applicable waiting period began on June 5, 2002. The requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will be satisfied if the merger is completed within one year from the termination of the waiting period. On June 14, 2002, REMEC and Spectrian were advised that the
applicable governmental agencies had granted early termination of the waiting period. Even after the termination of the waiting period, the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice may
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. Other persons could also take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger, regardless of whether the waiting period has ended. 

        The
merger is also subject to notification to the Administrative Council for Economic Defense of Brazil under the Antitrust Law of June 11, 1994. REMEC and Spectrian made the
requisite filing with the Brazilian authorities on June 7, 2002. Brazilian authorities may take four to six months to review the filing. The approval of the Brazil authorities is not required
prior to completing the merger. However, REMEC and Spectrian cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such challenge is made, of the result.
Neither REMEC nor Spectrian believes that completion of the merger will result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. 

        REMEC
and Spectrian do not believe that any additional material governmental filings in the United States or other foreign jurisdictions, other than the certificate of merger in
Delaware, are required with respect to the merger. 

Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates of REMEC or Spectrian  

        The issuance of REMEC common stock in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act. These shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act,
except for shares of REMEC common stock issued to any person who is an affiliate of Spectrian (or becomes an affiliate of REMEC following the merger). Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of
Spectrian include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Spectrian and may include some of the officers and directors of Spectrian, as well as the
principal stockholders of Spectrian. For a period of one year following the merger, affiliates of Spectrian may not sell their shares of REMEC common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to
(1) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, (2) in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (3) any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. After the one-year anniversary of the merger, REMEC shares held by affiliates of Spectrian (who are not affiliates of REMEC) will be
freely tradable. Shares held by affiliates of REMEC will continue be subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 

Listing of REMEC common stock to be issued in the merger  

        It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the shares of REMEC common stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National
Market, subject to official notice of issuance. 

Delisting and deregistration of Spectrian common stock after the merger  

        If the merger is completed, Spectrian common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. Consequently,
following completion of the merger, Spectrian stockholders will no longer be able to trade shares of Spectrian common stock on any stock exchange. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This description is not complete, and you are urged to read the full text of the merger agreement. In addition, important information about the merger agreement and the merger is
provided in the previous section titled "The Merger" beginning on page 43.

Effective time and effect of merger  

        The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is
agreed to in writing by REMEC, Spectrian and Merger Sub. That time is the "effective time" of the merger. The closing of the merger will occur no later than the third business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger unless the parties agree otherwise. The date upon which the closing occurs is the "closing date" of the merger. The certificate of merger will be
filed on the closing date. The closing and the effective time are anticipated to occur in the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2002. 

        At
the effective time, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a corporation and will be merged with and into Spectrian, with Spectrian being the surviving corporation. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, however, REMEC and Spectrian have the right to change the structure of the merger such that, at the effective time, Spectrian will cease to exist as a corporation and will be merged
with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. Either party may make the election to restructure the merger if that party's counsel determines that either: 


the
merger as initially structured would not qualify as a reorganization under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; or


each
of REMEC, Spectrian and Merger Sub would not be a party to such reorganization under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 

        In
either case, the corporation surviving the merger is sometimes referred to as the surviving corporation, and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC. 

Merger consideration  

 Consideration to be received in the merger  

        The merger consideration, whether in REMEC common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock, that a Spectrian stockholder will receive in the merger will
depend on REMEC's election to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash and the choices made by other Spectrian stockholders as described in "Stockholder elections" below. 

        Pursuant
to the terms of the merger agreement, REMEC may decide to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, and it must make its decision no later than five business days prior
to the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. Spectrian and REMEC expect that the closing date will be the day of or the next business day after the Spectrian stockholders and REMEC shareholders
vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. It is expected that the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders will be held on [            ],
2002. However, the merger is subject to governmental and regulatory approvals and other conditions, some of which are beyond REMEC's and Spectrian's control, and, therefore, REMEC and Spectrian cannot
predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger. If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, it will publicly announce its decision by: 


issuing
a press release;


posting
the election on its web site; and 


providing
the information at the following toll-free number: 1-800-[]. 

Spectrian stockholders are encouraged to contact REMEC's website or the toll-free number to determine whether REMEC has elected to pay a portion of
the merger consideration in cash.

Spectrian stockholders should return their stock certificates with the enclosed election form and transmittal letter.  

REMEC shareholders should not return REMEC stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

 Stock only merger consideration  

        If REMEC does not elect to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, or fails to make a timely choice, then, at the effective time of the merger, each
Spectrian stockholder will have the right to receive that number of shares of REMEC common stock equal to the exchange ratio for each share of Spectrian common stock held by the stockholder. 

        The
exchange ratio depends on the average trading price of REMEC common stock for a ten-day period ending on and including the second trading day before the Spectrian special meeting of
stockholders, which is referred to in this document as the average REMEC share price: 


if
the average REMEC share price is greater than $10.50, then the exchange ratio will be 1.33333;


if
the average REMEC share price is less than $7.00, then the exchange ratio will be 2.0; and


if
the average REMEC share price is equal to or greater than $7.00 but equal to or lower than $10.50, then the exchange ratio will be the number equal to
14.00 divided by the average REMEC share price. 

        A
Spectrian stockholder will not receive any fraction of a share of REMEC common stock in the merger. All fractions of a share of REMEC common stock that a given Spectrian stockholder is
entitled to receive will be aggregated. Any fractional share of REMEC common stock remaining after the aggregation will be paid in cash equal to the fraction multiplied by the average REMEC share
price. 

To the extent that REMEC does not elect to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, or fails to make a timely election, any election forms received by
the exchange agent will be void and of no force and effect. Spectrian stockholders will not have a right to receive cash consideration, other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, unless REMEC
elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash.

 Combination of stock and cash merger consideration  

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, REMEC may elect to pay up to $4.00 of the per share merger consideration in cash. If REMEC chooses to pay a portion
of the merger consideration in cash, then each Spectrian stockholder will have the right to receive, at the effective time of the merger, based on the election of that Spectrian stockholder as
indicated below and subject to the allocation and proration provisions described below, the following merger consideration: 


Cash Election.
  A Spectrian stockholder may elect to receive for each share of Spectrian common
stock an amount of cash of $14.00 per share.


Stock Election.
  A Spectrian stockholder may elect to receive for each share of Spectrian common
stock a number of shares of REMEC common stock equal to the exchange ratio.


Combination Election.
  A Spectrian stockholder may elect to receive a combination of cash at
$14.00 per share of Spectrian common stock for a specified number of shares of Spectrian 

common
stock and the number of shares of REMEC common stock as determined by the exchange ratio for the remaining shares of Spectrian common stock. 

        If
a Spectrian stockholder fails to make an election or fails to submit a valid election form prior to the election deadline described below for any of shares of Spectrian common stock,
then those shares will be considered undesignated shares and will receive the merger consideration described below in "Undesignated shares." 

        A
Spectrian stockholder will not receive any fraction of a share of REMEC common stock in the merger. All fractions of a share of REMEC common stock that a Spectrian stockholder is
otherwise entitled to receive will be aggregated. Any fractional share of REMEC common stock remaining after the aggregation will be paid in cash equal to the fraction multiplied by the average REMEC
share price. 

Because of the election, allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, there is no assurance that a Spectrian stockholder will receive the
proportion of REMEC common stock and cash indicated on such stockholder's election form.

Stockholder elections  

        If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, Spectrian stockholders have the opportunity to make an election to receive cash, REMEC
common stock or a combination of cash and REMEC common stock, according to the allocation and proration procedures set forth in the election form provided for this purpose. REMEC has selected Mellon
Investor Services, which is REMEC's transfer agent, to serve as the exchange agent for the purpose of carrying out the allocation and proration procedures described below. 

 Election form  

        An election form and transmittal letter is included with the joint proxy statement/prospectus sent to Spectrian stockholders. If REMEC elects to pay a portion of
the merger consideration in cash, the election form is for use by Spectrian stockholders to make elections to receive as merger consideration cash, REMEC common stock or a combination of cash and
REMEC common stock. To make an election, a Spectrian stockholder must submit a properly completed and signed election form by the election deadline,
[                        ], 2002.
Because REMEC may elect to pay some of the merger consideration in cash as late as five business days before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, Spectrian stockholders are encouraged to
submit an election form promptly. 

        If
a Spectrian stockholder delivers an election form to the exchange agent after the election deadline, or the election form does not comply with the required procedures, the stockholder
will not be regarded as having made an election. See "Undesignated shares" below. Spectrian stockholders should read the election form for a discussion of the election procedures. 

 Election deadline  

        The deadline for Spectrian stockholders to make elections is the close of business on the last business day before the anticipated closing of the merger,
[                        ], 2002. REMEC and Spectrian expect the closing date to be the day of or the next business day after the
Spectrian special meeting of stockholders and the REMEC
special meeting of shareholders, assuming that Spectrian stockholders and REMEC shareholders approve the matters considered at their respective meetings. Accordingly, Spectrian
stockholders who wish to make an election should make sure that their election form is received by the exchange agent no later than 5 p.m. Eastern Time on
[            ], 2002. 

        If
REMEC has elected to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash and the merger is not closed on or before
[                        ], 2002, REMEC and Spectrian
will issue a press release on the Dow 

Jones News Service at least five business days before completing the merger. The press release will inform Spectrian stockholders of the last date for submitting or changing their election forms. 

Proration and allocation of merger consideration  

        If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, and subject to the proration and allocation procedures described below, Spectrian
stockholders having a preference as to the form of consideration they wish to receive for their shares of Spectrian common stock should make an election by filling out the election form included with
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. None of REMEC, the REMEC board of directors, Spectrian or the Spectrian board of directors makes any recommendation as to whether Spectrian stockholders should
make an election or what election they should make. Each Spectrian stockholder must make an individual decision as to whether to make an election and, if so, what election to make. Because REMEC may
elect to pay some of the merger consideration in cash as late as five business days before the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders, Spectrian stockholders are encouraged to submit an election
form promptly. 

Allocation  

        In the event REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, the allocation of the merger consideration among the Spectrian stockholders
depends upon the elections made by the stockholders. The election forms may be submitted until the close of business on the last business day prior to the closing date, and it may take a period of
time (not to exceed five business days after the effective time of the merger) before the exchange agent can verify the election forms and tabulate the election results. Therefore, there will be a
period of time following the completion of the merger before the individual allocation of the merger consideration can be determined. Consequently, the payment of the merger consideration to Spectrian
stockholders will begin some time after the merger is completed. 

        The
elections made by Spectrian stockholders will be subject to limits on the total amount of cash and the total number of shares of REMEC common stock to be issued as merger
consideration. 

        Assuming
REMEC chooses to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash: 


the
maximum cash amount that REMEC will pay to all Spectrian stockholders will equal the per share cash amount that REMEC has chosen to pay multiplied by the
outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, which is referred to in this document as the Maximum Cash Consideration; and


the
maximum number of shares of REMEC common stock that REMEC will issue to all Spectrian stockholders will equal the difference between the per share cash
amount and $14.00 divided by 14.00, and then multiplied by the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and further multiplied by the exchange
ratio, which is referred to in this documents as the Maximum Stock Consideration. 

For
example, if REMEC chooses to pay $4.00 per share of the merger consideration in cash then, assuming that there are 11,470,897 shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time, the Maximum Cash Consideration would be $45,883,588. Further, assuming an exchange ratio of 1.65, then the Maximum Stock Consideration will equal 13,518,906, or (($14.00 
$4.00) divided by 14.00) * 11,470,588 * 1.65. 

        In
order to determine the merger consideration, the exchange agent will determine limits on the number of Spectrian shares that can be converted into cash and on the number of Spectrian
shares that can be converted into shares of REMEC common stock as follows: 


the
maximum number of shares of Spectrian common stock that can be converted into the right to receive cash of $14.00 per share will equal the product of the
per share cash amount which REMEC elects to pay divided by $14.00 multiplied by the number of shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding, which is referred to as the Cash Election Limit; and


the
maximum number of shares of Spectrian common stock that can be converted into the right to receive shares of REMEC common stock will equal the difference
between the per share cash amount and $14.00 divided by 14.00 and multiplied by the number of shares of Spectrian common stock outstanding, which is referred to as the Stock Election Limit. 

        While
the Maximum Stock Consideration and Maximum Cash Consideration to be provided in connection with the merger will be known at the closing, the exact amount of cash and the exact
number of shares of REMEC common stock that will be issued to any particular Spectrian stockholder
cannot be determined until the merger is completed and the stockholder election forms are reviewed and tabulated by the exchange agent. However, as promptly as possible and in no event later than five
business days after the effective time, REMEC will cause the exchange agent to review all of the election forms and tabulate the exact amount of cash and exact numbers of shares of REMEC common stock
that each holder of Spectrian common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. 

Because of the proration provisions of the merger agreement, a Spectrian stockholder may not receive the proportion of REMEC common stock and cash indicated on
such Spectrian stockholder's election form.

Proration rules  

        The amount of cash and the number of shares of REMEC common stock that will be received by Spectrian stockholders will be subject to proration if the indicated
interest on the election forms received exceeds the Stock Election Limit or exceeds the Cash Election Limit. 

        Elections exceed the Stock Election Limit.
    If holders of Spectrian common stock elect in the
aggregate to convert their shares of Spectrian common stock into a total number of shares of REMEC common stock that exceeds the Stock Election Limit, then 


all
elections to receive cash will be accepted;


all
undesignated shares will be deemed to have made cash elections; and


to
the extent necessary so that the number of shares of Spectrian common stock to be converted into REMEC common stock does not exceed the Stock Election
Limit, the exchange agent will prorate the remaining shares of REMEC common stock among all Spectrian stockholders who made a stock election or a combination stock election and will treat such persons
as having made a cash election as to the remainder of such persons' Spectrian common stock. Proration with respect to each holder will be determined by multiplying (i) the fraction equal to
such holder's stock election shares divided by the total number of stock election shares by (ii) the proration factor. The proration factor will be determined by dividing the Stock Election
Limit by the total number of stock election shares submitted. 

        Elections exceed the Cash Election Limit.
    If holders of Spectrian common stock elect in the aggregate
to convert their shares of Spectrian common stock into cash that exceeds the Cash Election Limit, then 


all
stock elections will be accepted; 


all
undesignated shares will be deemed to have made stock elections;


to
the extent necessary so that the number of shares of Spectrian common stock to be converted into cash does not exceed the Cash Election Limit, the
exchange agent will prorate the remaining cash among all Spectrian stockholders who made a cash election or a combination election and will treat such persons as having made a stock election as to the
remainder of such persons' Spectrian common stock. Proration with respect to each holder will be determining by multiplying (i) the fraction equal to such holder's cash election shares divided
by the total number of cash election shares by (ii) the proration factor. The proration factor will be determined by dividing the Cash Election Limit by the total number of cash election shares
submitted. 

Because of the allocation and proration provisions described above, a Spectrian stockholder may not receive the proportion of REMEC common stock and cash
indicated on such holder's election form.

Changes and revocation of elections  

        Any Spectrian stockholder may change that stockholder's election prior to the election deadline by submitting to the exchange agent a new, properly completed and
signed revised election form. 

        Any
Spectrian stockholder may revoke that stockholder's election form at any time prior to the election deadline by written notice to the exchange agent. In the event an election form is
revoked prior to the election deadline, the shares of Spectrian common stock represented by such election form will automatically become undesignated shares unless and until a new election is properly
made. Once the election deadline passes, all elections will become irrevocable. 

Undesignated shares  

        The shares of Spectrian common stock held by Spectrian stockholders who do not submit an election form prior to the election deadline, or who revoke their
election form and do not properly submit a new election form, will be treated as undesignated shares. If REMEC or the exchange agent determines that any election was not properly made, such election
will have no force and effect, and
the shares with respect to which such election was made will be deemed to be undesignated shares. Neither REMEC nor the exchange agent has any obligation to inform any Spectrian stockholder of any
defect in the making of an election. REMEC and the exchange agent reserve the right to waive, in their sole discretion, defects in an election form, including late delivery. 

        Holders
of undesignated shares will be entitled to receive a mix of cash and stock in amounts so as to allow REMEC to pay aggregate merger consideration as close as possible to the Stock
Election Limit and the Cash Election Limit. 

Exchange of Spectrian stock certificates  

        Each holder of record of Spectrian common stock was mailed an election form and transmittal letter with this joint proxy statement/prospectus containing
instructions on surrendering their certificates of Spectrian common stock in exchange for the merger consideration they are entitled to receive. 

        Holders
of certificates previously representing Spectrian common stock will not be paid dividends or distributions on any REMEC common shares or cash they are entitled to receive as
merger consideration, and will not be paid cash in lieu of a fractional REMEC common share, until their Spectrian stock certificates are surrendered for exchange. When the certificates are
surrendered, any unpaid dividends declared by REMEC after the consummation of the merger and any cash in lieu of a fractional REMEC common share will be paid without interest. 

        The
exchange agent will deliver the merger consideration in exchange for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates if the owner of such certificates signs an affidavit of loss, theft or
destruction, as appropriate. The exchange agent may also, in its discretion, require the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as indemnity
against any claim that might be made against REMEC or the exchange agent with respect to alleged lost, stolen or destroyed certificates. 

Treatment of Spectrian equity-based awards  

        As of June 14, 2002, Spectrian had outstanding options to purchase approximately 2,813,052 shares of Spectrian common stock under existing option
agreements and Spectrian's stock option plans other than options issued pursuant to the 1994 Director Option Plan. Upon the merger, REMEC will assume all options to purchase Spectrian common stock
then outstanding under Spectrian option agreements and Spectrian stock option plans other than options outstanding under the 1994 Director Option Plan. 

        Each
Spectrian option that is outstanding and unexercised upon the consummation of the merger (other than options outstanding under Spectrian's 1994 Director Option Plan) will be
converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of REMEC common stock equal to the exchange ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Spectrian stock covered by the option immediately
before the merger (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The exercise price per share of REMEC common stock subject to each option will equal its pre-conversion price per share of
Spectrian common stock subject to such option divided by the exchange ratio (rounded to five decimal places). In the event the aggregate exercise price results in the payment of a fraction of a cent
at the time of exercise, the aggregate exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exchange ratio is described above under the caption "The Merger AgreementStock only
merger consideration." Within five business days after the closing of the merger, REMEC will file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to
register the REMEC common stock issuable upon exercise of the Spectrian options it assumes in the merger. 

        In
addition, Spectrian amended its employee stock purchase plan to provide that as of the effective time of the merger no additional purchase rights will be issued and all outstanding
purchase rights will terminate on the date such holder enrolls in REMEC's employee stock purchase plan. Each assumed purchase right to purchase Spectrian common stock under its employee stock purchase
plan will be assumed by REMEC in such a manner that it will be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under Spectrian's employee stock purchase plan as amended and in effect immediately
prior to the effective time. Each purchase right will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of REMEC common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the exchange ratio
multiplied by the number of shares of Spectrian common stock for which such purchase right would have otherwise been exercisable determined as of the relevant grant date under the Spectrian employee
stock purchase plan. The purchase price per share will be equal to 85% of the lower of (i) the fair market value of a share of Spectrian common stock on the relevant grant date divided by the
exchange ratio or (ii) the fair market value of a share of REMEC common stock on the relevant purchase date.

take,
or agree to take, any of the actions described above. 

Conduct of business following the merger  

        Depending on the final determination of the structure of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement, either (a) Merger Sub will cease to exist as a
corporation and will be merged with and into Spectrian, with Spectrian being the surviving corporation, or (b) Spectrian will cease to exist as a corporation and will be merged with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. Regardless of whether Spectrian or Merger Sub is the surviving corporation of the merger, all property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Spectrian and Merger Sub will vest in the surviving corporation and the all debts, liabilities and duties of Spectrian and Merger Sub will becomes the debts, liabilities and duties of
the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of REMEC. 

        The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
corporation. At the effective time, the certificate of incorporation will be amended so that the name of the surviving corporation is Spectrian Corporation. The directors and officers of Merger Sub at
the effective time will become the initial directors and officers of the surviving corporation. 

        Following
the merger, the board of directors of REMEC will consist of eight persons, six of whom were directors of REMEC immediately prior to the merger, and two of whom were directors
of Spectrian prior to the merger. 

        In
addition, after the merger is completed, Thomas H. Waechter, Spectrian's President and Chief Executive Officer, will become the President and Chief Operating Officer of REMEC. 

No solicitation  

        Until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the effective time of the merger, Spectrian has agreed that it will not, and its subsidiaries will
not, and that it will use reasonable efforts to cause its or any of its subsidiaries' officers, directors, affiliates, employees, attorneys, investment bankers or other advisors or representatives not
to: 


solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);


participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other
action for the purpose of, facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal;


engage
in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;


approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or


enter
into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction (as
defined below). 

        An "Acquisition Proposal" is any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" is
any transaction or series of transactions involving: 


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries is a constituent corporation unless the stockholders of Spectrian as a group, as determined immediately prior to such
transaction or series of transactions, own greater than 85% of the outstanding securities of the surviving entity (or ultimate parent entity of such surviving entity) of such transaction or series of
transactions, provided that such transaction or series of transactions does not result in any person becoming an "acquiring person" as defined in Spectrian's stockholder rights plan agreement and does
not result in any such pre-existing stockholder and its affiliates increasing its beneficial ownership of Spectrian securities by more than 5%;


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which a person or "group" of persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries, unless the stockholders of Spectrian as a group, as determined immediately prior to such transaction or series of
transactions, own greater than 85% of the outstanding securities of any class of securities of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries after such transaction or series of transactions, provided that such
transaction or series of transactions does not result in any person becoming an "acquiring person" as defined in Spectrian's stockholder rights plan agreement and does not result in any such
pre-existing stockholder and its affiliates increasing its beneficial ownership of Spectrian securities by more than 5%;


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries issues securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of
Spectrian of any of its subsidiaries;


any
direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses of or assets or rights that
constitute or account for 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries; or


any
liquidation or dissolution of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries that constitutes or accounts for 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or assets of Spectrian. 

        However,
Spectrian and its board of directors may participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information to, any third party that has made an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that the Spectrian board of directors determines in good faith (a) after consultation with its financial advisor that the potential acquirer has the financial wherewithal to be
reasonably capable of consummating such Acquisition Proposal, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer (as defined below) and (b) after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such information would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors under applicable law. Any
non-public information provided to a potential acquirer in accordance with the merger agreement will be furnished pursuant to a confidential, standstill and no solicitation agreement
containing provisions at least as favorable to Spectrian as its agreement with REMEC. 

        A
"Superior Offer" is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of
capital stock (including 

without limitation by way of a tender or exchange offer) or similar transaction with respect to Spectrian on terms that the board of directors of Spectrian determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, that if accepted is reasonably likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, be more favorable to Spectrian's stockholders than the merger, provided that
any such offer will not be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required to complete the transaction is not committed. 

        Spectrian
has agreed to notify REMEC in writing promptly, and in any event within one day, of its determination to furnish information to a potential or of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, and the notice will include the identity of the recipient of the information to be provided and/or the potential acquirer and the terms of such Acquisition Proposal. Spectrian has also
agreed to notify REMEC of any meeting of the board of directors of Spectrian at which the board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Proposal at least three
business days prior to such meeting, or such lesser time as provided to the members of the board but in no event less than 24 hours prior to such meeting. 

        Spectrian
has also agreed not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which Spectrian is a party, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any such agreements at REMEC's request. Spectrian will also promptly request each person other than REMEC that has executed a confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement since May 19, 2001 in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal to return all confidential information furnished to such person by or on behalf of Spectrian. 

        Spectrian's
board of directors may not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger unless all of the conditions below are met: 


a
Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn;


Spectrian
provides written notice to REMEC of receipt of the Superior Offer in the manner described above;


REMEC
has not, within three business days of its receipt of notice of the Superior Offer, made an offer that the board of directors of Spectrian concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, to be at least as favorable to Spectrian's stockholders as the Superior Offer;


the
board of directors of Spectrian concludes, after consultation with legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to Spectrian's stockholders under applicable law; and


Spectrian
has not violated its agreement not to solicit Acquisition Proposals. 

        Unless
the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement must be submitted to Spectrian's stockholders for approval and adoption regardless of
whether the Spectrian board of directors has withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified its recommendation in favor of the merger as set forth above. If Spectrian does withdraw or modify its
recommendation in a manner adverse to REMEC, Spectrian has agreed, at the request of REMEC, to waive any standstill or similar provisions applicable to REMEC, and to render such other reasonable
administrative assistance to REMEC in the solicitation of proxies in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. 

Certain other covenants  

 Indemnification and insurance  

        For six years following the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries and 

each person who serves or has served at the request of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at any time prior to the effective time (the "indemnified parties") against any costs or expenses, including attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, whether arising before or after the effective time, to the extent they arise out of or pertain to any action or omission in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Spectrian
occurring at or prior to the effective time. 

        Following
the merger, the surviving corporation will continue to honor in all respects Spectrian's obligations under the indemnification agreements or agreements for advancement of fees
and expenses with indemnified parties, and any provisions for indemnification, advancement of fees and expenses and exculpation under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended
and restated bylaws of Spectrian as in effect on May 19, 2002. 

        REMEC
will provide, or cause the surviving corporation to provide, for a period of six years after the effective time, Spectrian's current directors and officers with an insurance and
indemnification policy for events occurring at or prior to the effective time that is no less favorable than Spectrian's existing policy. REMEC and the surviving corporation will not, however, be
required to pay an annual insurance premium in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by Spectrian for such insurance, but in such case will purchase the greatest coverage available for
such amount. 

 Employee matters  

        REMEC will cause employees of Spectrian who continue as employees of REMEC following the effective time to be eligible to participate in REMEC's stock option
plans and employee stock purchase plan, and its health and welfare benefit plans, programs and practices generally applicable to other similarly-situated employees of REMEC. REMEC will recognize, from
and after the effective time, each continuing employee's service with Spectrian for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in and vesting, and if applicable, eligibility to commence
participation in retirement plans, under such REMEC plans. Compensation provided to continuing employees following the effective time will be determined in the sole discretion of REMEC. REMEC will
waive any pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations under its applicable health plans, except to extent an insurance company withholds any required permission, and any deductibles
or co-payments applicable to such plans will be reduced by any amounts paid by continuing employees (or to their dependents) to any such plan for the plan year in which the effective time
occurs. At REMEC's request, Spectrian will take all necessary action to terminate Spectrian's 401(k) plan effective prior to the effective time. 

 Rights Agreements  

        Except as expressly required by the merger agreement, Spectrian agreed not to amend its shareholder rights agreement or take any other action with respect to, or
make any determination under, such rights agreement (including a redemption of rights) without the prior written consent of REMEC. 

        If
REMEC determines that the completion of the merger would result in a Spectrian stockholder becoming an "acquiring person" as that term is defined in REMEC's shareholder rights
agreement as a result of shares of REMEC common stock received by the Spectrian stockholder in the merger, REMEC will take all necessary action to amend its rights plan to provide that such
stockholder will not be deemed to be an acquiring person. 

Conditions to the completion of the merger

by
mutual written consent duly authorized by the board of directors of both REMEC and Spectrian;


by
either REMEC or Spectrian


if
the merger has not been consummated by November 15, 2002, provided that this right to terminate is not available to a party whose action or failure
to act has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before November 15, 2002 and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the
merger agreement;

or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger;


if
a meeting of Spectrian's stockholders is not held or if Spectrian's stockholders do not approve the merger at a meeting of Spectrian's stockholders,

failure to act and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement;


if
a meeting of REMEC's shareholders is not held or if REMEC's shareholders do not approve the merger at a meeting of REMEC's shareholders, provided that

warranty is not cured within twenty business days following written notice from the terminating party of such inaccuracy; or


upon

obligation to complete the merger described above under "Conditions to the completion of the merger" would not be satisfied, provided that such breach is not cured within twenty business days
following written notice from the terminating party of such breach. 


by
REMEC if a Spectrian Triggering Event has occurred. 

        A
"Spectrian Triggering Event" will occur if: 


the
board of directors of Spectrian fails to recommend or otherwise withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to REMEC its recommendation that Spectrian
stockholders vote to adopt and approve the merger and the merger agreement;


Spectrian
fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement;

board of directors of Spectrian approves or recommends to its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction;


Spectrian
enters into any letter of intent or similar document or contract accepting any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction;

tender or exchange offer relating to Spectrian's securities is commenced and Spectrian either recommends the tender or exchange offer or fails to send to
its stockholders within five business days after the tender or exchange offer is commenced a statement disclosing that Spectrian recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;


an
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced and Spectrian fails to issue a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal within five
business days after the Acquisition Proposal is announced or otherwise fails to actively oppose the Acquisition Proposal; or


Spectrian
breaches certain covenants in the merger agreement relating to its obligations not to solicit Acquisition Proposals, to hold a stockholder meeting,
to solicit proxies in favor of the merger and to assist in the preparation of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Fees, expenses and termination fee  

        In general, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the
party that incurs them. REMEC and Spectrian will share equally the filing fees paid in connection with the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which this
joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and the costs of printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and will share equally all fees, other than attorneys' and accountants' fees, incurred in connection
with the filings 

made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and with the Brazilian antitrust authorities. 

        If
REMEC terminates the merger agreement because a "Spectrian Triggering Event" has occurred, then Spectrian must pay REMEC $6,000,000 within two days of the termination. 

        Spectrian
has also agreed to pay REMEC a termination fee of $6,000,000 if, prior to the termination of the merger agreement because of (a) or (b) below, a third party publicly announces
and has not withdrawn an Acquisition Proposal and, within 12 months following the termination of the merger agreement, Spectrian consummates any Acquisition Transaction or enters into an
agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction that is later consummated: 

(a)
the
merger has not been consummated by November 15, 2002, for any reason other than REMEC's or Spectrian's action, or failure to act, which has been the principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the merger to occur before November 15, 2002, and which constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement; or

(b)
the
required approval of Spectrian's stockholders has not been obtained by reason of the failure to hold a meeting or the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly convened
meeting of Spectrian's stockholders. 

        An
"Acquisition Transaction" for purposes of determining whether a termination fee must be paid is any of the following transactions (or series of the following transactions): 


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries is a constituent corporation unless the stockholders of Spectrian as a group and determined immediately prior to such
transaction or series of transactions own greater than 85% of the outstanding securities of the surviving entity of such transaction or series of transactions;


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which a person or "group" of persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 50% of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of Spectrian
or any of its subsidiaries, unless the stockholders of Spectrian as a group and determined immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions own greater than 85% of the outstanding
securities of such class of securities of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries after such transaction or series of transactions;


a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange
offer or other similar transaction in which Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries issues securities representing more than 50% of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of
Spectrian of any of its subsidiaries;


any
direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses of or assets or rights that
constitute or account for 50% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries; or


any
liquidation or dissolution of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries that constitutes or accounts for 50% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or assets of Spectrian. 

Amendment and waiver; parties in interest  

        REMEC, Merger Sub and Spectrian may together amend the merger agreement in writing by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to completion of 

the merger. However, after approval of the merger by the stockholders of Spectrian, the merger agreement cannot be amended without the necessary stockholder approval as required by law. 

        At
any time prior to the completion of the merger, any of REMEC, Merger Sub or Spectrian may waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement.
Any waiver will be valid if set forth in writing by the party or parties granting the waiver. 

        The
merger agreement is binding on upon and inures solely to the benefit of the parties thereto, and nothing in the merger agreement confers upon any other person any right, benefit,
remedy or obligation, other than the indemnification and insurance obligations of REMEC and the surviving corporation following the completion of the merger, which are intended for the benefit of
certain specified officers and directors of Spectrian and may be enforced by such individuals. 

Other agreements  

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the REMEC voting agreements, Spectrian voting agreements and affiliate agreements. Copies of the form of
REMEC voting agreement, form of Spectrian voting agreement and form of affiliate agreement are included as Annexes F, G, and H, respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The following is
not a complete description of all of the provisions of these agreements, and you are urged to read in their entirety the form of REMEC voting agreement, form of Spectrian voting agreement and form of
affiliate agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of these agreements. 

 Voting agreements  

        REMEC voting agreements.
    In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, certain of REMEC's directors
entered into voting agreements, the REMEC voting agreements, with Spectrian. These REMEC voting agreements require the REMEC directors to vote all outstanding shares of REMEC common stock (including
common stock issued pursuant to all options and other rights to acquire REMEC common stock) they beneficially own or may acquire: 


in
favor of the approval of the merger and the merger agreement, and any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the merger;


in
favor of the issuance of shares of REMEC common stock in the merger;


against
any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement of REMEC under the
merger agreement;


against
any action or agreement that would cause any provision contained in section 8 of the merger agreement to not be satisfied; and


against
(i) any change in a majority of the members of the REMEC board of directors, and/or (ii) any other action which is intended, or could
reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
or the REMEC voting agreement. 

        In
addition, each REMEC director who entered into the REMEC voting agreements with Spectrian agreed not cause or permit any transfer of any of their shares of REMEC common stock, tender
any of their shares of REMEC common stock to any person, or create or permit any encumbrance on their shares of REMEC common stock which affects, directly or indirectly, the right to vote the shares
as provided in the REMEC voting agreement. 

        As
of June 14, 2002, the directors who entered into the REMEC voting agreements with Spectrian collectively held approximately 2,127,625 shares of REMEC common stock (including
476,382 shares of REMEC common stock subject to unvested options covered by the REMEC voting agreements), which then represented approximately 4.72% of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock.
None of the REMEC directors and executive officers that entered into a REMEC voting agreement received 

any consideration in connection with entering into the agreement. The REMEC voting agreements terminate on the earlier to occur of the date of the termination of the merger agreement and the
effective date of the merger. The form of REMEC voting agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. 

        Spectrian voting agreements.
    In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, certain of Spectrian's directors and
executive officers entered into voting agreements, the Spectrian voting agreements, with REMEC. These Spectrian voting agreements require the Spectrian directors and executive officers to vote all
outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock (including common stock issued pursuant to all options and other rights to acquire Spectrian common stock) they beneficially own or may acquire: 


in
favor of the approval of the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement, and any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the merger;


against
any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement of Spectrian under
the merger agreement;


against
any action or agreement that would cause any provision contained in section 8 of the merger agreement to not be satisfied; and


against
(i) any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), (ii) change in a majority of the members of the Spectrian board of
directors, or (iii) any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the
merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the Spectrian voting agreement. 

        In
addition, each Spectrian director and executive officer who entered into the Spectrian voting agreements with REMEC agreed not cause or permit any transfer of any of their shares of
Spectrian common stock, tender any of their shares of Spectrian common stock to any person, or create or permit any encumbrance on their shares of Spectrian common stock which affects, directly or
indirectly, the right to vote the shares as provided in the Spectrian voting agreement. 

        As
of June 14, 2002, the directors and executive officers who entered into the Spectrian voting agreements with REMEC collectively held approximately 1,513,137 shares of
Spectrian common stock (including 684,668 shares of Spectrian common stock subject to unvested options covered by the Spectrian voting agreements), which then represented approximately 11.7% of
the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock. None of the Spectrian directors and executive officers that entered into a Spectrian voting agreement received any consideration in connection with
entering into the agreement. The Spectrian voting agreements terminate on the earlier to occur of the date of the termination of the merger agreement and the effective date of the merger. The form of
Spectrian voting agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G. 

 Affiliate agreements  

        Prior to the closing of the merger, REMEC will enter into affiliate agreements with those Spectrian directors, officers, stockholders or employees who are
affiliates of Spectrian within the meaning of the Securities Act. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, each Spectrian affiliate will agree not to dispose of his, her or its shares of REMEC common
stock received in the merger unless the disposition is permitted under the rules and regulations of the federal securities laws. The form of affiliate agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex H. 

RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL    

Spectrian stockholders  

        Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Spectrian stockholders may object to the merger and demand in writing that Spectrian pay the fair value of their
shares only if REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash. Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must comply with all of the procedures to preserve those rights. A
copy of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth the appraisal rights, is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Section 262
sets forth the procedures a stockholder requesting appraisal must follow. These procedures are complicated and must be followed completely. Failure to comply with the
procedures may cause your appraisal rights to terminate. The following information is only a summary of the required procedures and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of
Section 262. Please review Section 262 for the complete procedures. 

 General requirements  

        Section 262 generally requires the following: 


You
must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Spectrian before the vote is taken at the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders. This written demand
for appraisal must be separate from the proxy. In other words, failure to return the proxy or returning the proxy with a notation on it will not alone constitute demand for appraisal. Similarly, a
vote against the merger will not satisfy your obligation to make written demand for appraisal.


You
must not vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement or approval of the merger. If you return a properly executed proxy or otherwise
vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement or approval of the merger, your right to appraisal will terminate, even if you previously filed a written demand for appraisal. You do
not have to vote against the merger in order to preserve your appraisal rights.


You
must continuously hold your shares of Spectrian stock from the date you make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger. 

 Requirements for written demand for appraisal  

        A written demand for appraisal of Spectrian common stock is only effective if it is signed by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns the shares at the time
the demand is made. You should address the written demand to Spectrian Corporation, 350 West Java Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089, Attention: Secretary. It is important that Spectrian receive all
written demands before the vote concerning the merger is taken. The written demand for appraisal should specify the Spectrian stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of shares of stock
owned, and that the Spectrian stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of such stockholder's shares. 

        If
you have complied with the conditions of Section 262, you will be entitled to receive a statement from Spectrian setting forth the number of shares for which appraisal rights
have been exercised and the number of stockholders who own those shares. In order to receive this statement, you must send a written request to Spectrian within 120 days after the closing of
the merger. After the merger, Spectrian will have 10 days after receiving a request to mail the statement to the stockholder. 

 Filing a Petition in the Chancery Court  

        If REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash, within 10 days after the closing of the merger, Spectrian must give written notice
that the merger has become effective to each 

stockholder who has fully complied with the conditions of Section 262. Within 120 days after the closing of the merger, either Spectrian or any stockholder who has complied with the
conditions of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This petition should request that the Chancery Court determine the value of the shares of Spectrian stock held
by all of the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. Because Spectrian has no obligation to file a petition, if you do not file such a petition within 120 days after the closing,
you will lose your rights of appraisal. 

        If
you properly file a petition for appraisal in the Chancery Court and deliver a copy to Spectrian, Spectrian will then have 20 days to provide the Chancery Court with a list of
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal and have not reached an agreement with Spectrian as to the value of their shares. The Chancery Court will then send notice to
all of the stockholders who have demanded appraisal. If the Chancery Court decides it is appropriate, it has the power to conduct a hearing to determine whether the stockholders have fully complied
with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether they are entitled to appraisal under that section. 

        After
the Chancery Court determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights, the Chancery Court will appraise the shares of stock. To determine the fair value of the shares,
the Chancery Court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation or depreciation resulting from the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger. After the Chancery Court determines
the fair value of the shares, it will direct Spectrian to pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal. The Chancery Court can also direct Spectrian to pay interest, simple or
compound, on that value if the Chancery Court determines that interest is appropriate. 

        The
Chancery Court could determine that the fair value of shares of Spectrian stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. In other words, if you demand
appraisal rights, you could receive less consideration than you would under the merger agreement. 

 Loss of stockholder's rights  

        If you demand appraisal, after the closing of the merger you will not be entitled to: 


vote
your shares of stock, for any purpose, for which you have demanded appraisal;


receive
payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to your shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are payable to
holders of record as of a record date before the effective time of the merger; or


receive
the payment of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement. 

        However,
you can regain these rights if no petition for an appraisal is filed within 120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to Spectrian a written withdrawal
of your demand for an appraisal and your acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the closing of the merger or
with the written consent of Spectrian. However, an appraisal proceeding in the Chancery Court cannot be dismissed without the Chancery Court's approval. 

You will not have any appraisal rights unless REMEC elects to pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash. If you fail to comply strictly with these
procedures you will lose your appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your
appraisal rights.

REMEC shareholders  

        The following is a summary of Sections 1300 to and including 1312 of the California General Corporation Law, which sets forth the procedures for REMEC
shareholders to dissent from the merger and to demand statutory appraisal rights under the California General Corporation Law. This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the
provisions of California law relating to the rights of 

REMEC shareholders to an appraisal of the value of their shares and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Sections 1300 to and including 1312 of the California General Corporation Law,
the full text of which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to follow the following procedures exactly could result in the loss of dissenters' rights. 

        Under
Sections 181 and 1201 of the California General Corporation Law, the merger constitutes a "reorganization." Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law
provides appraisal rights for shareholders dissenting from reorganizations in certain circumstances. REMEC shareholders will be entitled to dissent and seek appraisal for their shares of REMEC common
stock if either of the following criteria are satisfied: 


the
shares for which appraisal rights are sought must possess restrictions on transfer (for example, the shares must be "restricted securities" not
registered pursuant to the Securities Act and must not be eligible for unrestricted resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act) 

        OR


5%
or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock (i.e., approximately 2,254,619 shares of REMEC common stock) must dissent from the proposed merger
and demand appraisal. 

        If
you, as a REMEC shareholder, want to dissent from the proposed merger and demand appraisal of your shares of REMEC common stock, you must follow the procedures described below. You
must follow these procedures exactly or your right to dissent may be lost. There are strict time limits associated with your right to dissent and seek appraisal. Note, however, that if your shares do
not possess restrictions on transfer, you will not have the right to dissent unless a total of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock exercise their right to dissent. Since you
will not know whether sufficient shares exercise their right to dissent until after the REMEC special meeting of shareholders, you should comply with the procedures below if you wish to dissent. REMEC
will then advise you whether sufficient shares have dissented. 

        If
you wish to dissent and require us to repurchase your shares of REMEC common stock, you must: 

(a)
make
written demand upon REMEC advising of your desire to dissent from the proposed merger and seek appraisal for your shares of REMEC common stock. REMEC must receive your written
demand not later than the date of the REMEC special meeting of shareholders. You can send this written demand to either REMEC's address as set forth in REMEC's notice of special meeting accompanying
this joint proxy statement/prospectus or to REMEC's transfer agent. REMEC's transfer agent's address is Mellon Shareholder Services, 400 South Hope Street, 4th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90071.
Your written demand must set forth your name and address, the number of shares which you demand that REMEC repurchase and a statement as to what you believe the fair market value of such shares to be
as of the day before the announcement of the proposed merger;

(b)
affirmatively
vote against the proposed merger. If you timely submit to us a written demand for dissent and affirmatively vote against the proposed merger, we will send you a notice
of approval of the merger if (i) shareholder approval for the merger is obtained and (ii) your shares qualify for dissent and appraisal in either manner outlined above; and

(c)
submit,
within 30 days after the date on which the notice of approval of the proposed merger by the REMEC shareholders is mailed to you, at REMEC's principal office or at the
office of REMEC's transfer agent, (i) if the shares for which you are dissenting are certificated, the certificates representing any shares for which you are making demand for repurchase, with
a statement regarding which of the shares are dissenting shares, or (ii) if the shares for which 

you
are dissenting are uncertificated, written notice of the number of shares which you demand that REMEC repurchase. 

        Simply
failing to vote for, or voting against, the proposed merger will not be sufficient to constitute the demand described above. You must exactly follow the procedures described
above. 

        Within
10 days after the date of approval of the proposed merger, REMEC will mail to each appropriately dissenting shareholder the notice of approval of the proposed merger
referenced above, together with a statement of the price determined by REMEC to represent the fair market value of dissenting shares, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed if the
shareholder desires to exercise dissenters' rights under the California General Corporation Law. The statement of the price of the shares will constitute an offer by REMEC to repurchase any dissenting
shares at the price stated therein. If REMEC and the dissenting shareholder agree that the shares are dissenting shares and agree upon the price of the shares, the dissenting shareholder will be
entitled to the agreed price plus interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments from the date of their agreement. Subject to the provisions of the California General Corporation Law, payment of the
fair market value of the dissenting shares will be made within 30 days after agreement or after satisfaction of any statutory or contractual condition, whichever is later, and upon surrender of
the certificates therefor (if certificated) or written notice of repurchase (if uncertificated). 

        If
REMEC denies that the shares are dissenting shares or if REMEC and the dissenting shareholder fail to agree upon the fair market value of the shares, then the dissenting shareholder,
within six months after the date on which notice of approval of the proposed merger by the REMEC shareholders is mailed to the shareholder, and not thereafter, may file a complaint in the Superior
Court of the State of California requesting the court to determine whether the shares are dissenting shares, or the fair market value of the dissenting shares, or both, or may intervene in any pending
action for the appraisal of any shares of REMEC common stock. 

        To
the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 of the California General Corporation Law prevent the payment to any holders of dissenting shares of the fair market value of the
dissenting shares, the dissenting shareholders will become creditors of REMEC for the amount that they otherwise would have received in the repurchase of their dissenting shares, plus interest at the
legal rate on judgments until the date of payment, but subordinate to all other creditors in any liquidation proceeding, with the debt to be payable when permissible under the provisions of Chapter 5
of the California General Corporation Law. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF REMEC CAPITAL STOCK AND SPECTRIAN CAPITAL STOCK    

        REMEC is incorporated under the laws of the State of California and Spectrian is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The rights of Spectrian
stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws. The rights of Spectrian
stockholders who receive REMEC shares as a result of the merger, will be governed by the General Corporation Law of California, REMEC's restated articles of incorporation, REMEC's certificate of
determination, preferences and rights of Series RP Preferred Stock and REMEC's amended and restated bylaws. The following discussion summarizes certain material differences between the rights
of holders of Spectrian common stock and REMEC common stock resulting from the differences in their governing documents and California and Delaware law. 

        The
following summary is not a complete summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to governing corporate documents of REMEC and Spectrian and applicable law. See "Where You
Can Find Additional Information" on page 21. 

Capitalization  

 REMEC  

        The total authorized shares of capital stock of REMEC consist of (1) 140,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and
(2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Of the authorized shares of preferred stock, 140,000 shares are designated Series RP Preferred Stock. 

        REMEC's
restated articles of incorporation provide that shares of REMEC's preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, and authorize the board of directors to
determine the
powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the preferred stock. REMEC's restated articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to increase or
decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. 

 Spectrian  

        The total authorized shares of capital stock of Spectrian consist of (1) 25,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
(2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. Of the authorized shares of preferred stock, 20,000 shares are designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of Spectrian preferred stock may be issued from time to time, in one or more series. Spectrian's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that shares of Spectrian preferred stock, and each series thereof, will have the designations, powers, preferences and rights and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth in the resolutions of the board of directors. The Spectrian board of directors is authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any
series subsequent to the issuance of shares of such series, but not above the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock and not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. 

Number, election, vacancy and removal of directors  

 REMEC  

        REMEC's amended and restated bylaws provide that the authorized number of directors cannot be less than six or more than nine, as determined by the board from
time to time. REMEC currently has six directors. Prior to the completion of the merger, the number of REMEC directors will be increased to eight. All directors are elected at each annual meeting of
shareholders to serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors have been elected and qualified. An amendment to REMEC's amended and restated bylaws that would reduce the minimum number
of directors to less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a shareholders' meeting or the shares not
consenting to an action by written consent are equal to or more than 16

/

 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

        REMEC's
amended and restated bylaws provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors. Under cumulative voting, if any shareholder has given timely notice of an intention to
cumulate votes for the election of directors, such shareholder and any other shareholder of the corporation would be entitled to cumulate his or her votes at such election. Cumulative voting provides
that each share of stock normally having one vote is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected. A shareholder may then cast all such votes for a single candidate or
may allocate them among as many candidates as the shareholder may choose. 

        REMEC's
amended and restated bylaws provide that except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. REMEC's amended and restated bylaws further provide that vacancies occurring in the board by reason of the removal of directors may
be filled only by approval of the shareholders. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors is to be designated in the amended and restated bylaws of
Spectrian. Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that the board of directors will consist of seven members, but may be changed by a duly adopted amendment to Spectrian's amended and restated
bylaws or amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware law permits a board of directors, acting alone, to change the authorized number of directors in the manner provided in the amended
and restated bylaws, unless the number of directors is fixed in the certificate of incorporation (in which case a change in the number of directors may be made only by amendment to the certificate of
incorporation following approval of such change by stockholders). Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that all directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to serve
until the next annual meeting and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for
cumulative voting for the election of directors. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws provide that vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director; provided, however, that a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the stockholders for cause, may be filled by a majority of directors then in office or by the
stockholders. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws provide that any director may be removed from office, with or without cause, by a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of
directors, provided that, so long as stockholders are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no
director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors. 

Amendments to charter documents and bylaws  

 REMEC  

        Under California law, a proposed amendment to a corporation's articles of incorporation generally requires approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote. REMEC's certificate of determination, preferences and rights of Series RP Preferred Stock provides that REMEC's restated articles of incorporation cannot be
amended in any manner that would materially alter or change the power, preferences or special rights of the Series RP Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series RP Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class. 

        REMEC's
amended and restated bylaws provide that they may be amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote or by the board of directors; provided, however, that, a bylaw specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the maximum or minimum number or changing from
a fixed to a variable board, or vice versa, may only be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
contained in the Spectrian amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in the manner prescribed by Delaware law. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that it
cannot be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preference or special rights of the Series A Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely
without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class. Under Delaware law, an
amendment to the certificate of incorporation of a corporation requires the
approval of the board of directors and the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote upon the proposed amendment. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws may be amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders entitled to vote, and Spectrian may in its certificate of
incorporation confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon its directors. Spectrian amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to adopt, alter, amend
or repeal Spectrian's bylaws. 

Action by written consent  

 REMEC  

        REMEC's amended and restated bylaws provide that any action which may be taken at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior
notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that directors may not be elected by written consent expect by
unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws similarly provide that any action which may be taken at any meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and
without prior notice, except as required by the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, if a consent in writing, setting 

forth the actions so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. 

Notice of shareholder actions  

 REMEC  

        REMEC's amended and restated bylaws provide that written notice of the date, time, place and purpose of every meeting of shareholders must be given not less than
10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail or other means of written communication to each shareholder entitled to vote. 

        REMEC's
amended and restated bylaws further provide that any proper matter may be presented at the annual meeting of shareholders for action, but action on the following matters will be
valid only if the proposal was stated in the notice of the meeting or in a written notice, unless the matter was unanimously approved by those entitled to vote: 


the
approval of a contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors or with any corporation, firm, or association in
which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest;


an
amendment to its articles of incorporation;


a
reorganization (as defined in Section 181 of the California General Corporation Law) required to be approved by Section 1201 of the
California General Corporation Law;


the
voluntary winding up and dissolution of the corporation; or


a
plan of distribution under Section 2007 of the California General Corporation Law in respect of a corporation in the process of winding up. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that a written notice of the place, date, time and purpose of all meetings of stockholders must be given not less
than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, either personally or by mail or other means of written communication, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such
meeting. Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws further provide that only such business may be conducted as has been properly brought before a meeting of stockholders. To be properly brought before a
meeting of stockholders, the business must be: 


specified
in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the board of directors;


otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors; or


otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. 

        For
nominations or other business to be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice to the secretary of Spectrian
and the business must be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a notice by a stockholder must be delivered to the secretary of Spectrian not less than 120 days before the
anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or if the date of the annual meeting has changed by more than
30 days from the date of the previous year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of (a) the day
120 days in advance of such meeting, or (b) the day 10 days 

following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. Such notice must set forth a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the
name and address of the stockholder advancing the proposal, the number of shares of Spectrian capital stock beneficially owned by the stockholder, the length of time that the stockholder has held his
or her shares, any material interest of the stockholder in the proposal and such other information concerning the stockholder and the proposal itself as would be required by the appropriate rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the proposal. Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that nominations of
persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a stockholders' meeting by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors who complies with the notice procedure described
above, including providing Spectrian with information regarding the person the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director. 

Special shareholder meetings  

 REMEC  

        Pursuant to REMEC's amended and restated bylaws, a special meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the
President of REMEC, the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at such meeting or such additional persons as are authorized by REMEC's restated articles of incorporation or
the bylaws. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by Spectrian's board of directors or the chairman of
Spectrian's board of directors and that such persons may call a special meeting of stockholders at any time. Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws further provide that only such business may be
considered at a special meeting of stockholders as has been stated in the notice for such meeting. 

Shareholder inspection rights; shareholder lists  

 REMEC  

        California law and REMEC's amended and restated bylaws provide that the accounting books and records of REMEC, and minutes of proceedings of the shareholders, the
board of the directors and committees of the board of directors must be open to inspection during usual business hours upon the written demand of any shareholder or holder of a voting trust
certificate, for a purpose reasonably related to his interests as a shareholder or as the holder of a voting trust certificate. In addition, California law and REMEC's amended and restated bylaws
provide for an absolute right to inspect and copy the corporation's shareholder list by persons holding an aggregate of five percent or more of the corporation's voting shares, or shareholders holding
an aggregate of one percent or more of such shares who have contested the election of directors. REMEC's amended and restated bylaws further
provide that such inspection may be made in person or by an agent or attorney and includes the right to copy and make extracts. 

 Spectrian  

        Under Delaware law, any stockholder, in person or by attorney or other agent, may, upon written demand given under oath and stating the purpose thereof, inspect
for any proper purpose a corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records. A proper purpose is a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a
stockholder. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders must be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of
at least ten days prior to such 

meeting. The list must also be kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 

Monetary liability of directors  

        REMEC's restated articles of incorporation and Spectrian's amended and restated certificate of incorporation each provide for elimination of personal monetary
liability of directors for breach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permissible under the laws of California and Delaware, respectively. The laws of California and Delaware permit corporations
to adopt a provision in their charter documents eliminating the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of the director's fiduciary duty of care
to the corporation and its shareholders. Neither state permits the elimination of liability for breaches of loyalty, for bad faith conduct, for intentional misconduct, transactions from which the
director derives an improper benefit, or for the illegal payment of dividends. California, in addition, prohibits the elimination of liability for conduct that would constitute the reckless disregard
of a director's duty or the director's abdication of duty and transactions in which the director is an interested party. 

Indemnification of directors and officers  

 REMEC  

        Under California law, (a) a corporation has the power to indemnify any person who was or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of
the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and settlements (other than in connection with actions by or in the right of the corporation) if that
person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
the conduct of the person was unlawful, and (b) a corporation has the power to indemnify, with certain exceptions, any person who is a party to any action by or in the right of the corporation,
against expenses actually or reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person believed to be
in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. In addition, California law allows a corporation to advance payment on an indemnitee's expenses prior to the final disposition of an
action, provided that the indemnitee undertakes to repay any such amount advanced if it is later determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification with regard to the action for which
the expenses were advanced. As described above, REMEC's amended and restated bylaws provide for the indemnification of REMEC's directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by California
law. 

        The
indemnification expressly authorized by California law and described above is not exclusive, and a corporation may grant its directors, officers, employees or other agents certain
additional rights to indemnification. REMEC's restated articles of incorporation permit indemnification to the fullest extent not prohibited by California law. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws provide that the corporation will, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, indemnify any person against expenses, judgments, fine, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation. Spectrian's amended and
restated bylaws define a "director" or "officer" as any person (1) who is or was a director or officer of Spectrian, (2) who is or was serving at the request of Spectrian as a director or
officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint 

venture, trust or other enterprise, or (3) who was a director of officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of Spectrian or another enterprise at the request of such
predecessor corporation. Spectrian's amended and restated bylaws only require the corporation to indemnify a director or officer in connection with a proceeding initiated by the director or officer if
the initiation of the proceeding by the director or officer was authorized by Spectrian's board of directors. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws provide that Spectrian will pay the expenses incurred by a director or officer who is entitled to indemnification under Spectrian's amended and
restated bylaws in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, only if such director or officer agrees to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to indemnification. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws further provide that the rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition are not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Spectrian amended and restated certificate of incorporation or
amended and restated bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws also provide that Spectrian may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of Spectrian or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not Spectrian would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under Delaware law. 

        Spectrian's
amended and restated bylaws allow the corporation to indemnify its employees and agents with the same scope and effect as the indemnification of directors and officers. 

Dividends  

 REMEC  

        Under California law, a corporation may not make any distribution to its shareholders unless either: (i) the corporation's retained earnings immediately
prior to the proposed distribution equal or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution; or (ii) immediately after giving effect to such distribution, the corporation's assets (exclusive of
goodwill, capitalized research and development expenses and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 1

/

 times its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and
other deferred credits), and the corporation's current assets would be at least equal to its current liabilities (or 1

/

 times its current liabilities if the average
pre-tax and pre-interest expense earnings for the preceding two fiscal years were less than the average interest expense for such years). Such tests are applied to California
corporations on a consolidated basis. In addition, under California law, a corporation may not make a distribution to its shareholders if the corporation is, or would be as a result of the
distribution, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. 

 Spectrian  

        Delaware law provides that a corporation may pay dividends out of its surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the
dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of the net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, the corporation's
capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. 

Conversion  

        Holders of REMEC common stock and Spectrian common stock have no rights to convert their shares into any other securities. 

Rights plans  

 REMEC  

        Each currently outstanding share of REMEC common stock has attached to it one "REMEC purchase right" issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement between REMEC and
Mellon Investor Services LLC, as rights agent, dates as of June 15, 2001. In addition, each newly issued share of REMEC common stock issued before the REMEC purchase rights became
exercisable (as described below), including the shares issued in the merger, will also have a REMEC purchase right attached to it. No separate certificates evidencing the REMEC purchase rights will be
issued unless and until they become exercisable. 

        Each
REMEC purchase right entitles the holder to buy one 1/1,000 of a share of REMEC's Series RP Preferred Stock at a price of $60 per 1/1,000 of a share, subject to adjustment,
or, under certain
circumstances described below, shares of REMEC common stock or common stock of a third party. The REMEC purchase rights will be exercisable after the earlier to occur of: 


a
person or group of affiliated or associated persons having acquired, without the prior approval of REMEC's board of Directors, beneficial ownership of 15%
or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC's common stock (except pursuant to a tender or exchange offer which is for all outstanding shares of REMEC common stock at a price and on terms which a
majority of certain members of the board determines to be adequate and in the best interests of REMEC, its shareholders and other relevant constituencies) or


ten
days (or such later date as the board may determine) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange
offer the consummation of which would result in a person or group of affiliated or associated persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock. 

        If
a person or group beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock, each holder of a REMEC purchase right may receive, in lieu of shares of
Series RP Preferred Stock, upon exercise of each purchase right then held, shares of REMEC common stock with a market value equal to two times the exercise price of a REMEC purchase right,
except that REMEC purchase rights owned by such acquiring person or group will be void. If, following the date that a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of REMEC common stock, REMEC is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each REMEC purchase right will be exercisable, in lieu of shares of Series RP Preferred Stock, for the
number of the acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the REMEC purchase right. 

        REMEC
may redeem the purchase rights at a price of $0.0001 per REMEC purchase right at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of REMEC common stock. Furthermore, at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of REMEC common stock,
REMEC may amend or supplement any provision of the rights agreement without the approval of any holders of REMEC purchase rights. The REMEC purchase rights expire on June 15, 2011. 

        Based
on the State of Wisconsin Investment Board's, or "SWIB," holdings of REMEC common stock and Spectrian common stock as of May 16, 2002, following the completion of the merger
and 

SWIB's exchange of its shares of Spectrian common stock for shares of REMEC common stock, SWIB will beneficially own more than 15% of REMEC's outstanding common stock immediately after consummation
of the merger. REMEC's board of directors has approved of the acquisition of shares in the merger by SWIB and, therefore, the REMEC purchase rights will not become exercisable as a result of the
completion of the merger. 

 Spectrian  

        Each share of Spectrian common stock has attached to it one right issued pursuant to a Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated October 23, 1996, as
amended and supplemented, between Spectrian and Mellon Investor Services, LLC (formerly known as ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C.), as rights agent. 

        Each
Spectrian right entitles the holder to buy 1/1,000 of a share of Spectrian's Series A Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $126 per unit, subject to adjustment, or,
under certain circumstances described below, shares of Spectrian common stock or common stock of a third party. The Spectrian purchase rights will be exercisable after the earlier of: 


the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by Spectrian's board of directors) after a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the common shares then outstanding, provided that in the case of Kopp Investment Advisors, Inc.,
or Kopp, and SWIB, the tenth day after Kopp or SWIB, whichever the case may be, has acquired beneficial ownership of 30% or more or 20% or more, whichever the case may be, of the common shares then
outstanding or


the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by Spectrian's board of directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange
offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the common shares then outstanding, provided that in the case of Kopp and SWIB, the tenth day after
Kopp or SWIB, whichever the case may be, has acquired beneficial ownership of 30% or more or 20% or more, whichever the case may be, of the common shares then outstanding. 

        If
a person or group beneficially owns 15% or more, or 30% or more in the case of Kopp or 20% or more in the case of SWIB, of the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock, each
holder of a Spectrian purchase right may receive, in lieu of shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, upon exercise of each purchase right then held, shares of Spectrian common stock
with a market value equal to two times the exercise price of a Spectrian purchase right, except that purchase rights owned by such acquiring person or group will be void. If, following the date that a
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more, or 30% or more in the case of Kopp or 20% or more in the case of SWIB, of the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock, Spectrian is
acquired in a merger or other business combination, each Spectrian purchase right will be exercisable, in lieu of shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, for the number of the
acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Spectrian purchase right. 

        Spectrian
may redeem the purchase rights at a price of $0.001 per purchase right at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock or prior to the rights expiration on January 18, 2011. Furthermore, at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a beneficial owner
of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Spectrian common stock, Spectrian may amend or supplement any provision of the rights agreement without the approval of any holders of purchase rights. 

Shareholder approval of certain business combinations  

 REMEC  

        California law provides that holders of nonredeemable common stock must receive nonredeemable common stock in a merger of the corporation with a holder of more
than 50% but less than 90% of such corporation's common stock or such holder's affiliate, unless all of the holders of such common stock consent to the transaction or it is approved by the California
Department of Corporations at a fairness hearing. California law also provides that, in certain circumstances, when a tender offer or proposal for a reorganization or sale of assets is made by an
interested party, an affirmative opinion in writing as to the fairness of the consideration to be paid to the shareholders must be delivered to the shareholders. Further, if a tender of shares or vote
is sought pursuant to an interested party's proposal, and a later proposal is made by another party at least 10 days prior to the date of acceptance of the interested party proposal, the
shareholders must be informed of the later offer and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to withdraw any vote, consent or proxy, or to withdraw any tendered shares. 

 Spectrian  

        Spectrian is subject to the anti-takeover provisions in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These anti-takeover
provisions prohibit business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder, as described below, within three years of the time the interested stockholder became an
interested stockholder unless: 


before
that time, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested
stockholder


upon
completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting
stock of the corporation, excluding shares held by directors who are also officers of the corporation and by employee stock ownership plans that do not permit employees to determine confidentially
whether shares held by the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or


on
or following that time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and the business combination transaction is approved by the holders
of at least 66

/

% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. 

        The
business combination restrictions described above do not apply if a corporation has opted out of the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. A corporation may opt out if: 


the
corporation's original certificate of incorporation contains a provision expressly electing not to be governed by the anti-takeover
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law;


the
holders of a majority of the voting stock of the corporation approve an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to
be governed by the anti-takeover provisions, which election will be effective 12 months after the amendment's adoption and would not apply to any business combination with a person who was
an interested stockholder at or prior to the time the amendment was approved; or


the
corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is (1) listed on a national securities exchange, (2) authorized for quotation on The
Nasdaq National Market or (3) owned by more than 2,000 stockholders of record. 

        Spectrian
has not "opted out" of the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

        The
anti-takeover provisions do not apply to a business combination that: 


is
proposed after the public announcement of, and before the consummation or abandonment of


a
merger or consolidation of the corporation;


a
sale of 50% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate
market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation; or


a
tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation. 


is
with a person who either was not an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of
the board of directors; and


is
approved by a majority of the current directors who were also directors before any person became an interested stockholder during the previous three
years. 

        An
"interested stockholder" generally is defined as a person that owns 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of that person. 

        The
term "business combination" includes the following transactions with an interested stockholder: 


a
merger or consolidation of the corporation with an interested stockholder;


any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, except proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation, of assets of the
corporation or its subsidiaries having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of either the aggregate market value of all assets of the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a
consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding stock of the corporation;


any
transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation or its subsidiaries of stock of the corporation or the subsidiary to the
interested stockholder, except for transactions involving the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities outstanding before the interested stockholder became an
interested stockholder and certain other transactions which do not increase the interested stockholder's proportionate share of any class or series of the corporation's stock;


any
transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries which increases the proportionate share of any class or series of stock, or securities
convertible into the stock of any class or series, of the corporation or any subsidiary which is owned by the interested stockholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share
adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any shares of stock not caused by the interested stockholder; or


any
receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, except proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation, of any loans, advances, guarantees,
pledges or other financial benefits provided by the corporation or its subsidiaries. 

Mergers, sales of assets and other transactions  

 REMEC  

        Under California law, the principal terms of a merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to
vote thereon, except that, unless required by a corporation's articles of incorporation, no authorizing shareholder vote is required of a corporation surviving a merger if the shareholders of such
corporation own, immediately after the 

merger, more than five-sixths of the voting power of the surviving corporation or its parent. REMEC's restated articles of incorporation do not require a greater percentage vote.
California law further requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon if (a) the surviving corporation's articles of incorporation will be
amended and would otherwise require shareholder approval or (b) shareholders of such corporation will receive shares of the surviving corporation having different rights, preferences,
privileges or restrictions (including shares in a foreign corporation) than the shares surrendered. Shareholder approval is not required under California law for mergers or consolidations in which a
parent corporation merges or consolidates with a subsidiary of which it owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of stock. 

 Spectrian  

        Under Delaware law, mergers or consolidations or sales or exchanges of all or substantially all of a corporation's assets or a dissolution of the corporation
require the affirmative vote of the board of directors (except in certain limited circumstances). In addition, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled
to vote on the matter is required, except in certain cases where stockholder approval is not required by a corporation's certificate of incorporation. 

        Under
Delaware law, stockholder consent is not required under the following circumstances: 


for
a corporation that survives a merger and does not issue in the merger more than 20% of its outstanding shares immediately prior to the merger;


if
the merger agreement does not amend in any respect the survivor's certificate of incorporation;


if
each share of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior to the merger remains an identical outstanding share of the surviving corporation
after the merger; and


for
either corporation where one corporation owns 90% of each class of outstanding stock of the other corporation. 

Appraisal rights  

 REMEC  

        Under California law, dissenters' rights are available to holders of a class of shares listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market if
demands for payment are filed with respect to at least five percent of the outstanding shares of that class or there exists any restriction on transfer of such shares imposed by the corporation or by
any law or regulation. Appraisal rights are also unavailable if the shareholders of a corporation or the corporation itself, or both, immediately prior to the reorganization will own immediately after
the reorganization equity securities constituting more
than five-sixths (or 83.3%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring corporation or its parent entity. For more detailed information regarding appraisal rights, see the section
titled "Rights of AppraisalREMEC shareholders" on page 100. A copy of the text of Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law, which sets forth the appraisal rights
of REMEC shareholders, is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

 Spectrian  

        Under Delaware law, a stockholder of a corporation participating in certain major corporate transactions may, under varying circumstances, be entitled to
appraisal rights pursuant to which the stockholder may receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of his or her shares in lieu of the 

consideration he or she would otherwise receive in the transaction. Unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, these appraisal rights are not available: 


with
respect to the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation,


with
respect to a merger or consolidation by the corporation the shares of which are either listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq National
Market or are held of record by more than 2,000 holders if the terms of the merger of consolidation allow the stockholders to receive only shares of the surviving corporation or shares of any other
corporation that are either listed on a national securities exchange or on Nasdaq National Market or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, or


to
stockholders of the corporation surviving a merger if no vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation is required to approve the merger because
the merger agreement does not amend the existing certificate of incorporation, each share of the surviving corporation outstanding prior to the merger is converted into an identical outstanding or
treasury share after the merger, an the number of share to be issued in the merger does not exceed 20% of the shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior to the merger and if
some other conditions are met. 

        A
copy of the text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth the appraisal rights of Spectrian stockholders, is attached as Annex D to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION    

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the acquisition by REMEC of Spectrian using the purchase method of
accounting. As discussed elsewhere, REMEC has the option to pay $4.00 in cash for each common share of Spectrian acquired. The accompanying pro forma condensed combined financial statements also
separately illustrate the effect of exercising this option. Such pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and upon certain assumptions that REMEC's management believes are reasonable
under the circumstances. These pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and therefore are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position
that might have been achieved had the Spectrian acquisition occurred as of an earlier date, nor are they necessarily indicative of operating results or financial position which may occur in the
future. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is provided as of May 3, 2002, giving effect to the Spectrian acquisition as though it had been consummated on that date.
Effective October 26, 2001, REMEC acquired the radio frequency division of ADC Mersum Oy ("Solitra"), a commercial telecommunications company located in Finland, in a transaction accounted for
as a purchase. Accordingly, the historical balance sheet of REMEC as of May 3, 2002 includes the accounts of Solitra. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended January 31, 2002 and the three months ended May 3, 2002 combines the results of
operations of REMEC for the year ended January 31, 2002 and the three months ended May 3, 2002, and the results of operations of Solitra for the period from February 1, 2001
through October 26, 2001 (the acquisition date) with the results of operations of Spectrian for the year and the three months ended March 31, 2002 and gives effect to the Spectrian
acquisition as though it had occurred on February 1, 2001, the beginning of REMEC's fiscal year. 

        REMEC's
condensed financial information included in these pro forma financial statements is derived from its January 31, 2002 audited and May 3, 2002 unaudited consolidated
financial statements included in its Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively, for the same periods. Solitra's financial information included in these pro forma financial
statements is derived from its approximate nine months ended October 31, 2001 unaudited financial statements. Solitra's financial statements included in the pro forma information as of all
dates and for all periods presented have been converted into U.S. dollars and adjusted, where appropriate, to present Solitra's financial position and results of operations in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Spectrian's financial information included in these pro forma financial statements is derived from its March 31, 2002 audited
consolidated financial statements and its March 31, 2002 unaudited quarterly results included in its Form 10-K. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of REMEC, Spectrian and
Solitra included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations for preparing pro forma financial statements, pro forma operating results exclude cumulative effects of
accounting changes, extraordinary items, and discontinued operations. Accordingly, the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $494,000 reported by Spectrian is not presented. 

See accompanying notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
  PRO FORMA BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS    

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, the exchange ratio will be determined as follows: if the average trading price of REMEC's common stock for the
ten-day trading period ending on and including the second business day prior to the Spectrian special meeting of stockholders exceeds $10.50 then the exchange ratio will be 1.33333, if the
average REMEC share price is equal to or lower than $10.50 but equal to or higher than $7.00, the exchange ratio will be equal to the number computed by dividing $14.00 by the average REMEC share
price, and if the average REMEC share price is lower than $7.00 the exchange ratio will be 2.0. In connection with preparing the following unaudited pro forma financial information, REMEC estimates
that it will issue 1.65 shares of common stock for each outstanding common share of Spectrian common stock. Accordingly, assuming a 1.65 exchange ratio, REMEC would issue
18,927,000 shares of common stock and assume options to purchase 4,625,000 equivalent shares of REMEC common stock. Also, REMEC may, at its sole and absolute discretion, elect to pay up to
$4.00 of the per share merger consideration in cash. 

        REMEC
estimates the purchase price to be approximately $190.1 million, which is comprised of the value of the 18,927,000 shares to be issued of $160.6 million, the fair
value of options assumed of $22.6 million, and estimated costs to complete the acquisition of $6.9 million. 

        REMEC
has engaged a third party valuation group to perform a valuation of the inventory, in-process research and development and intangible assets of Spectrian to be
recognized by REMEC in connection with the acquisition in order to allocate the purchase price in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations." This valuation
is in process and the pro forma adjustments included herein related to these tangible and intangible assets to be acquired may change based on the results of the valuation. Subject to the final
analysis, the purchase price has been allocated as follows based upon management's best estimate of the tangible and intangible assets to be acquired, including acquired technology and
in-process research and development.

        REMEC
allocated $5,129,000 of the purchase price to in-process research and development projects. This allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted
cash flows related to incomplete research and development projects. The development of these projects has not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress has no
alternative future uses. The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating
the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The projection used to value the in-process research and development was based on
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by REMEC and its competitors. The resulting net
cash flows from such projects are based on management's estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes from such projects. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their
present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations. Due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with 

the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects, a discount rate of approximately 30% was used to value the in-process research and development. This discount rate was
commensurate with Spectrian's stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the
combined company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of other acquired intangible assets may become impaired. 

        REMEC
believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the in-process research and development analysis are reasonable. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying
assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended January 31, 2002 do not include the $5,129,000 write-off of acquired
in-process research and development as it is a one time charge resulting from the acquisition. It will be included in the actual consolidated statement of operations of REMEC in the period
the transaction is consummated. 

        Deferred
compensation represents the estimated intrinsic value of the unvested options to be assumed. 

        Adjustments
to the above allocation of the purchase price will include changes in the value of the assets, liabilities and deferred compensation between May 19, 2002 and the date
the merger is completed. 

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
