April
    , 2003 

Dear Tumbleweed and Valicert
stockholders: 

The boards of directors of
Tumbleweed Communications Corp. and Valicert, Inc. have approved a merger to combine Tumbleweed and Valicert. On behalf of the boards of directors of Tumbleweed and Valicert, we are pleased to deliver our joint proxy statement/prospectus for the
merger to combine Tumbleweed and Valicert. 

Upon
completion of the merger, holders of Valicert common stock will be entitled to receive 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock for each share of Valicert common stock they hold at that time. Based on the current number of shares of Valicert
common stock outstanding as of the record date, the shares of Tumbleweed common stock to be issued to Valicert stockholders will represent approximately     % of the outstanding stock of Tumbleweed after the merger. Tumbleweed
common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol TMWD. 

Completion of the merger requires Tumbleweed stockholders to approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed stock for the merger and requires Valicert stockholders to adopt and approve the merger
agreement and approve the merger and the related transactions. Tumbleweed stockholders will vote on the issuance of the shares of Tumbleweed common stock pursuant to the merger at the Tumbleweed annual meeting of stockholders. Valicert stockholders
will vote on the merger at the Valicert special meeting of stockholders. 

This is a proxy statement for both the Tumbleweed annual meeting of stockholders and the Valicert special meeting of stockholders. This is also a prospectus for the Tumbleweed common stock to be issued to Valicert
stockholders in the merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the merger. We encourage you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 
In addition, the section entitled 

Risk Factors
 beginning on page 12 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a description of the risks that you should consider in evaluating the merger.

This joint proxy statement also contains information regarding
other matters to be voted upon at the Tumbleweed annual meeting. At the Tumbleweed annual meeting, Tumbleweed stockholders will vote to elect two Class I directors and ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as Tumbleweeds independent auditor for the
2003 fiscal year. 

Whether or not you plan to
attend either of the meetings, please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us. Please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it to us as soon as possible in the enclosed prepaid envelope.

Sincerely, 

Jeffrey C. Smith

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

John Vigouroux

President and Chief Executive Officer

NEITHER
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER, OR DETERMINED IF THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION
TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND OTHER PROPOSALS 

Q:

What will Valicert stockholders receive as a result of the merger? 

A.

If the merger is completed, Valicert stockholders will receive 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock in exchange for each share of Valicert common stock.
Tumbleweed will not issue fractional shares to Valicert stockholders. Instead of fractional shares, Valicert stockholders will receive a cash payment based on the closing price of Tumbleweed stock on the closing date of the merger. 
For example,
if you currently own 100 shares of Valicert common stock, then after the merger you will be entitled to receive 38 shares of Tumbleweed common stock and a check for the market value of the 0.5 fractional share.

Q:

Will Tumbleweed stockholders receive any shares as a result of the merger? 

A.

No. Tumbleweed stockholders will continue to hold the Tumbleweed shares they currently own. 
For example, if you currently own 100 shares of Tumbleweed common
stock, then you will continue to own those 100 shares after the merger.

Q:

What will be the effect of the merger on stock options and warrants to purchase Valicert common stock?

A.

Each outstanding stock option and warrant to acquire Valicert common stock will be converted into an option or warrant to purchase 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed
common stock for each share of Valicert common stock covered by the option or warrant before the merger. The new exercise price of each option and warrant assumed by Tumbleweed in the merger will be determined by dividing the exercise price of such
option or warrant by 0.385, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

Q:

Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A.

No. After we complete the merger, Tumbleweeds exchange agent will send instructions to Valicert stockholders explaining how to exchange their Valicert stock
certificates for Tumbleweed stock certificates. Tumbleweed stockholders will keep their existing stock certificates. 

Q:

What should I do now? 

A.

As soon as possible after you carefully read this document, mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed postage paid return envelope so that your shares may be
represented at your stockholders meeting. You may also attend your companys meeting in person instead of submitting a proxy. 

Q:

What am I being asked to vote upon? 

A:

Tumbleweed stockholders:

1.

You are being asked to approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock under the merger agreement and the transactions associated with the merger.

2.

You are being asked to elect Jeffrey C. Smith and Kenneth R. Klein as Class I directors to serve a three-year term or until their successors are duly elected and
qualified. 

3.

You are being asked to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003. 

Tumbleweeds board of directors unanimously recommends
voting 
FOR
 the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock under the merger agreement and the other proposals listed above. 

vi 



Valicert
stockholders:

You are being asked to adopt
and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger and the related transactions. 

Valicerts board of directors has approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends voting 
FOR
 the proposal listed above. 

Q:

What vote is required to approve the proposals? 

A:

Tumbleweed stockholders:

The approval of the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock and the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as independent
auditors for Tumbleweed for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003, each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock of Tumbleweed present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the
Tumbleweed annual meeting. 

The two director
nominees who receive the greatest number of affirmative votes will be elected as Class I directors of Tumbleweed. 

Valicert stockholders:

The adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the related transactions requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of Valicert. 

Q:

Can I vote for certain proposals and vote against others?

A:

Tumbleweed stockholders may vote FOR certain proposals and you may vote AGAINST other proposals. Your vote on each proposal will be
counted independently. The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon the approval or effecting of the other proposals by the Tumbleweed stockholders set forth above. 

Q:

How will the merger be structured? 

A:

To combine the companies, Valicert will merge with Velocity Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tumbleweed. After the merger is completed, Velocity
Acquisition Sub will cease to exist, and Valicert will survive and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tumbleweed. Within a year following the merger, Tumbleweed will merge Valicert directly into Tumbleweed. Based on the shares outstanding as of the
record date, after the merger is completed, the stockholders of Tumbleweed will own approximately     % of Tumbleweeds common stock and the former stockholders of Valicert will own approximately     % of
Tumbleweeds common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding Tumbleweed and Valicert options and warrants. 

Q:

When do you expect to complete the merger? 

A.

We are working to complete the merger by                     ,
2003. Because the merger is subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions we cannot predict the exact timing. 

Q:

Will I recognize income tax gain or loss on the merger? 

A:

We expect that the merger will generally be tax-free to you for United States federal income tax purposes, other than with respect to cash that Valicert stockholders
may receive instead of fractional shares or in the event that you exercise your appraisal right. To review tax consequences to stockholders in greater detail, see page 93. 

vii 



Q:

What risks should I consider? 

A:

You should review the section of this document entitled Risk Factors on pages 12 through 44. 

Q:

If my shares are held in street name by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me? 

A.

No. If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your street name shares, your broker will not be permitted to vote them on any of
the actions relating to the merger or the issuance of Tumbleweed shares proposed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If you are a Tumbleweed stockholder and do not give voting instructions to your broker, your broker may not vote your shares
on these proposals without instructions from you, and you will not be counted as voting for these proposals unless you appear in person at the Tumbleweed meeting with a legal, valid proxy from the record holder. If you are a Valicert stockholder and
do not give voting instructions to your broker, you will, in effect, be voting against the merger unless you make arrangements to vote, and do vote, the shares personally. You should therefore be sure to provide your broker with instructions on how
to vote your shares. 

Q:

Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card? 

A.

Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your companys stockholder meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

    timely delivery of a valid, later-dated proxy; 

    written notice to your companys secretary before the meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or 

    voting by ballot at either the Tumbleweed annual meeting or the Valicert
special meeting. 

If you have instructed a broker
to vote your shares, you must follow directions from your broker to change those instructions. 

Q:

Whom can I call with questions about the merger? 

A.

If you are a Valicert stockholder with questions about the merger, please call Timothy Conley, Chief Financial Officer, at (650) 567-5400. If you are an Tumbleweed
stockholder with questions about the merger, please call Tumbleweed Investor Relations at (650) 216-2134.

subsidiary of Tumbleweed. Within a year following the merger, Tumbleweed will merge Valicert directly into Tumbleweed. Based on the shares outstanding as of the record date, after the merger is completed, the stockholders of Tumbleweed will own
approximately 

% of Tumbleweeds common stock and the former stockholders of Valicert will own approximately 

% of Tumbleweeds common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding
Tumbleweed and Valicert options and warrants. 

REASONS FOR THE MERGER 

The Tumbleweed and Valicert boards of directors have determined that the merger agreement and the related transactions, including, in the case of Tumbleweed, the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock to Valicert stockholders,
are in the best interests of their respective stockholders. 

The proposed merger offers a strategic growth opportunity for each company. Currently, Tumbleweed and Valicert each provide solutions that address specific parts of the Internet business communication system: 



Tumbleweed provides secure messaging applications over the Internet; and 



Valicert provides secure data transfer and identity validation applications. 

Combining Tumbleweed and Valicert is expected to create the following benefits: 



increased product breadth in secure Internet communication solutions from a single supplier; 





combined depth of experience of the employees in solving customer problems; 



combined technological skills and domain expertise in developing secure Internet communication solutions; 



improved financial strength during this period of slow market growth and increasing industry consolidation; 



opportunities to reduce overlapping, redundant costs and infrastructure to enhance efficient use of funds; 



opportunities to accelerate sales growth by selling products to each others customers; and 



an enhanced position in a more broadly defined secure Internet communication market. 

To review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, as well as related uncertainties, see pages 53
through 57.

PROPOSAL 1: THE MERGER 

What Valicert Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger 

As a result of the merger, Valicert stockholders will receive 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock for each share of Valicert common stock that they own. Valicert stockholders will not receive
fractional shares. Instead, they will receive a check in payment for any fractional share based on the market price of Tumbleweed common stock on the date of the completion of the merger. 

In addition, at the time the merger is completed, holders of Valicert warrants and stock options will have
their warrants and options converted into warrants or options to purchase 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock for each outstanding share of Valicert common stock subject to an existing warrant or option at that time. The exercise price of
such converted warrant or option will also be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. 

Do not send in your stock certificates now. When the merger is completed, Valicert stockholders will receive written instructions for exchanging their Valicert stock certificates. Tumbleweed
stockholders will continue to hold their Tumbleweed stock certificates. 

Status of Valicert Following the Merger 

If the merger is approved, a subsidiary of Tumbleweed will merge with and into Valicert, and Valicert will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tumbleweed. Stockholders of Valicert before the merger will own stock in
Tumbleweed after the merger. Within a year following the merger, Tumbleweed will merge Valicert directly into Tumbleweed. 

Ownership of Tumbleweed Following the Merger 

Based on shares outstanding as of the record date, the shares of Tumbleweed common stock issued to Valicert stockholders in the merger will constitute approximately     % of
the outstanding common stock of Tumbleweed after the merger, and the current stockholders of Tumbleweed will hold the remaining approximately     % of the outstanding common stock of Tumbleweed after the merger, assuming no
exercise of outstanding Tumbleweed and Valicert options and warrants. 

Conditions 

The
merger will not be completed unless certain conditions are met, including the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger and the related transactions by Valicert stockholders and the approval of the issuance of shares of
Tumbleweed common stock by Tumbleweed stockholders, no event has occurred that has had a material adverse effect on Tumbleweed or Valicert, and Tumbleweed and Valicert have each performed in all material respects their respective obligations under
the merger agreement. Some conditions may be waived. 

No Solicitation of Transactions 

Valicert has agreed, subject to some exceptions, not to initiate or engage in discussions with a third party regarding a business combination with the third party while the merger is pending. 

Termination 

Tumbleweed and Valicert may together agree to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger, whether or not their respective stockholders have approved the merger agreement. 

The merger agreement may also be terminated by the board of
directors of either company in other circumstances, including: 



if the merger is not completed on or before September 15, 2003, except that neither 



Tumbleweed nor Valicert may terminate the merger agreement if its breach of the merger agreement is the reason the merger has not been
completed by that date; 



if the requisite approval of the stockholders of Tumbleweed or Valicert is not obtained; 



if any necessary regulatory approvals are not obtained; 



if either partys board of directors has failed to recommend the merger to its stockholders or has withdrawn or adversely modified or qualified its
recommendation of the merger; or 



if the other party has failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. 

Termination Fee 

The merger agreement requires Valicert to pay to Tumbleweed a termination fee of $1.0 million if the agreement is terminated because Valicerts board of directors has failed to recommend the merger to its stockholders or has
withdrawn or adversely modified or qualified its recommendation of the merger. 

Covenants 

Tumbleweed and Valicert have agreed to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course, maintain existing relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and partners and undertake certain other agreed upon actions
prior to the closing of the merger. Tumbleweed and Valicert have also agreed to cooperate in their efforts to complete the merger, including providing reasonable access to information prior to the merger. 

Interests of Persons in the Merger 

In considering the boards recommendations that you vote to approve the merger, you should note that the directors and officers of Valicert have continuing indemnification against specified liabilities. 

Additionally, some of the Valicert directors and officers also
participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, stockholders of Valicert 
generally. These arrangements include the
automatic vesting of currently unvested stock options, and additional compensation and severance agreements. As a result, these directors and officers may be more likely to vote to approve the merger agreement than stockholders of Valicert
generally. 

Finally, one of the Tumbleweed
directors is affiliated with a significant stockholder of Valicert. As a result, this director may have been more likely to vote to approve the merger agreement than stockholders of Tumbleweed generally. 

Appraisal Rights for Valicert Stockholders 

If the merger is consummated, Valicert stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Delaware law and may also be entitled to seek appraisal rights under
California law. For further information, see page 73. 

Important Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The exchange of Valicert common stock for Tumbleweed common stock, other than cash paid for fractional shares or in the event you exercise appraisal rights, is expected to be tax-free to Valicert stockholders for Federal
income tax purposes. 

Tax matters are very
complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own personal circumstances. You should consult your tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the merger to you. For further information, see
page 93. 

Anticipated Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the cost to acquire Valicert will be
allocated to the tangible and identifiable, intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, with any excess being treated as goodwill. Goodwill is no longer subject to periodic amortization, but rather subject to at
least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair-value based test. Identified intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized over those lives. 



Risks of the Merger 

In considering whether to approve the merger agreement, you should consider various risks of the merger, including 



the risk of fluctuations in the market price of Tumbleweed common stock; 



risks associated with the merger and integrating the companies businesses; and 



the fact that some directors and officers of Valicert and Tumbleweed may have interests in the merger that are different from or in addition to yours.

We urge you to read carefully the
factors described in Risk Factors on pages 12 through 44 in making your decision. 

Opinions of Financial Advisors 

In deciding to approve the merger, the boards of directors of each of Tumbleweed and Valicert considered opinions from their respective financial advisors as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, as of the date of the opinions, to
the respective companies from a financial point of view. 

The Tumbleweed board of directors received an opinion from its financial advisor, RBC Capital Markets, and the Valicert board of directors received an opinion from its financial advisor, SoundView Technology Corporation.

These opinions, which set forth the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations set on the scope of the review undertaken are attached as Annexes B and C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

We encourage you to read these opinions. 

Board Composition Following The Merger 

Tumbleweed has agreed to take the necessary corporate action to appoint an additional director who has been designated by Valicert to serve on Tumbleweeds board of directors upon approval by Tumbleweeds and
Valicerts respective boards.

also be governed by specific provisions of California law. If the merger is completed, the rights of former Valicert stockholders who become Tumbleweed stockholders will be determined by Tumbleweeds certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
which differ in some respects from Valicerts certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE 

This joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the risk factors in this section, and other communications to stockholders of Tumbleweed and Valicert, respectively, may contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. These statements relate to, among other things, consummation of the merger, the future business,
financial condition and results of operations of the combined company, and benefits of the pending merger. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should,
plans, believes, expects, anticipates, estimates predicts, potential, or continue, or the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology,
including, without limitation: 



any projections of revenues, earnings, synergies or other financial items; 



any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; 



any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; 



any statements relating to integration or restructuring plans; 



any statements of belief; and 



any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. 

These statements are only predictions, not historical facts. Actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Tumbleweed and Valicert are not under any obligation (and
expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter their respective forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Before making a decision regarding the merger, you should be aware that the
occurrence of the events described in the risk factors could harm the business, results of operations and financial condition of Tumbleweed, Valicert or the combined company. 



RISK FACTORS 

You
should carefully consider the risks described below regarding the merger and the respective businesses of Tumbleweed and Valicert, together with all of the other information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, before making a decision
about voting on the proposals submitted for your consideration. By voting in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the related transactions, you will be choosing to invest in Tumbleweed common
stock. 

Risks Related to the Merger 

Fluctuations in stock prices could decrease the value of the Tumbleweed common stock to be issued in the merger. 

Stockholders of Valicert will receive 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock for each share of Valicert common stock that they own
regardless of any increase or decrease in the price of the common stock of either Tumbleweed or Valicert. The price of Tumbleweed common stock at the time the merger is completed may be higher or lower than its price as of todays date or at
the date of Tumbleweeds annual meeting of stockholders and Valicerts special meeting of stockholders. Accordingly, the specific dollar value of the Tumbleweed common stock to be received by Valicert stockholders upon completion of the
merger will depend on the market value of the Tumbleweed stock at the time of completion of the merger. The price of Tumbleweed common stock could change due to changes in the business, operations or prospects of Tumbleweed or Valicert, market
assessments of the merger, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions or other factors. As a result, the value of the 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock issuable in respect of a share of Valicert common stock may not
equal or exceed the market value of a share of Valicert common stock. Similarly, there can be no assurance to Tumbleweed stockholders that the value of the 0.385 of a share of Tumbleweed common stock may not equal or be less than the market value of
a share of Valicert common stock. We urge the stockholders of Tumbleweed and Valicert to obtain current market quotations for Tumbleweed common stock and Valicert common stock. 

The combined company must succeed in the Internet business communications system market if it is to
realize the expected benefits of the merger. 

The combined companys strategic plan depends upon the successful development and introduction of products and solutions that address the needs of the Internet business communication systems market. In order for the combined
company to succeed in this developing market, it must align strategies and objectives and focus a significant portion of its resources towards serving this market. 

The challenges involved in this integration include the following: 



coordinating software development operations in a rapid and efficient manner to ensure timely release of products to market; 



combining product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively; 



successfully managing difficulties associated with transitioning current customers to new product lines; 



demonstrating to our customers that the merger will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus; 



retaining key alliances; and 



persuading our employees that Tumbleweeds and Valicerts business cultures are compatible. 



In addition,
the combined companys success in this new market will depend on several factors, many of which are outside the combined companys control, including: 



continued growth of the Internet business communication systems market; 



deployment of the combined companys products by enterprises; 



promotion of the combined companys products by partners and resellers; and 



the emergence of substitute technologies and products. 

The failure of the combined company to succeed in this market would significantly harm its business and prevent it from realizing the
anticipated benefits of the merger. 

The
combined company may not be able to successfully integrate their business operations. 

Although the Tumbleweed and Valicert boards of directors have each determined that the merger is in the best interests of their respective stockholders, the integration of the two companies will
involve special risks relating to integration of the two companies sales forces and existing technology infrastructures. The merger will not achieve its anticipated benefits unless Tumbleweed successfully combines its operations with those of
Valicert and integrates the two companies product solutions in a timely manner. Integrating Tumbleweed and Valicert will be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and may result in revenue disruption and operational difficulties if
not completed in a timely and efficient manner. Prior to the merger, Tumbleweed and Valicert operated independently, each with its own business, business culture, markets, clients, employees and systems. Following the merger, the combined company
may have difficulty retaining the customers of the combined businesses and assimilating and retaining personnel. In addition, the integration of the operations and systems of the two companies and the realization of potential increased efficiencies
may prove difficult and may cause managements attention to be diverted from other business concerns. These and other difficulties associated with the merger may lead to potential adverse effects on operating results of the combined company.

In addition, beginning in 2002, Valicert shifted
the focus of its business strategy to focus primarily on its secure transport and validation authority software products. As a result, it has been reallocating engineering, marketing and sales resources over the past 12 months. Upon consumption of
the merger, the combined company is planning to continue to focus on this new strategy. If the combined company is unable to execute its new business strategy, the attention of the combined companys management may be diverted, which will hurt
the operations of the combined company. 

The
merger could adversely affect the combined companys financial results. 

If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the merger, including any dilution to Tumbleweeds stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the
merger, Tumbleweeds financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected. Tumbleweed expects to incur an in-process research and development charge of approximately $121,000 related to the merger and amortization for
six months of 2003 and annual amortization for 2004 of approximately $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to intangible assets. These numbers are estimates that are subject to change. 

The product integration efforts of the combined company may
be hindered by a variety of technical factors. 

The integration of products from each company may result in unanticipated architectural incompatibilities that would require additional time and engineering resources to resolve. The loss of key engineering personnel from either
company may increase the time and resources needed to resolve these and other technical integration issues. To the extent that technical personnel from each company collaborate in the future, the identification and resolution of any previously
divergent technical standards used by each companys personnel, as well as the implementation of common product development practices and standards, may result in unanticipated product 



development delays. In addition, the installation of integrated or complementary software products at each companys customer sites may
result in difficulties associated with customer-specific installation processes. 

If Tumbleweed fails to efficiently combine Valicerts and Tumbleweeds sales and marketing forces, its sales could suffer. 

Tumbleweed may experience disruption in sales and marketing in connection with its efforts to integrate
Valicerts sales channels, and it may be unable to efficiently or effectively correct such disruption or achieve its sales and marketing objectives after integration. Any such disruptions could cause Tumbleweed to fail to achieve the
anticipated benefits of the merger. 

The
combined company may experience operational difficulties as a result of employee uncertainty regarding the merger. 

Until the combined company announces its strategies, Tumbleweed and Valicert employees may experience uncertainty about their future role
with the combined company. As a result, the combined company may experience operational difficulties, costs and delays resulting from: 



persuading our employees that Tumbleweeds and Valicerts business cultures are compatible; and 



motivating and retaining the employees of the combined company, particularly key management, technical, sales and customer support personnel.

Customer uncertainty related to
the merger could harm the combined company. 

Tumbleweeds or Valicerts customers may, in response to the announcement of the merger, delay or defer purchasing decisions. Any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by Tumbleweeds or Valicerts customers
could adversely affect the business of the combined company. 

The interests of Valicert officers and directors in the merger may differ from other stockholders. 

Some executive officers and directors of Valicert will receive benefits in connection with the merger that are different from those held
by Valicert stockholders generally. These benefits include the automatic vesting of currently unexercisable stock options and additional compensation and severance agreements. 

In addition, as a result of the merger, Valicert directors and officers may be able to achieve liquidity of
their investment sooner than they would be able to otherwise. John Vigouroux, David Jevans, Tim Conley, Denis Brotzel and Srinivasan (Chini) Krishnan, each of whom are executive officers of Valicert, have received offers of employment
from Tumbleweed, which include bonuses and severance arrangements. Joseph (Yosi) Amram, a director of Valicert, will also receive a bonus and acceleration of vesting of certain of his stock options. In addition, the Valicert officers and
directors have continuing indemnification against specified liabilities. As a result, these Valicert officers and directors may be more likely to vote to approve the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it than Valicert stockholders
generally. 

Tumbleweed and Valicert expect to
incur significant costs associated with the merger. 

Tumbleweed estimates that it will incur direct transaction costs of approximately $1.6 million associated with the merger, which will be included as a part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes. In addition, Valicert
estimates that it will incur direct transaction costs estimated to be $1.0 million which will be expensed as incurred. A portion of the Valicert costs will be determined upon the closing. Tumbleweed and Valicert believe the combined entity may incur
charges to operations, which are not currently reasonably estimable, in the quarter in which the merger is completed or the following quarters, to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies. There can be no assurance that the
combined company will not incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the merger. 



The price
of Tumbleweed common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of Valicert. 

When the merger is completed, holders of Valicert common stock will become holders of Tumbleweed common stock. Tumbleweeds business
differs from that of Valicert, and Tumbleweeds results of operations, as well as the price of Tumbleweed common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting Valicert results of operations and the price of Valicert
common stock. 

If the conditions to the merger
are not met, the merger may not occur. 

Even
if the stockholders of Tumbleweed and Valicert approve the merger, there are several conditions that must be either satisfied or waived in order to complete the merger. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur or may
be delayed, and Tumbleweed and Valicert each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger. For example, if either partys representations and warranties are not accurate or complete at the closing of the merger so as to have a
material adverse effect on such party, or if either party suffers a material adverse effect in its condition prior to closing, the other party may choose not to go forward with the merger. If the merger is not completed, Valicert may require
substantial additional capital resources to continue its business, which resources may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. 

Failure to complete the merger could cause Tumbleweeds and Valicerts stock price to decline and could harm
Tumbleweeds and Valicerts businesses and results of operations. 

The merger agreement contains conditions which Tumbleweed and/or Valicert must meet in order to consummate the merger. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by either party upon the
occurrence of certain events described in the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed for any reason, Tumbleweed and Valicert may be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 



the current market price of Tumbleweed and Valicert common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed, and a failure to complete the
merger could result in a decline in market price; 



many costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and financial printing fees, must be paid regardless of whether the merger is
completed; and 



there may be substantial disruption to the business of Tumbleweed and Valicert and a distraction of their workforce and management teams from day-to-day operations.

The interests of a Tumbleweed
director in the merger may differ from other stockholders. 

David F. Marquardt, a member of the Tumbleweed board of directors, is a founding general partner of August Capital L.P. August Capital L.P. and related parties owned approximately 8% of the outstanding common stock of Valicert, as of
December 31, 2002. As a result, this director may have been more likely to vote to approve the merger agreement and the related transactions than Tumbleweed stockholders generally. 

Risks Related to Tumbleweed 

Tumbleweed has a history of losses and may experience continued losses. 

Tumbleweeds prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies engaged in new and rapidly evolving technology markets like
Tumbleweeds. Tumbleweed incurred net losses of $20.9 million, $114.2 million, and $69.8 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, Tumbleweed had incurred cumulative net losses of $270.1 million. 



Tumbleweeds success may depend in large part upon increased adoption and utilization of Tumbleweeds products and technology, as well as Tumbleweeds ability to effectively maintain existing relationships and develop
new relationships with customers and strategic partners. If Tumbleweed does not succeed, it may not achieve or maintain profitability on a timely basis or at all. In particular, Tumbleweed intends to expend significant financial and management
resources on product development, sales and marketing, strategic relationships, technology and operating infrastructure. As a result, Tumbleweed may incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future.

Tumbleweeds quarterly financial results
are subject to significant fluctuations. 

Tumbleweeds revenue has fluctuated and Tumbleweeds quarterly operating results will continue to fluctuate based on the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter. Tumbleweeds
ability to receive revenue from services is subject to multiple risks, including the risk that Tumbleweed may not be able to meet increasing customer demand because of a lack of adequately trained personnel, and the risk that customers may not
timely accept the services provided and delay payment for such services. In addition, Tumbleweed has experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter for other reasons,
including, but not limited to: 



the substantial decrease in information technology spending in general, and among Tumbleweeds target customers in particular; 



customers choosing to delay their purchase commitments or purchase in smaller amounts than expected due to a general downturn in the economy;



Tumbleweeds ability to continue to license its patents, the timing of such licenses, and the costs necessary to defend its patents; 



the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to Tumbleweeds business, operations and infrastructure, including its international
operations; 



Tumbleweeds ability to accurately estimate and control costs; 



Tumbleweeds ability to timely collect fees owed by customers; 



the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in the secure content management, content security, secure online communications, or
document delivery markets; and 



acquisitions that Tumbleweed completes or proposes. 

As a result of these factors, Tumbleweed believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its revenue and operating results are not
necessarily meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance. Tumbleweed may not be able to accurately forecast its revenue or expenses. Because Tumbleweeds staffing and operating expenses are based
on anticipated revenue levels, and because a high percentage of Tumbleweeds costs are fixed, small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
In addition, many of Tumbleweeds customers delay purchases of Tumbleweeds products until the end of each quarter. If Tumbleweed is unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, any
significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on Tumbleweeds operating results. Moreover, Tumbleweed believes the difficulties outlined above with respect to financial forecasts also apply to securities analysts
that may publish estimates of Tumbleweeds financial results. Tumbleweeds operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors due to any of a wide variety of factors,
including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure Tumbleweeds performance. If this occurs, Tumbleweed would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of Tumbleweeds stock.



Economic
conditions could adversely affect Tumbleweeds revenue growth. 

The revenue growth and profitability of Tumbleweeds business depends on the overall demand for Tumbleweeds products, Tumbleweeds intellectual property, and Tumbleweeds services, particularly within
the industries in which Tumbleweed offers specific versions of Tumbleweeds products. Because Tumbleweeds sales are primarily to customers in the financial services, health care, and government industries, Tumbleweeds business
depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries. The progressive weakening of the global economy, the information technology industry in particular, and the weakening of the business
conditions within the above industries has caused a decrease in Tumbleweeds license revenues. A softening of demand for information technology spending caused by a continued weakening of the economy, domestically or internationally, may result
in a continued decrease in revenues. 

In
addition, the financial, political, economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the United States have led to a further weakening of the global economy, and have created an uncertain economic environment. Tumbleweed cannot
predict the impact of these events, any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action, on Tumbleweeds customers or business. Subsequent terrorist acts and/or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities
involving the United States or other countries could adversely affect spending on information technology and on Tumbleweeds software license revenue, as well as have an adverse effect on Tumbleweeds business, financial condition or
results of operations. 

Tumbleweed may have
insufficient cash reserves to see it through to profitability. 

As of December 31, 2002, Tumbleweed had cash and cash equivalents of $29.2 million and had incurred cumulative net losses since inception of $270.1 million. Tumbleweeds current cash reserves, especially in light of
Tumbleweeds $10.0 million stock repurchase program authorized in August of 2002, may be insufficient if Tumbleweed experiences either lower than expected revenues or extraordinary or unexpected cash expenses. As a result, Tumbleweed may be
required to raise funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Funding, if needed, however, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, Tumbleweed may be
required to curtail significantly or defer one or more of Tumbleweeds operating goals or programs, or take other steps that could harm Tumbleweeds business. 

Failure to obtain needed financing could affect Tumbleweeds ability to maintain current operations
and pursue future growth, and the terms of any financing Tumbleweed obtains may impair the rights of Tumbleweeds existing stockholders. 

In the future, Tumbleweed may be required to seek additional financing to fund its operations. Factors such as the commercial success of
Tumbleweeds existing products and services, the timing and success of any new products and services, the progress of Tumbleweeds research and development efforts, Tumbleweeds results of operations, the status of competitive
products and services, and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than Tumbleweed expects. In the event that
Tumbleweed requires additional cash, Tumbleweed may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, especially in light of the uncertainty in the current market environment, and Tumbleweed may not be successful in
implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve its cash position. If Tumbleweed raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of Tumbleweeds stockholders would
be reduced and the securities Tumbleweed issues might have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of Tumbleweeds current stockholders. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, Tumbleweeds ability to achieve
or sustain positive cash flows, maintain current operations, fund any potential expansion, take advantage of new opportunities, develop or enhance products or services, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited.



A limited
number of customers account for a high percentage of Tumbleweeds revenue, and the failure to maintain or expand these relationships could harm Tumbleweeds business. 

The loss of one or more of Tumbleweeds major customers, the failure to attract new customers on a
timely basis or a reduction in usage and revenue associated with the existing or proposed customers would harm Tumbleweeds business and prospects. For 2002, 2001, and 2000, five customers comprised approximately 23%, 17%, and 20%,
respectively, of Tumbleweeds revenue. For 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, no single customer comprised 10% or more of Tumbleweeds revenue. 

Tumbleweed faces risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions, including Tumbleweeds proposed acquisition of Valicert.

Tumbleweed is continuously evaluating
investments in complementary technologies and businesses. Acquisitions of companies, divisions of companies, or products, including Tumbleweeds acquisition of Valicert, entail numerous risks, including: 



potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration;



diversion of managements attention; 



loss of key employees of acquired operations; 



coordinating sales and pricing efforts to effectively communicate the value and capabilities of the combined company; 



the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies; 



the potential disruption of Tumbleweeds ongoing business; 



unanticipated expenses related to such integration; 



the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in-process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which
must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset; 



the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or Tumbleweeds business; 



the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business; and 



inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities. 

As a result of acquisitions, Tumbleweed may acquire significant assets that include goodwill and other
purchased intangibles. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these
assets. Any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm Tumbleweeds growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on Tumbleweeds business and financial condition. 

Tumbleweed faces technical, operational and strategic
challenges that may prevent it from successfully integrating the proposed acquisition of Valicert, or any other company Tumbleweed may acquire. 

The integration of the Valicert business, including its technology, operations and personnel, will be a complex, time-consuming and
expensive process that may disrupt Tumbleweeds business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. Additionally, the integration of any other company or business Tumbleweed may acquire in the future may be a complex, time consuming and
expensive process that may disrupt Tumbleweeds 



business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. Whenever an acquisition is completed, Tumbleweed must operate as a combined
organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices. Tumbleweed may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in integrating the operations
of Valicert, or any other company, including: 



potential incompatibility of business cultures; 



perceived adverse changes in business focus; 



potential conflicts in customer, advertising or strategic relationships; 



potential failure to complete anticipated sales; and 



the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns. 

As a result, Tumbleweed may not be successful in integrating
Valicert or any other business or technologies Tumbleweed acquires and may not achieve anticipated revenue and costs benefits. Tumbleweed also cannot guarantee that these acquisitions will result in sufficient revenues or earnings to justify
Tumbleweeds investment in, or expenses related to, the acquisition. Nor can Tumbleweed guarantee that any anticipated synergies will develop. If Tumbleweed fails to execute its acquisition strategy successfully for any reason,
Tumbleweeds business will suffer. 

If
Tumbleweed does not secure key relationships with enterprise customers, Tumbleweeds access to broader markets will be limited. 

Tumbleweeds enterprise customers, which use or intend to use Tumbleweeds products to intelligently manage the incoming and
outgoing online communications of their enterprises, are a significant source of Tumbleweeds revenue. A key aspect of Tumbleweeds strategy is to access target markets prior to adoption of alternative solutions by the larger participants
in these markets. The failure to secure key relationships with new enterprise customers in targeted markets could limit or effectively preclude Tumbleweeds entry into these target markets, which would harm Tumbleweeds business and
prospects. 

Customers in a preliminary phase
of implementing Tumbleweeds product may not proceed on a timely basis or at all. 

Some of Tumbleweeds customers are currently in a pre-production or pre-launch stage of implementing Tumbleweeds products and may encounter delays or other problems in introducing them. A
customers decision not to do so or a delay in implementation could result in a delay or loss in related revenue or otherwise harm Tumbleweeds businesses and prospects. Tumbleweed cannot predict when any customer that is currently in a
pilot or preliminary phase will implement broader use of Tumbleweeds services. 

The markets for secure messaging applications generally, and for Tumbleweeds products specifically, are new and may not develop. 

The market for Tumbleweeds products and services is new
and evolving rapidly. If the market for Tumbleweeds products and services fails to develop and grow, or if Tumbleweeds products and services do not gain broad market acceptance, Tumbleweeds business and prospects will be harmed. In
particular, Tumbleweeds success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers and their end-users of secure messaging applications. Tumbleweeds success will also depend upon acceptance of Tumbleweeds
technology as the standard for providing these services. The adoption and use of Tumbleweeds products and services will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information. In some cases,
Tumbleweeds customers have little experience with products, services and technology like those offered by us. 



Tumbleweeds ability to influence usage of its products and services by customers and end-users is limited. For example, the usage of Secure Messenger by the end-users of Tumbleweeds service provider customers has been
limited to date. Tumbleweed has spent, and intend to continue to spend, considerable resources educating potential customers and their end-users about the value of Tumbleweeds products and services. It is difficult to assess, or to predict
with any assurance, the present and future size of the potential market for Tumbleweeds products and services, or Tumbleweeds growth rate, if any. Moreover, Tumbleweed cannot predict whether Tumbleweeds products and services will
achieve any market acceptance. For example, as email has become increasingly widespread and accepted, current and potential customers may be more willing to accept related security risks with email, as opposed to utilizing Tumbleweeds
products. Tumbleweeds ability to achieve its goals also depends upon rapid market acceptance of future enhancements of Tumbleweeds products and Tumbleweeds ability to identify new markets as they emerge. Any enhancement that is not
favorably received by customers and end-users may not be profitable and, furthermore, could damage Tumbleweeds reputation or brand name. Any failure to identify and address new market opportunities could harm Tumbleweeds business and
prospects. 

The markets Tumbleweed addresses
are highly competitive and rapidly changing, and Tumbleweed may not be able to compete successfully. 

Tumbleweed may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the multiple competitive pressures
Tumbleweed faces could harm Tumbleweeds business and prospects. The markets in which Tumbleweed competes are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. 

The principal competitive factors in Tumbleweeds industry include price, product functionality, product integration, platform
coverage and ability to scale, worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support. Some of Tumbleweeds competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than Tumbleweed does, as well as greater name
recognition and a larger installed customer base. Additionally, some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines Tumbleweed markets and
distributes. Tumbleweed expects that the market for secure messaging applications will become more consolidated with larger companies being better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term. As this market continues to develop, a
number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with Tumbleweeds competitors or business partners. Tumbleweeds success will depend
on its ability to adapt to these competing forces, to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than Tumbleweeds competitors, and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing Tumbleweeds products
rather than developing their own products. Competitors could introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices than Tumbleweeds products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more
established products in order to compete with us. In addition, because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market, Tumbleweed expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies. Increased competition
is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm Tumbleweeds business. 

Changing Tumbleweeds sales distribution model from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan may
reduce Tumbleweeds revenue in future periods. 

During 2002, Tumbleweed transitioned from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan due to sustained declines in the operating results of those regions. In Europe, Tumbleweed is winding down its direct
sales operations and has signed a reseller agreement with a distributor to sell Tumbleweeds products and provide technical support to Tumbleweeds customers there. In Japan, Tumbleweed transitioned to an indirect sales distribution model
and began the liquidation of its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan, Tumbleweed Communications KK. Tumbleweed Communications KK ceased operations in August 2002 and formally declared bankruptcy in December 2002. Revenue from Tumbleweeds
international regions in Europe and Asia may decrease on a year-over-year basis in future years as a result of this transition. 



Restructuring of operations and other cost reducing measures Tumbleweed has implemented may not achieve the results Tumbleweed intends and even may harm Tumbleweeds business. 

In January 2001, Tumbleweed announced a restructuring of its
business, which included a reduction in force and the closure of three international locations. Since that time Tumbleweed has reduced its work force from more than 400 employees to approximately 135 employees and has engaged in other ongoing
measures to reduce expenses and establish an enterprise that is appropriate for Tumbleweeds expected revenue levels. The planning and implementation of these efforts have placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on
Tumbleweeds managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Additionally, the actions undertaken to restructure the business may negatively affect Tumbleweeds revenue stream, customer satisfaction, employee turnover, recruiting
and retention of important employees. If Tumbleweed experiences difficulties in carrying out the restructuring, Tumbleweeds expenses could increase more quickly than Tumbleweed expects. If Tumbleweed finds that the actions taken to date did
not sufficiently decrease Tumbleweeds expenses, Tumbleweed may find it necessary to implement further streamlining of Tumbleweeds expenses, to perform additional reductions in Tumbleweeds headcount or to undertake additional
restructurings of Tumbleweeds business. 

The restructuring of Tumbleweeds business has placed a strain on resources. 

The restructuring of Tumbleweeds business in 2001 has placed and continues to place, a significant strain on managerial,
informational, administrative and operational resources. Tumbleweeds current systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to achieve the rapid execution necessary to effectively operate within the market for its products and services.
Tumbleweed needs to continue to enhance and improve its managerial capacity, and improve or replace its existing operational, customer service and financial systems, procedures and controls. Any failure to properly manage these systems and
procedural transitions could impair Tumbleweeds ability to attract and service customers, and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of its business plan. Despite its restructuring, Tumbleweed expects that
it may need to expand elements of its employee base on a selective basis. Tumbleweeds management may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel. In addition, Tumbleweeds management may not be able to
successfully identify, manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities. If Tumbleweed cannot manage its operations effectively, Tumbleweeds business and operating results could suffer. Finally, Tumbleweed may have operational,
customer service and financial systems that are not appropriate for Tumbleweeds current estimated size. Moving to more appropriate office systems may also place a strain on Tumbleweeds current systems and require financial expenditures
to end the commitments on other systems. 

Tumbleweed has converted to a new financial system. 

In October 2002, Tumbleweed converted to a new financial system. As a result of this change, Tumbleweed may have difficulties retrieving historical financial information due to a lack of connectivity
between its previous financial system and its new financial system. Tumbleweeds new financial system is less complex than its previous financial system which may have a negative impact on its internal controls. 

Tumbleweed has a lengthy sales and implementation cycle
which could harm its business. 

If
Tumbleweed is unable to license its services to new customers on a timely basis or if its existing and proposed customers and their end-users suffer delays in the implementation and adoption of its services, Tumbleweeds revenue may be limited
and business and prospects may be harmed. Tumbleweeds customers must evaluate its technology and integrate its products and services into the products and services they provide. In addition, Tumbleweeds customers may need to adopt a
comprehensive sales, marketing and training program in order to effectively implement some of its products. Finally, Tumbleweed must coordinate with its customers using its product for third-party communications in order to assist end-users in the
adoption of Tumbleweeds products. For these and other reasons, the cycle associated with establishing licenses and implementing Tumbleweeds products can be lengthy. This cycle is also subject to a number of significant delays over which
Tumbleweed has little or no control. Forecasts about license revenue may be inaccurate as a result of any or all of these factors, and inaccurate forecasts may cause Tumbleweeds business, or market valuation, to suffer. 



A failure
to protect Tumbleweeds intellectual property may significantly harm its business. 

Tumbleweed currently relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and licenses, together with non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect its
proprietary rights in its products. Tumbleweed holds certain patent rights with respect to some of its products. Tumbleweed has filed, and expect in the future to file, additional patent applications. Tumbleweeds existing patents or
trademarks, as well as any future patents or trademarks obtained by Tumbleweed, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or Tumbleweeds competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to its technology. Further patent or trademark protection may not be obtained, in the United States or elsewhere, for Tumbleweeds existing or new products, applications or services. In addition, further protection, if obtained, may
not be effective. In some countries, meaningful patent or trademark protection is not available. 

Third parties could assert infringement claims against Tumbleweed in the future, and the cost of responding to such assertions, regardless of their validity, could be significant. Tumbleweed may
increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of its competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlap with Tumbleweeds. Tumbleweed aggressively seeks to enforce
its patent and other intellectual property rights. The enforcement process may be costly and require significant management attention. In addition, Tumbleweeds enforcement of its patent and other intellectual property rights may increase the
risk of adverse claims, with or without merit, which could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources, limit use of Tumbleweeds services or require Tumbleweed to enter into
royalty or license agreements. In addition, such claims may be found to be valid and could result in awards against Tumbleweed, which could harm Tumbleweeds business. 

Tumbleweed also relies, to some extent, on unpatented trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary
information. Tumbleweeds policy is to have employees sign confidentiality agreements, to have selected parties sign non-competition agreements and to have third parties sign non-disclosure agreements. Although Tumbleweed takes precautionary
measures to maintain its unpatented proprietary information, others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose Tumbleweeds proprietary information and Tumbleweed may be unable to meaningfully protect its rights
to its proprietary information. 

In September
2002, Tumbleweed received a letter from Entrust, Inc. indicating that Tumbleweed may be interested in licensing the technology covered by U.S. Patent No. 6,393,568, Encryption and Decryption System and Method with Content Analysis Provision, issued
to Entrust. In October 2002, Tumbleweed sent a letter to Entrust indicating that Entrust may be interested in licensing the technology covered by four patents issued to Tumbleweed, namely, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,061,448, Method & System For Dynamic
Server Document Encryption, 6,119,137, Distributed Dynamic Document Conversion Server, 6,151,675, Method & Apparatus For Effecting Secure Document Format Conversion, and 6,470,086, Method & Apparatus For Effecting Secure Document Format
Conversion. In February 2003, Tumbleweed received a letter from Entrust indicating that Tumbleweed may have an interest in three additional patents issued to Entrust: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,229,894, Method and Apparatus for Access to User-Specific
Encryption Information, 6,256,733, Access and Storage of Secure Group Communication Cryptographic Keys, and 6,266,420, Method and Apparatus for Secure Group Communication. 

Tumbleweed believes it does not infringe any valid Entrust patent. If Tumbleweed were to conclude based on
additional information that some element of its processes are or might be covered by any of these Entrust patents, Tumbleweed might seek to negotiate and obtain a license from Entrust. If Tumbleweed were unwilling or unable to obtain a license from
Entrust, Tumbleweed would remain subject to potential liability for patent infringement. Although Tumbleweed will contest any lawsuit by Entrust vigorously, Tumbleweed cannot make assurances that Tumbleweed will prevail if Entrust were to sue it for
infringement of any of these Entrust patents. If any portions of Tumbleweeds products were found to be infringing on these patents, then Tumbleweed would likely be unable to continue to offer those portions of its products found to be
infringing. Tumbleweed could also 



then be required to pay damages for past infringing use, possibly attorneys fees, and possibly treble damages. This could have a
material adverse effect on Tumbleweeds business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

If Tumbleweed does not provide adequate support services to its customers to implement its products, Tumbleweeds business may
suffer. 

Tumbleweeds professional
services organization assists its customers in implementing its products through software installation, integration with existing customer systems, contract engineering, consulting and training. If the professional services organization does not
adequately assess customer requirements or address technical problems, customers may seek to discontinue their relationships with us due to dissatisfaction with the product or Tumbleweeds customer support. Furthermore, these customers may
realize lower usage than they could have otherwise achieved because they did not fully capitalize on the product in ways that could have been addressed by Tumbleweeds professional services organization. Tumbleweeds products must be
integrated with existing hardware and complex software products of its customers or other third parties, and its customers may not have significant experience with the implementation of products similar to Tumbleweeds own. In addition,
profitably providing contract engineering and integration services is an increasingly important aspect of Tumbleweeds strategy to strengthen customer loyalty to its product and company. Therefore, Tumbleweeds business and future
prospects significantly depend on the strength of its professional services organization and its ability to leverage this organization by augmenting its reach through trained and qualified systems integrators. If Tumbleweeds professional
services organization does not adequately meet these multiple challenges, its business and prospects could suffer. 

Product performance problems, system failures, and Internet problems could severely damage Tumbleweeds business.

The ability of Tumbleweeds customers
to use its services depends on stable product performance, and the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the computer and communications hardware as well as the software and Internet network systems that they maintain. Although Tumbleweeds
ability to manage the effects of system failures which occur in computer hardware, software and network systems is limited, the occurrences of these failures could harm Tumbleweeds reputation, business and prospects. The Internet has
experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of Tumbleweeds infrastructure, and the Internet could face similar outages and delays in the future. In addition, an increasing number of Tumbleweeds
customers require us to provide computer and communications hardware, software and Internet networking systems to them as an outsourced data center service. All data centers, whether hosted by Tumbleweed, its customers or by an independent third
party to which it outsources this function, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure or other similar events. 

If Tumbleweeds software contains errors, Tumbleweed may lose customers or experience reduced market
acceptance of its products. 

Tumbleweeds software products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the products are in use. In addition, some of Tumbleweeds customers require or may require enhanced
customization of Tumbleweeds software for their specific needs, and these modifications may increase the likelihood of undetected defects or errors. Further, Tumbleweed often provides implementation, consulting and other technical services,
the performance of which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and networking systems, and Tumbleweed could fail to meet customer expectations as a result of any defects or errors. As a result, Tumbleweed may lose
customers, customers may fail to implement Tumbleweeds products more broadly within their organization and Tumbleweed may experience reduced market acceptance of Tumbleweeds products. Some of Tumbleweeds products are designed to
facilitate the secure transmission of sensitive business information to specified parties outside the business over the Internet. As a result, the reputation of Tumbleweeds software products for providing good security is vital to their
acceptance by 



customers. Tumbleweeds products may be vulnerable to break-ins, theft or other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of
information for which Tumbleweed is responsible. Problems caused by product defects, failure to meet project milestones for services or security breaches could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of market share, failure to achieve market
acceptance, diversion of research and development resources, harm to Tumbleweeds reputation, or increased insurance, service and warranty costs. To address these problems, Tumbleweed may need to expend significant capital resources that may
not have been budgeted. 

Failure to license
necessary third party software incorporated in Tumbleweeds products could cause delays or reductions in Tumbleweeds sales. 

Tumbleweed licenses third party software that Tumbleweed incorporates into its products. These licenses may not continue to be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some of this technology would be difficult to replace. The loss of any such license could result in delays or reductions of Tumbleweeds applications until Tumbleweed identifies, license and
integrate or develop equivalent software. If Tumbleweed is required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology, Tumbleweed could face higher royalty payments and Tumbleweeds products may lose certain
attributes or features. In the future, Tumbleweed might need to license other software to enhance its products and meet evolving customer needs. If Tumbleweed is unable to do this, Tumbleweed could experience reduced demand for its products.

Tumbleweed may be unable to recruit, retain
and motivate qualified personnel, which could harm Tumbleweeds business, including product development. 

Tumbleweed must continue to identify, recruit, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and
customer service personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and Tumbleweed may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, Tumbleweed may encounter difficulties in recruiting
a sufficient number of qualified software developers and sales personnel, and Tumbleweed may not be able to retain these employees. The failure to recruit and retain necessary technical, managerial, sales, merchandising, marketing and customer
service personnel could harm Tumbleweeds business and its ability to obtain new customers and develop new products. Although Tumbleweed has used and continue to use stock options as a retention tool, many of Tumbleweeds employees hold
stock options that are underwater (i.e., the market price of Tumbleweeds stock is below their option exercise price), and these options may be ineffective as a retention tool. Tumbleweeds employee turnover may increase if
outstanding stock options continue to remain underwater and Tumbleweed does not adjust the option exercise prices. Any adjustment of stock option exercise prices may result in additional stock compensation expense, dilution to Tumbleweeds
stockholders and depress Tumbleweeds stock price. 

If Tumbleweed loses the services of executive officers or other key employees, Tumbleweeds ability to develop its business and secure customer relationships will suffer. 

Tumbleweed is substantially dependent on the continued
services and performance of its executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of Tumbleweeds executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of Tumbleweeds
development and strategic objectives. Tumbleweed does not have long-term employment agreements with any of Tumbleweeds key personnel. The loss of services of any of Tumbleweeds executive officers or other key personnel could
significantly harm Tumbleweeds business and prospects. 

Tumbleweeds efforts to establish, maintain and strengthen its brands will require significant expenditures and may not be successful. 

If the marketplace does not associate Tumbleweeds brands with high quality Internet communication
services, it may be more difficult for us to attract new customers or introduce future products and services. The market for Tumbleweeds services is new. Therefore, Tumbleweeds failure to establish brand recognition at this 



stage could harm its ability to compete in the future with other companies that successfully establish a brand name for their services.
Tumbleweed must succeed in its marketing efforts, provide high quality services and increase Tumbleweeds user base in order to build its brand awareness and differentiate Tumbleweeds products from those of its competitors. These efforts
have required significant expenditures to date. Moreover, Tumbleweed believes that these efforts will require substantial commitments of resources in the future as Tumbleweeds brands become increasingly important to its overall strategy and as
the market for Tumbleweeds services grows. 

Tumbleweeds allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover receivables Tumbleweed is unable to collect. 

Tumbleweed assumes a certain level of credit risk with its customers in order to do business. Conditions affecting any of
Tumbleweeds customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for products or services Tumbleweed has already provided them. For example, if the current economic conditions continue to decline or
if new or unanticipated government regulations are enacted which affect Tumbleweeds customers, they may be unable to pay their bills. In the past, Tumbleweed has experienced significant collection delays from certain customers, and Tumbleweed
cannot predict whether it will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future. In particular, some of Tumbleweeds customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in
particular. Although Tumbleweed has established an allowance for doubtful accounts that it believes is sufficient to cover losses due to delays in or inability to pay and while it takes a consistently conservative position on the collectibility of
receivables with respect to particular customers, Tumbleweeds allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover its losses. If losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than Tumbleweeds allowance for doubtful
accounts, Tumbleweed would be required to recognize an additional expense for the write-off and to increase Tumbleweeds allowance for doubtful accounts , which could adversely affect its operating results. 

Because Tumbleweeds products utilize the Internet, if
use of the Internet does not increase, or the architecture of the Internet is altered, the level of use of Tumbleweeds products will suffer. 

If the Internet and other products and services necessary for the utilization of Tumbleweeds products are not sufficiently
developed, fewer customers and end-users will use Tumbleweeds products and its business will be harmed. In particular, the success of Tumbleweeds products and services will depend on the development and maintenance of adequate Internet
infrastructure, such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and other features demanded by users. Moreover, Tumbleweeds success will also depend on the timely development of complementary products or services
such as high-speed Internet connections for providing reliable access and services and this may not occur. Moreover, changes in the architecture of the Internet may limit the success of Tumbleweeds products. Because the online exchange of
information is new and evolving, the Internet may not prove to be a viable platform for secure messaging applications in the long term. The Internet has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of
users and amount of traffic. As the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users and frequency of use, or if its users require increasingly more resources, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on
it. As a result, the performance or reliability of the Internet may be harmed. This in turn could decrease the level of Internet usage and also the level of utilization of Tumbleweeds products and services. 

Government regulation relating to the Internet may increase
costs of doing business or require changes in Tumbleweeds business model. 

Tumbleweed is subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to companies utilizing the Internet. Although at present there are relatively few
specific laws and regulations directly applicable to the Internet, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws could cover issues like user privacy, pricing, content, intellectual



property, distribution, taxation, antitrust, legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and services. The adoption of any
additional laws or regulations could decrease the demand for Tumbleweeds products and services and increase Tumbleweeds cost of doing business or otherwise harm Tumbleweeds business or prospects. Delays in the enactment of expected
regulations may result in delayed software purchasing by Tumbleweeds customers who are subject to such regulations, which in turn may harm Tumbleweeds business. 

Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like
property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online
commerce. New state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to Tumbleweeds
business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could harm Tumbleweeds ability to conduct business and harm operating results. 

Tumbleweeds products are subject to export controls,
and Tumbleweed may be unable to obtain necessary export approvals. 

Exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the U.S. and various foreign governments. All cryptographic products require export licenses from certain U.S. government agencies. We
have obtained approval to export products using up to 128-bit symmetric encryption and 1024-bit public key encryption, including the products formerly named IME Server, IME Desktop, IME Receive Applet, IME Remote API using OmniORB with SSL, MMS
WorldWide/56 and MMS Strong WorldWide/128. We are not exporting other products and services that are subject to export control under U.S. law. However, the list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the related
regulatory policies, could be revised, and Tumbleweed may not be able to obtain necessary approval for the export of future products. The inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could limit Tumbleweeds ability to make
international sales. Furthermore, competitors may also seek to obtain approvals to export products that could increase the amount of competition Tumbleweed faces. Additionally, countries outside of the U.S. could impose regulatory restrictions
impairing Tumbleweeds ability to import its products into those countries. 

Costs of communicating via the Internet could increase if access fees are imposed. 

Certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the Internet has burdened the existing
telecommunications infrastructure, and that many areas with high Internet use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service. These carriers have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to impose access fees on Internet service
providers and online service providers. If these access fees are imposed, the costs of communicating on the Internet could increase substantially, potentially slowing the increasing use of the Internet. This could in turn decrease demand for
Tumbleweeds services or increase the costs of doing business. 

Tumbleweed may have liability for Internet content. 

As a provider of Internet communication products and services, Tumbleweed faces potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the
nature and content of the materials transmitted online. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could be costly and could require us to implement measures to reduce
exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue selected service or product offerings. 

We do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by users of Tumbleweeds product but may be exposed to liability with
respect to this content. Furthermore, certain foreign governments, such as Germany, 



have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the Internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the
U.S. Other countries, such as China, regulate or prohibit the transport of telephonic data in their territories. Failure to comply with regulations in a particular jurisdiction could result in fines or criminal penalties or the termination of
service in one or more jurisdictions. Moreover, the increased attention focused on liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet use. Liability insurance may not cover claims of these types,
or may not be adequate to indemnify against all liability that may be imposed. 

Tumbleweed is a defendant in purported securities lawsuits. 

On July 7, 2000, three complaints were filed by David H. Zimmer, Congressional Securities, Inc. and other plaintiffs against Interface
Systems, Inc. (a company Tumbleweed acquired in 2000) and various additional defendants, including Interfaces prior president and chief executive officer, Robert A. Nero, and Fiserv Correspondent Services, Inc., in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The three complaints contained substantially similar allegations of false and misleading representations by various defendants allegedly designed to inflate Interfaces stock price. The complaints
sought relief under the federal securities laws on behalf of purported classes of persons who purchased, held, or sold shares of Interface stock, and under various other causes of action. On July 27, 2001, the Court granted Tumbleweeds motion
to transfer the lawsuits to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, which, on April 19, 2002, dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs class allegations and federal securities law claims that purportedly arose under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Also on April 19, 2002, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Consolidated Complaint that (i) consolidated the separate actions into one action, (ii) added certain new plaintiffs, (iii) withdrew
Congressional Securities, Inc. as a plaintiff, and (iv) added claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation, which are the sole remaining claims in the case. On May 20, 2002, Tumbleweed filed a motion to dismiss these claims,
which motion has remained pending before the Court while the case has continued to proceed through the discovery phase. The accompanying financial statements do not include a reserve for any costs for damages, if any, that might result from this
uncertainty. Tumbleweed believes this consolidated action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it and seek its dismissal. 

An attorney issued a press release on March 7, 2003 stating that he had filed a purported securities class action lawsuit, alleging the
violation of federal and state securities laws, on behalf of persons who acquired the common stock of Tumbleweed (other than purchasers of Tumbleweeds initial public offering) during the time period from August 6, 1999 and October 18, 2000,
inclusive. According to the press release, the lead plaintiff in this purported class action lawsuit is a person whose deceased husband purchased approximately 2,700 shares of securities of Commerce One, Inc. In addition, the press release states
that this purported class action lawsuit names Tumbleweed Communications Corp. as a defendant, along with Jeffrey C. Smith and Joseph C. Consul (who served as Tumbleweeds Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively,
during that time period). Tumbleweed has not been served with a summons or a complaint with respect to this purported securities class action lawsuit. 

Although Tumbleweed believes these lawsuits are without merit, no assurance can be given about their outcome, and an adverse outcome could
significantly harm Tumbleweeds business and operating results. Moreover, the costs in defending the lawsuits could harm future operating results. 

Internet and technology related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress Tumbleweeds stock price.

The stock market has experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies, particularly Internet-related companies, have been highly volatile. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. The institution of this type of litigation against Tumbleweed could 



result in substantial costs and a diversion of Tumbleweeds managements attention and resources, which could harm
Tumbleweeds business and prospects. 

Tumbleweeds certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage or prevent an acquisition of Tumbleweed, which could depress Tumbleweeds stock price. 

Tumbleweeds certificate of incorporation and bylaws may
inhibit changes of control that are not approved by its Board of Directors. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Tumbleweeds common stock. In particular, Tumbleweeds
certificate of incorporation provides for a classified Board of Directors and prohibits stockholder action by written consent. These provisions require advance notice for nomination of directors and stockholders proposals. In addition, as a
Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, this law prevents a person who becomes the owner of 15% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock from engaging in specified
business combinations for three years unless specified conditions are satisfied. In addition, Tumbleweeds certificate of incorporation allows its Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. This could have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. The issuance of preferred stock also could effectively limit the voting power of the holders of Tumbleweed common stock. The provisions of Tumbleweeds certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may discourage or prevent an acquisition or disposition of Tumbleweeds business. 

Tumbleweed may not be able to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq National Market, and if Tumbleweed fails to do so, the price and
liquidity of Tumbleweeds common stock may decline. 

The Nasdaq Stock Market has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the Nasdaq National Market. The requirements include maintaining a minimum bid price per share of $1. As of March 12, 2003,
Tumbleweed was in compliance with all Nasdaq National Market listing requirements. However, there have been recent periods when the closing bid price per share for Tumbleweeds common stock has dropped below $1. Although Tumbleweeds bid
price has generally been above $1 per share, if the bid price of Tumbleweeds common stock price slips below $1 per share for more than 30 trading days, Tumbleweed may be required to effect a reverse stock split or become subject to a delisting
action of Tumbleweeds common stock on The Nasdaq National Market. Tumbleweed may nonetheless be unable to comply with the quantitative maintenance criteria or any of The Nasdaq National Markets listing requirements and other rules in the
future. If Tumbleweed fails to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq National Market and must move to a market with less liquidity, Tumbleweeds financial condition could be harmed and its stock price may decline. If Tumbleweed were to be
delisted, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of, and the liquidity of the trading market for, Tumbleweeds common stock. 

Risks Related to Valicert 

Valicert may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Valicerts outside accountants have included a paragraph in their report indicating that substantial doubt exists as to Valicerts ability to continue as a going concern. Valicert incurred
net losses of $28.3 million in 2000, $28.4 million in 2001 and $21.7 million in 2002. Valicert must increase its revenues by obtaining new customers and generating additional revenues from existing customers and by controlling its costs. Valicert
may not have any revenue growth, its revenues could decline, and it may incur losses for the foreseeable future. If Valicert is unable to increase revenues, it cannot be certain that it can reach profitability or positive cash flows in the future.
If Valicert is unable to achieve positive cash flows, and if the proposed merger with Tumbleweed is not completed, it will require additional financing. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If Valicert is unable
to raise additional capital when needed, it may be unable to continue as a viable company. In the event that the merger with Tumbleweed is not completed and an appropriate financing or an alternative transaction is not implemented promptly following
termination of the merger agreement, Valicert may be required to commence bankruptcy or similar liquidation proceedings with little if any value to be realized by the Valicert common stockholders. 



In
September 2002, Valicert transferred its securities from The Nasdaq National Market to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, which may affect the liquidity of its stock. 

In June 2002, the staff of The Nasdaq National Market advised Valicert that it would delist Valicert stock on
September 9, 2002 because it failed to meet certain listing qualifications of The Nasdaq National Market, unless Valicert applied to transfer its securities to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market or requested a hearing to appeal the staffs
determination. Valicert transferred its securities to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market on the opening of the market on September 9, 2002. The transfer from The Nasdaq National Market to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market may be a less desirable and a less liquid
marketplace. 

If Valicerts common stock
price remains under $1.00, or if it otherwise fails to comply with Nasdaq rules, Valicerts common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, which could eliminate the trading market for its common stock. 

If the market price for Valicerts common stock remains
below $1.00 per share through June 6, 2003 or Valicert otherwise fails to meet certain criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Small Cap Market, Valicert has been notified by Nasdaq that its common stock may be delisted. Should Valicerts
common stock be delisted from The Nasdaq Small Cap Market, its common stock would trade on the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Market. If Valicerts common stock is traded on the OTC, you likely would find it more difficult to trade in or obtain
accurate quotations for the market price of Valicerts common stock. 

If Valicerts common stock is considered penny stock under Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices in broker-dealers who sell
Valicerts securities. For example, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Also, a disclosure schedule must be
prepared prior to any transaction involving a penny stock and disclosure is required about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Monthly statements are also
required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock. Because of these additional obligations, some brokers may be unwilling to effect transactions in
penny stocks. This could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of Valicerts common stock and the ability of investors to sell the common stock. 

The market price per share of Valicerts common stock following a reverse split may drop and may not remain in excess of the $1.00
minimum bid price as required by Nasdaq, as downward pressure may be created by such split or other factors may arise. 

As a means to conform to the Nasdaq minimum price rule, Valicert may request its stockholders to approve a reverse stock split for the
purpose of increasing its stock price above $1.00 per share. Valicert cannot predict whether a reverse stock split, if completed, will increase the market price for its common stock. The history of similar stock split combinations for companies in
like circumstances is varied. The market price per share of Valicerts common stock following the reverse stock split may not remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price as required by Nasdaq or that Valicert will otherwise meet the
requirements of Nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading on The Nasdaq Small Cap Market. A reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of Valicerts common stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as its
relative value becomes greater following the reverse split. In other words, the stock, at its new higher price, has farther to fall and therefore more room for investors to short or otherwise trade the value of the stock downward. Similarly, a
delisting may negatively impact the value of the stock as stocks trading on the OTC market are typically less liquid and trade with larger variations between bid and ask price. The market price of Valicerts common stock will also be based on
its performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. If a reverse split is affected and the market price of Valicerts common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a
percentage of Valicerts overall market capitalization may be 



greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Furthermore, the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after
the reverse stock split could adversely affect liquidity of Valicerts common stock. Moreover, the ability of Valicert to repurchase fractional shares in connection with a reverse split may be limited or prohibited by applicable state law
regarding the redemption or repurchase of securities for cash. In any event, effecting such a split will entail substantial cost to comply with applicable federal and state securities laws, particularly in those states where a permit of special
qualification is required. Valicert may lack the cash resources to satisfy these costs and therefore effect compliance. 

The costs of operating Valicert as an independent public company may not be justified in light of its historical and projected
operating results. 

The costs of operating a
small capitalization public company are considerable and have increased for Valicert as a result of compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, regulatory costs arising from the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, compliance with the
various blue sky and other state laws applicable to small capitalization companies, and otherwise. These increased costs may place a significant and increasing burden on Valicert and divert managements attention from operating Valicerts
business to raising capital and complying with application regulation. Moreover, like many other small capitalization companies, the ability of Valicert to attract and retain employees with equity compensation has diminished, which may necessitate
the need to pay additional cash compensation to employees, management and directors to motivate and retain them. In the event that the merger with Tumbleweed is not completed, Valicert may be unable to operate efficiently as an independent public
company in light of these additional costs or otherwise, and the inability to do so would materially and adversely affect Valicerts prospects and ability to continue as an independent going concern. 

Valicerts recently announced merger with Tumbleweed
may subject Valicerts stock price to downward adjustments as a result of adverse developments in Tumbleweeds business. 

Valicert announced on February 18, 2003 that it had entered into a merger agreement with Tumbleweed, pursuant to which Valicerts
stockholders will receive 0.385 shares of Tumbleweed common stock for each outstanding share of Valicert common stock that they hold. Since Valicert may terminate the agreement only in very limited circumstances and the exchange ratio is not subject
to adjustment, Valicerts stock price may be affected by changes in Tumbleweeds stock price. Accordingly, Valicerts stockholders are subject to the risk of downward adjustments in Valicerts stock price as a result of adverse
developments in Tumbleweeds business. Moreover, if for any reason Valicert is unable to complete the merger with Tumbleweed, the price of Valicerts common stock may be adversely affected. 

Valicerts efforts to close the proposed merger with
Tumbleweed may harm Valicerts business as a result of delays in executing Valicerts separate business strategy and uncertainties caused by the proposed merger. 

Valicerts efforts to complete the proposed merger with Tumbleweed are complex and time consuming, and
may disrupt Valicerts business. The attention and effort devoted to the proposed merger may significantly divert managements attention from Valicerts other important business objectives. 

Completion of the proposed merger is not certain, and this
uncertainty may harm Valicerts business by disrupting relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other strategic relationships. 

As a result of these uncertainties and the efforts related to the proposed merger with Tumbleweed, Valicerts business could be
harmed as a result as a result of: 



the inability to obtain alternative funding sources during the pendancy of the merger for purposes of ensuring liquidity and viability as an independent going
concern; 



potential loss of key management, development or other personnel; 





decline in employee morale; 



difficulties in hiring qualified development and other personnel to fill open positions; 



cancellations, reductions or delays in orders for Valicerts products or services; 



the reluctance of new or old customers and vendors to enter into or expand relationships or agreements with Valicert; and 



an inability to pursue or complete acquisitions of other companies that may be strategic to Valicerts business. 

If Valicert is unable to complete the proposed merger with
Tumbleweed, Valicerts business will be harmed. 

The proposed merger is subject to approval by Valicerts stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The proposed merger may not be successfully completed. If so, Valicerts business may be harmed as a result of:



legal, accounting and other costs that Valicert has incurred in conjunction with the proposed merger; 



a potential loss of key management, development or other personnel; 



a decline in employee morale; 



damage to customer relationships, including cancellations, reductions or delays in orders for Valicerts products or services; 



a loss of key strategic relationships or key business partners; and 



delays in product development or development of new service capabilities. 

Pursuant to terms of the merger agreement, Valicert has not pursued other corporate opportunities, including
raising additional funds and continuing Valicerts operations as a standalone company. As a result, if Valicert does not consummate the merger with Tumbleweed, Valicerts financial condition may be inadequate for Valicert to continue to
operate Valicerts business. In addition, Valicerts inability to complete the merger with Tumbleweed may lower Valicerts value or reduce Valicerts ability to merge with other companies that may have been interested in
acquiring Valicert. In addition, Valicert could be required to pay a termination fee to Tumbleweed upon the occurrence of certain events. 

If the merger with Tumbleweed is not consummated, Valicert will have to raise additional capital or Valicert may not be able to develop
or enhance its products, services and markets. 

If the merger with Tumbleweed is not consummated, Valicert will have to seek additional funding. If Valicert cannot quickly raise funds on acceptable terms, Valicert may be unable to develop or enhance Valicerts products and
services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Valicert may also be required to reduce operating costs through lay-offs or reduce Valicerts sales and marketing or research
and development efforts. If Valicert issues equity securities to raise funds, stockholders may experience significant dilution and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of Valicerts common stock.

Because Valicert has a limited operating
history, it is difficult to evaluate Valicerts prospects. 

Valicert introduced its first commercial product in the first quarter of 1999 and has generated only limited revenues. Because Valicert has a limited operating history with Valicerts products and services, and because
Valicerts sources of potential revenue may continue to shift as Valicerts business develops, Valicerts future operating results and Valicerts future stock prices are difficult to predict. Valicerts success also depends
in part on: 



the rate and timing of the growth and use of the Internet for electronic commerce and communications; 





the acceptance of existing security measures as adequate for electronic commerce and communications over the Internet; 



the rate and timing of the growth and use of specific technologies such as public key infrastructure and electronic payments and other Internet security
technologies; 



Valicerts ability to maintain Valicerts current, and enter into additional, strategic relationships; and 



Valicerts ability to effectively manage Valicerts growth and to attract and retain skilled professionals. 

If any of these risks develop, Valicerts business could
be seriously harmed. 

Valicerts
quarterly results depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond Valicerts control. 

Valicerts quarterly results depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond Valicerts control. Valicerts
quarterly results have in the past fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of many factors, including the following: 



the size, timing, cancellation or delay of customer orders; 



the timing of releases of Valicerts new software products; 



the number of transactions conducted using Valicerts products and services; 



the long sales cycles for, and complexity of, Valicerts software products and services; 



the timing and execution of large individual contracts; 



the impact of changes in the pricing models for Valicerts software products and services or Valicerts competitors products and services; and



the continued development of Valicerts direct and indirect distribution channels. 

Valicert believes that period-to-period comparisons of Valicerts results of operations are not
meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Valicerts failure to meet these expectations would likely cause the market price of Valicerts common stock to decline. 

Valicert has not been profitable, and if Valicert does not
achieve profitability, Valicerts business may fail. 

Valicert has incurred significant net losses. Valicert incurred net losses of $21.7 million in 2002 and $28.4 million in 2001. As of December 31, 2002, Valicert had incurred cumulative losses of $96.3 million. Widespread
acceptance of electronic commerce may be adversely affected as a result of general or industry specific economic conditions. As a consequence, the market for Valicerts products and services may fail to develop and grow and Valicert may be
unable to achieve Valicerts financial targets. 

Valicert will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability. Even if Valicert does achieve profitability, Valicert may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis
in the future. If Valicerts gross margins do not improve, or if Valicerts operating expenses exceed Valicerts expectations, Valicerts operating results will suffer and Valicerts stock price may fall. 

If Valicert does not successfully develop new products and
services to respond to rapid market changes due to changing technology and evolving industry standards, Valicerts business will be harmed. 

Valicerts success will depend to a substantial degree on Valicerts ability to offer products and services that incorporate
leading technology and to respond to technological advances. If Valicert fails to offer products and services that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances and emerging standards, Valicert may not generate sufficient
revenues to offset Valicerts development costs and other expenses, which 



will hurt Valicerts business. The development of new or enhanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process that requires
the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. Valicert may experience development, marketing and other technological difficulties that may delay or limit Valicerts ability to respond to technological changes, evolving industry
standards, competitive developments or customer requirements. You should also be aware that: 



Valicerts technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies; 



Valicert may incur substantial costs if Valicert needs to modify Valicerts products and services to respond to these alternative technologies;



Valicert may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or to introduce new products or services capable of competing with future
technologies; 



Valicert may be unable to acquire the rights to use the intellectual property necessary to implement new technology; and 



when introducing new or enhanced products or services, Valicert may be unable to manage effectively the transition from older products and services.

Valicert relies on, and expects
to continue to rely on, a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of its revenues, and if any of these or other significant customer stops licensing Valicerts software products and services, Valicerts revenues could
decline. 

A limited number of customers have
accounted for a significant portion of Valicerts revenues. For 2002, one customer accounted for 12% of total revenues. For 2001, two customers accounted for 20% and 14% of total revenues. Valicert anticipates that Valicerts operating
results in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers. Valicert does not have long-term contracts with Valicerts customers that obligate them to license Valicerts
software products or use Valicerts services. Valicert cannot be certain that Valicert will retain Valicerts customers or that Valicert will be able to obtain new customers. If Valicert were to lose one or more customers, Valicerts
revenues could decline. 

The length of
Valicerts sales cycle is uncertain, which may cause Valicerts revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and could cause Valicerts stock price to decline. 

Any failure of Valicerts sales efforts to generate
revenues at the times and in the amounts Valicert anticipates could cause significant variations in Valicerts operating results. During Valicerts sales cycle, Valicert spends considerable time and expense providing information to
prospective customers about the use and benefits of Valicerts products and services without generating corresponding revenue. Valicerts expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and there is substantial uncertainty as to when
particular sales efforts will begin to generate revenues. 

Prospective customers of Valicerts products and services often require long testing and approval processes before making a purchase decision. In general, the process of entering into a licensing arrangement with a potential
customer may involve lengthy negotiations. As a result, Valicerts sales cycle has been and may continue to be unpredictable. In the past, Valicerts sales cycle has ranged from one to nine or more months. Valicerts sales cycle is
also subject to delays as a result of customer-specific factors over which Valicert has little or no control, including budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures. In addition, because Valicerts technology must often be
integrated with the products and services of other vendors, there may be a significant delay between the use of Valicerts software and services in a pilot system and its commercial deployment by Valicerts customers. The length of the
sales cycle makes it difficult to accurately forecast the timing and amount of Valicerts sales. This may cause Valicerts revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could harm Valicerts
business. 



Valicerts international business exposes Valicert to additional risks. 

Products and services provided to Valicerts international customers accounted for 51% of Valicerts revenues during 2002 and
61% of Valicerts revenues during 2001. Conducting business outside of the United States subjects Valicert to additional risks, including: 



changes in regulatory requirements; 



reduced protection of intellectual property rights; 



evolving privacy laws; 



tariffs and other trade barriers; 



difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 



problems in collecting accounts receivable; and 



difficulties in authenticating customer information. 

Valicert must maintain and enter into new collaborative agreements, and any failure to do so could harm Valicerts business.

One of Valicerts objectives is to
enter into strategic or other similar collaborative alliances in order to reach a larger customer base than Valicert could reach through Valicerts direct sales and marketing efforts. Valicert will need to maintain or enter into additional
strategic alliances to execute Valicerts business plan. If Valicert is unable to maintain Valicerts strategic alliances or enter into additional strategic alliances, Valicerts business would be materially harmed. 

Valicert has entered into technology, marketing and
distribution agreements with several companies. Valicert may be unable to leverage the brand and distribution power of these agreements to increase the adoption rate of Valicerts technology. Valicert has been establishing agreements to ensure
that third-party solutions are interoperable with Valicerts software products and services. To the extent that Valicerts products are not interoperable or Valicerts agreements choose not to integrate Valicerts technology into
their offerings, the adoption of Valicerts software products and outsourced services would be inhibited. Furthermore, agreements Valicerts success will depend in part on the ultimate success of other parties to these agreements.

Valicerts existing agreements do not, and
any future agreements may not, grant Valicert exclusive marketing or distribution rights. In addition, the other parties may not view their agreements with Valicert as significant for their own businesses. Therefore, these parties could reduce their
commitment to Valicert at any time in the future. These parties could also pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products and services, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including Valicerts competitors.
Should any of these developments occur, Valicerts business will be harmed. 

Valicerts success depends on its ability to grow and develop its direct sales and indirect distribution channels. 

Valicerts failure to grow and develop Valicerts direct sales channel and increase the number of
Valicerts indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on Valicerts business, operating results and financial condition. Valicert must increase the number of strategic and other third-party relationships with
vendors of Internet-related systems and application software, resellers and systems integrators. Valicerts existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies.



Valicert
has made recent changes to its management team and board of directors. The result of these changes is uncertain and may not be effective. 

John Vigouroux, Valicerts former president of field operations, was named president and chief executive officer and appointed to the
board of directors in October 2002. Joseph (Yosi) Amram resigned as Valicerts president and chief executive officer in October 2002. Mr. Amram continues to act as Valicerts advisor and remains on Valicerts board of
directors. Mr. Vigouroux has not previously served as President or Chief Executive Officer of an independent public company. If Mr. Vigouroux does not effectively integrate into his new leadership role or if he does not work effectively with
Valicerts existing management team, Valicerts business may suffer. 

Valicert may be unable to retain qualified personnel, which could harm Valicerts business and product development. 

Valicert also must continue to train, retain, and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and
marketing and professional services personnel. Due to the various workforce reductions that Valicert completed, the morale of Valicerts remaining employees is low, and Valicert may be unable to retain them, particularly in light of
Valicerts limited cash resources. In addition, if Valicerts stock price decreases substantially, it may be more difficult to retain employees who consider stock options an important part of their compensation package. If Valicert
encounters difficulties retaining software engineering personnel at a critical stage of product development, Valicerts relationship with existing and future customers could be harmed. The failure to retain necessary technical, managerial,
sales, marketing and professional services personnel would harm Valicerts business. 

Valicerts business will suffer if Valicert is unable to protect its intellectual property. 

Valicert relies on copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, patents, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to
maintain and further develop Valicerts market position. In addition, Valicert relies on outside licensors for patent and software license rights in encryption technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of
Valicerts products and services. Valicerts success will depend in part on Valicerts continued ability to have access to technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of Valicerts products and services.
The inability to continue to procure or use this technology could harm Valicerts business. 

Valicerts success will also depend in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights from infringement, misappropriation, duplication and discovery by third parties. Others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology or gain access to Valicerts trade secrets or disclose Valicerts technology and that Valicert may be unable to meaningfully protect Valicerts trade secrets.
Attempts by others to utilize Valicerts intellectual property rights could undermine Valicerts ability to retain or secure customers. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent,
as do the laws of the United States. Valicerts attempts to enforce Valicerts intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly. 

Valicerts pending or future patent applications may not be granted and any patents that are issued may not be enforceable or valid.
Additionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Valicert may not be the first inventor of inventions covered by Valicerts issued patent or pending patent applications or that
Valicert is the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Moreover, Valicert may have to participate in interference proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result
in substantial cost to Valicert. An adverse outcome could subject Valicert to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require Valicert to cease using the technology in dispute.



Any claim
of infringement by third parties could be costly to defend, and if Valicert infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, Valicert may be required to pay substantial licensing fees. 

Valicert may increasingly become subject to claims of
intellectual property infringement by third parties as the number of Valicerts competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlaps with ours. Because Valicert is in an evolving field, customers may
demand features which will subject Valicert to a greater likelihood of claims of infringement. 

Valicert is aware of pending and issued United States and foreign patent rights owned by third parties that relate to cryptography technology. Third parties may assert that Valicert infringed their
intellectual property rights based upon issued patents, trade secrets or know-how that they believe cover Valicerts technology. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties which Valicert may infringe. It may be time consuming and
costly to defend Valicert against any of these claims and Valicert may not prevail. 

Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block Valicerts ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of
Valicerts products in the United States and abroad. In the event of a claim of infringement, Valicert may be required to obtain one or more licenses from or pay royalties to third parties. Valicert may be unable to obtain any such licenses at
a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain such license could harm Valicerts business. 

Defects in Valicerts software products and services could diminish demand for Valicerts products and services, which may
harm Valicerts business. 

Because
Valicerts products and services are complex, they may contain errors or defects that are not found until after they are used by Valicerts customers. Errors or defects that subsequently arise could seriously harm Valicerts
reputation and Valicerts ability to generate sales to new or existing customers. 

Valicerts software products and services are used in systems with other vendors products. These products and services can be adequately tested only when they are successfully integrated
with these systems. Errors may be found in new products or releases after shipment and Valicerts products and services may not operate as expected. Errors or defects in Valicerts products and services could result in: 



loss of revenues and increased service and warranty costs; 



delay in market acceptance; 



loss of salaries; and 



injury to Valicerts reputation. 

Failure to increase Valicerts brand awareness could limit Valicerts ability to compete effectively. 

If the marketplace does not associate Valicert with
high-quality, end-to-end secure infrastructure software products and services, Valicert may be unable to keep Valicerts existing customers, attract new customers or successfully introduce new products and services. Competitive and other
pressures may require Valicert to increase Valicerts expenses to promote Valicerts brand name, and the benefits associated with brand creation may not outweigh the risks and costs associated with establishing Valicerts brand name.
Valicerts failure to develop a strong brand name or the incurrence of excessive costs associated with establishing Valicerts brand name may harm Valicerts business. 

Valicert relies on public key cryptography and other security techniques that could be breached, resulting
in reduced demand for Valicerts products and services. 

A requirement for the continued growth of electronic commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Valicert relies on public key cryptography, an encryption method that utilizes



two keys, a public and private key, for encoding and decoding data, and on digital certificate technology, to provide the security and
authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information. Regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit Valicert from using the strongest and most secure cryptographic protection available, and thereby may expose Valicert or
Valicerts customers to a risk of data interception. A party who is able to circumvent Valicerts security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt Valicerts or Valicerts customers operations.
Any compromise or elimination of Valicerts security could result in risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and reduce demand for Valicerts products and services. 

Valicert could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating Valicerts
customers use of Valicerts products and services. 

Any disruption to a customers website or application caused by Valicerts products or services could result in a claim for substantial damages against Valicert, regardless of Valicerts responsibility for the
failure. Valicerts existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims. Valicerts insurer may also disclaim coverage as to any claims, which could
result in substantial costs to Valicert. 

Valicert granted options for approximately 1.1 million shares of Valicerts common stock that may have violated California securities laws. 

On December 12, 2002, Valicert granted options to purchase a total of 1,029,209 shares of Valicerts
common stock at an exercise price of $0.28 per share, which was the fair market value on the date of grant. Such grants were not properly qualified under the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. Valicert is in the process of
submitting an application for a permit from the California Department of Corporations in order to effectuate a rescission offer and minimize any liability Valicert may have. If the rescission offer is effected, Valicert estimates that the liability
would not be material. If the rescission offer is not effected, optionees may have a claim for the fair value of their option at the time of the grant, which the Department of Corporations historically has set at 20% of the exercise price, or, if an
optionee were to exercise the option and thereafter seek rescission, the liability would be a refund of the exercise price paid plus interest from the date of exercise until rescission. 

Valicert has been named as a defendant in a stockholder class action lawsuit that is now pending and which
arose out of Valicerts public offering of securities in 2000. If Valicert does not prevail in this lawsuit, Valicerts business may suffer. 

A class action lawsuit was filed on December 3, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf
of purchasers of Valicert common stock alleging violations of federal securities laws. Lachance v. Valicert, Inc. et al., No. 01-CV-10889 (SAS) (S.D.N.Y.), related to In re Initial Public Offerings Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92 (SAS). The case
is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased Valicerts common stock from July 27, 2000 through December 6, 2000. The complaint names as defendants the Company; Joseph (Yosi) Amram, former President, Chief Executive
Officer, and member of the Board of Directors; Timothy Conley, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and an investment banking firm that served as an underwriter for Valicerts initial public offering in July 2000. 

The amended complaint alleges violations of Sections 11 and 15
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act on the grounds that the prospectus incorporated in the registration statement for the offering failed to disclose, among other things, the following:



the underwriter had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriter allocated to those
investors material portions of the shares of Valicerts stock sold in the initial public offering, and 





the underwriter had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriter agreed to allocate shares of Valicerts stock sold in the initial public
offering to those customers in exchange for which the customers agreed to purchase additional shares of Valicerts stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued. No
specific damages are claimed. 

Valicert believes that the allegations against it are without merit and Valicert intends to contest them vigorously. Valicert cannot assure you, however, that Valicert will prevail in this lawsuit. Failure to prevail could have a
material adverse effect on Valicerts financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future. 

Valicert is aware that similar allegations have been made in other lawsuits filed in the Southern District of New York challenging over
300 other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in 1999 and 2000. Those cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before the Honorable Judge Shira A. Scheindlin. On July 15, 2002, Valicert and Valicerts
affiliated individual defendants (as well as all other issuer defendants) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The Court denied the motions to dismiss claims under the Securities Act in all but 10 of the cases, including Valicerts case.
The Court granted the motion to dismiss the claims under the Exchange Act against Valicert and the individual defendants. Management believes that the allegations against Valicert and Valicerts officers are without merit and intends to contest
them vigorously. If the outcome of the litigation is adverse to Valicert and if, in addition, Valicert were required to pay significant monetary damages in excess of available insurance, Valicerts business would be significantly harmed.

In addition, Valicert may become subject to
other types of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources, which could harm Valicerts business. 

Additional government regulation relating to the Internet may increase Valicerts costs of doing
business. 

Valicert is subject to
regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to companies utilizing the Internet. Although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the Internet, it is possible that a number
of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws could cover issues like user privacy, pricing, content, intellectual property, distribution, antitrust, legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and
services. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations could decrease the demand for Valicerts products and services and increase Valicerts cost of doing business, or otherwise could harm Valicerts business or prospects.

Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of
existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. For example, tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment
of companies engaged in online commerce. New state tax regulations may subject Valicert to additional state sales and income taxes. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not
currently apply to Valicerts business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could harm Valicerts ability to conduct business and Valicerts operating results.

Valicert may be required to record impairment
charges related to its goodwill in future quarters. 

At December 31, 2002, Valicert had recorded goodwill with a net book value of $7.5 million related to Valicerts 1999 acquisition of Receipt.com. Valicert tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and when evidence of an
impairment exists. Valicert has not recorded any impairment charges through December 31, 2002. However, if Valicerts future financial performance or other events indicate that the value of Valicerts recorded goodwill is impaired,
Valicert may be required to record impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on Valicerts reported results. 



Legislative
actions and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause Valicerts general and administrative expenses to increase and impact Valicerts future financial position and results of operations. 

In order to comply with the newly adopted Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as well as proposed changes to listing standards by Nasdaq, and proposed accounting changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Valicert may be required to increase Valicerts internal controls, hire additional personnel and
additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which could cause Valicerts general and administrative costs to increase. Proposed changes in the accounting rules, including legislative and other proposals to account for
employee stock options as compensation expense among others, could increase the expenses that Valicert reports under GAAP and adversely affect Valicerts operating results. 

Risks Related to the Combined Company 

In addition to the risk factors related to the merger set forth above, following the merger, the combined company will be subject to each of the risks discussed below. Any of the following risks that relate specifically to
either Tumbleweed or Valicert will be equally applicable to the combined company. 

The business of the combined company may suffer if it is unable to protect intellectual property. 

Although Tumbleweed and Valicert regard intellectual property rights as critical to success, the combined company may not be able to
obtain the protection it seeks on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy selected portions of Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products or obtain and use information that each
regards as proprietary. In particular, Tumbleweed relies on the utility patent Tumbleweed obtained relating to the web-based delivery method as critical to Tumbleweeds competitive position. Attempts by competitors to utilize this or other
intellectual property could undermine the combined companys ability to retain or secure customers on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, competing companies could independently develop similar technology. Valicert does not typically
obtain signed license agreements from corporate, government and institutional customers who license products directly. Rather, Valicert includes an electronic version of a shrink-wrap license in all electronically distributed software and a printed
license in the box for products distributed through traditional distributors in order to protect copyrights and trade secrets in those products. Since none of these licenses are signed by the licensee, many legal authorities believe that these types
of licenses may not be enforceable under the laws of many states and foreign jurisdictions. Some end-user license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable under the
laws of some jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. The combined companys attempts to protect proprietary rights in
the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate. In particular, Tumbleweed is currently engaged in litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, which may not be successful and will result in substantial expenditures of resources to pursue.

The status of U.S. patent protection in the
software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office grants additional patents. Tumbleweeds pending patent applications, as well as patents the combined company may seek in the future, ultimately may
not be issued with the scope of the claims sought, if at all. In addition, because patent applications in the U.S. are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to the combined
companys products and services. 

Any
claim of infringement by third parties could be costly to defend. 

Intellectual property claims can be time consuming to defend, divert managements attention and resources and cause product shipment delays. These claims could require Tumbleweed or Valicert to enter into royalty or
license agreements. Furthermore, the combined company could be required to incur costly attorneys fees and other legal expenses associated with prosecuting or defending against intellectual property claims. The outcome of these claims are
uncertain and could result in a ruling adverse to the combined company, which could require 



payment of damages for past infringing use and possibly treble damages. A successful claim of product infringement against the combined
company could harm the combined companys business and prospects. Either of Tumbleweed or Valicert could face a claim of infringement by third parties with respect to Tumbleweeds or Valicerts current or future products or services.
In addition, the combined company may increasingly become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and services increasingly overlap. Because the
combined company is in a new and evolving market, customers may demand features that could increase the likelihood of infringement claims. 

Tumbleweed and Valicert are dependent on technologies provided by third parties, and the termination of any relationships with these
third parties could increase costs, delay product development and harm the combined companys reputation. 

Tumbleweed has developed Tumbleweed Secure Guardian partially based on selected technologies developed by third parties that Tumbleweed
has licensed under non-exclusive agreements. The inability to obtain new contractual relationships or maintain existing relationships could increase the combined companys cost of revenue, delay product development, damage relationships with
customers and divert resources, which could harm the combined companys business and prospects. In addition, existing agreements may be terminated by the other parties to these contracts, or may not be renewed on favorable terms and neither
Tumbleweed nor Valicert may be able to license new technologies on favorable terms, if at all. 

In particular, Tumbleweeds ability to provide data security is critical to its success. For some security algorithms, Tumbleweed uses technology licensed in perpetuity from RSA Data Security,
Inc. 

The combined companys products may
be vulnerable to security breaches. 

The
combined companys success depends on the confidence of customers and the end-users of those customers in the combined companys ability to securely transmit confidential information over the Internet. Any failure to provide secure online
communication services could harm the combined companys business and reputation. Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and
authentication necessary to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. Despite the focus on Internet security, the combined company may be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of
communications by customers or their end-users. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used by Valicerts or
Tumbleweeds products to protect data contained in customer databases and the information being transferred. 

Although Tumbleweed and Valicert generally limit warranties and liabilities relating to security in customer contracts, customers or the
end-users of those customers may seek to hold the combined company liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to communications. The combined company may not have adequate insurance to cover these losses. The combined company
may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against these security breaches or to alleviate the problems caused. Moreover, concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the Internet and commercial online
services, which may be heightened by any well-publicized compromise of security, may also deter future customers and their end-users from using the combined companys products. In particular, these concerns could cause current customers to
cease using the combined companys products as a means of providing secure online communication services. In either case, this could harm the combined companys business and prospects. The security measures of the combined company may not
be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and failure to prevent security breaches could harm the combined companys reputation, business and prospects. 

The combined companys products may be vulnerable to viruses and other disruptions. 

Despite the implementation of security measures by customers
and other third parties, customers servers or systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. The 



combined companys products may not be able to prevent any or all of these disruptions, and failure to do so could limit use of those
products, cause customers to incur substantial expenses, and otherwise harm customers business. Specifically, computer viruses, break-ins and other disruptions could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data or the inability to accept and
confirm the receipt of information. Anyone who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in the operations of the combined company, its customers or the end-users of those customers.
This could occur through the introduction of known or undetected errors, or bugs, viruses or by other means. In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose the combined company to
litigation or a significant loss of revenue. 

Products may not be satisfactorily designed to meet customer needs. 

Tumbleweeds revenue depends on the number of customers who use Tumbleweed Secure Guardian to provide secure online communication services. Valicerts success also depends on maintaining
customer satisfaction with its Secure Transport and Validation Authority products. Accordingly, the satisfactory design of Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products and products licensed from third parties is critical to the combined
companys business, and any significant product design limitations or deficiencies could harm the combined companys business and market acceptance. To date, the features and functionalities reflected in Tumbleweeds products and
services have been based on its internal design efforts and on feedback from a limited number of customers and potential customers, which may not be an adequate assessment of customer requirements. Therefore, currently specified features and
functionality of Tumbleweeds products and services may not satisfy current or future customer demands. Similarly, Valicert may be required to upgrade and update its existing products, modify and enhance acquired products and introduce new
products to meet customer demands. Furthermore, even if the combined company identifies the feature set required by customers in their markets, it may not be able to design and implement products and services incorporating features in a timely and
efficient manner, if at all. 

If the combined
company fails to develop and introduce new products and services timely and successfully, it will not be able to compete effectively and its ability to generate revenues will suffer. 

The combined company will operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and its future
success depends on its ability to develop and introduce new products and services that its customers and end users choose to buy. If the combined company is unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to
end users, its business and operating results would be negatively impacted because it would not be able to compete effectively and the ability to generate revenues would suffer. 

The development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation.
The development process is also lengthy and costly. If Tumbleweed fails to anticipate end users needs and technological trends accurately or are otherwise unable to complete the development of products and services in a timely fashion, it will
be unable to introduce new products and services into the market to successfully compete. We cannot assure you that the combined company will be able to introduce these or other products on a timely or cost-effective basis or that customer demand
for these products will meet expectations. 

Product deficiencies may be difficult to resolve and could harm the combined companys businesses. 

Deficiencies in product design, performance and reliability could result in lost revenue, delays in customer acceptance or lawsuits and
would be detrimental to the combined companys market reputation. Software products as complex as those offered by the combined company, which incorporate products from third parties, often contain bugs or performance problems. Serious defects
are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. The combined companys products, and the products incorporated from third parties, are not error-free. Undetected
errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future. Moreover, known errors that Tumbleweed or Valicert consider minor may be considered serious by the customer. 



If internal
quality assurance testing or customer testing reveals performance issues and/or desirable feature enhancements, the combined company could postpone the development and release of updates or enhancements to current products, future products or
improvements in services. The combined company may not be able to successfully complete the development of planned or future products in a timely manner or to adequately address product defects, which could harm its business and prospects. In
addition, product defects may expose the combined company to product liability claims, for which there may be insufficient product liability insurance. A successful suit against the combined company could harm its business and financial condition.

The combined company may be unable to recruit
or retain qualified personnel, which could harm businesses and product development. 

The combined company must continue to identify, recruit, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, technical, managerial, editorial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition
for these personnel is intense, and the combined company may be unable to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, each may encounter difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of sales
personnel and qualified software developers, and may not be able to retain these sales personnel and developers, which could harm relationships with Tumbleweeds or Valicerts existing and future customers at a critical stage of
development. The failure to recruit and retain necessary sales, technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, marketing and customer service personnel could harm business and the ability to obtain new customers and develop new products.

The combined companys business is
subject to continuous technological change, and it may not be able to respond successfully to the changing needs of their industries. 

The online communication services industry and policy management industry are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user
and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions and new industry standards and practices that could render Tumbleweeds and Valicerts existing services, proprietary technology and systems
obsolete. If the combined company is unable to adapt or respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, its business and prospects could be harmed. The combined
company must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of their services, particularly in response to competitive offerings. In particular, because the technologies of Tumbleweeds partners, such as Oracle databases,
Netscape web servers and digital certificate and encryption technology from VeriSign and RSA provide a foundation for Tumbleweeds products, changes in those technologies and markets could affect the demand for Tumbleweed Secure Guardian.

The combined company must also enhance their
existing services, develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of current and prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a
cost-effective and timely basis. New products or enhancements may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. New products with new technological capabilities could replace or shorten the life cycle of Valicerts products or
cause customers to defer or cancel purchases. The development of proprietary technology entails significant technical challenges such as integrating new technology into an existing platform and requires substantial expenditures and lead-time. The
combined company may not be able to utilize new technologies effectively or adapt their products to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. 

Risks Related To the Combined Companys Industries 

Because Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products utilize the Internet, if use of the Internet to achieve secure communications does not increase, or the architecture of the Internet is
altered, the level of use of our products will suffer. 

If the Internet and other products and services necessary for the utilization of the products of Tumbleweed and Valicert are not sufficiently developed, fewer customers and end-users will use our products and our business 



will be harmed. In particular, the success of both Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products and services will depend on the development
and maintenance of adequate Internet infrastructure, such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and other features demanded by users. Moreover, each companys success will also depend on the timely development
of complementary products or services such as high-speed Internet connections for providing reliable access and services and this may not occur. Moreover, changes in the architecture of the Internet may limit the success of our products. Because the
online exchange of information is new and evolving, the Internet may not prove to be a viable platform for secure messaging applications in the long term. The Internet has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant growth in
the numbers of users and amount of traffic. As the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users and frequency of use, or if its users require increasingly more resources, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the
demands placed on it. As a result, the performance or reliability of the Internet may be harmed. This in turn could decrease the level of Internet usage and also the level of utilization of our products and services. 

Additional government regulation relating to the Internet
may increase costs of doing business or require changes in the business model of Tumbleweed or Valicert. 

Tumbleweed and Valicert are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to
companies utilizing the Internet. Although at present there are relatively few specific laws and regulations directly applicable to the Internet, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These
laws could cover issues like user privacy, pricing, content, intellectual property, distribution, taxation, antitrust, legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and services. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations could
decrease the demand for the products and services of Tumbleweed or Valicert and increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the business or prospects of Tumbleweed or Valicert. Delays in the enactment of expected regulations may result in
delayed software purchasing by our customers who are subject to such regulations, which in turn may harm our business. 

Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like property ownership, sales and
other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce. New state tax
regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing
laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could harm our ability to conduct business and harm operating results. 

Tumbleweeds and Valicerts products are subject to export controls, and we may be unable to obtain necessary export
approvals. 

Exports of software products
utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the U.S. and various foreign governments. All cryptographic products require export licenses from certain U.S. government agencies. Tumbleweed has obtained approval to export products using
up to 128-bit symmetric encryption and 1024-bit public key encryption, including the products formerly named IME Server, IME Desktop, IME Receive Applet, IME Remote API using OmniORB with SSL, MMS WorldWide/56 and MMS Strong WorldWide/128. Valicert
has obtained approval to export all of its products. Neither Valicert nor Tumbleweed is exporting other products and services that are subject to export control under U.S. law. However, the list of products and countries for which export approval is
required, and the related regulatory policies, could be revised, and Tumbleweed or Valicert may not be able to obtain necessary approval for the export of future products. The inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could
limit Valicert or Tumbleweeds ability to make international sales. Furthermore, competitors may also seek to obtain approvals to export products that could increase the amount of competition each of Tumbleweed and Valicert faces. Additionally,
countries outside of the U.S. could impose regulatory restrictions impairing the ability of Tumbleweed or Valicert to import their respective products into those countries. 



Costs of
communicating via the Internet could increase if access fees are imposed. 

Certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the Internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure, and that many areas with high Internet
use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service. These carriers have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to impose access fees on Internet service providers and online service providers. If these access fees are imposed,
the costs of communicating on the Internet could increase substantially, potentially slowing the increasing use of the Internet. This could in turn decrease demand for services of Valicert and Tumbleweed or increase the costs of doing business.

Tumbleweed and Valicert may have liability
for Internet content. 

As a provider of
Internet communication products and services, Tumbleweed and Valicert face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted
online. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could be costly and could require us to implement measures to reduce exposure to this liability. This may require
Tumbleweed and Valicert to expend substantial resources or to discontinue selected service or product offerings. 

Tumbleweed and Valicert do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by users of our product but may be exposed to liability with
respect to this content. Furthermore, certain foreign governments, such as Germany, have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the Internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the U.S. Other countries,
such as China, regulate or prohibit the transport of telephonic data in their territories. Failure to comply with regulations in a particular jurisdiction could result in fines or criminal penalties or the termination of service in one or more
jurisdictions. Moreover, the increased attention focused on liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet use. Liability insurance may not cover claims of these types, or may not be adequate
to indemnify against all liability that may be imposed. 



THE STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS 

General 

The annual
meeting of Tumbleweed stockholders will be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on April 

, 2003, at Tumbleweeds corporate headquarters at 700 Saginaw Drive, Redwood City, California for the purposes set forth in
the notice of the Tumbleweed annual meeting. The special meeting of Valicert stockholders will be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on April 

, 2003, at Valicerts executive offices at 1215 Terra Bella Avenue,
Mountain View, California, for the purposes set forth in the notice of the Valicert special meeting. 

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors of each of Tumbleweed and
Valicert of proxies to be used at the meetings and at any and all adjournments or postponements of the meetings. Any person executing a proxy card may revoke it prior to its exercise by filing with the secretary of Tumbleweed or Valicert, as the
case may be, prior to or at the applicable stockholder meeting, at the address specified in Where You Can Find More Information, either an instrument revoking the proxy or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. 

Voting Securities and Record Dates 

Tumbleweed.
    At the close of business on April 

, 2003, or the Tumbleweed record date, there were

 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tumbleweed issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote at the Tumbleweed annual meeting, 

 of which, or approximately

%, were beneficially owned by directors and executive officers of Tumbleweed and their affiliates, excluding shares subject to options, and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 



Each share of Tumbleweed common stock issued and outstanding on the Tumbleweed record date entitles the stockholder of record thereof to one vote on each matter to
be voted upon at the Tumbleweed annual meeting. 



The presence, in person or by proxy, at the Tumbleweed annual meeting of the holders of a majority of the shares of Tumbleweed common stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote on the Tumbleweed record date is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Tumbleweed annual meeting. 



All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and
broker non-votes. 



Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for
a beneficial owner votes on one proposal pursuant to discretionary authority or instructions from the beneficial owner, but does not vote on another proposal because the broker has not received instructions from the beneficial owner and does not
have discretionary authority to vote on that proposal without instructions. 



The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Tumbleweed common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Tumbleweed annual meeting
and entitled to vote is required in order to approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock under the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal; broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on
this proposal. 



Tumbleweed directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Tumbleweed annual meeting. The two director nominees, who receive the greatest number of
affirmative votes at the Tumbleweed annual meeting, will be elected Class I directors. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the election of directors. 



The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Tumbleweed common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Tumbleweed annual
meeting and entitled to vote is required to 



ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for Tumbleweed for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003. Abstentions will have
the same effect as votes against the proposal; broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal. 

Valicert.
    Only holders of record of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Valicert as of
the close of business on April 

, 2003, or the Valicert record date, will be entitled to vote at the Valicert special meeting. At that date, there were

 shares of Valicert common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote,

 of which, or approximately 

 %, were beneficially owned by
directors and executive officers of Valicert and their affiliates, excluding shares subject to warrants and options. 



Stockholders of record on the Valicert record date are entitled to one vote for each share of Valicert common stock held on all matters to be voted upon at the
Valicert special meeting. 



The presence at the Valicert special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Valicert common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote on the Valicert record date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Valicert special meeting. 



The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Valicert common stock is required in order to adopt and approve the merger
agreement and approve the merger and the related transactions. 

A properly executed proxy marked 
abstain
,
 although counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and for purposes of determining the aggregate voting power and
number of shares represented and entitled to vote at each of the stockholder meetings, will not be voted. Accordingly, because the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Valicert common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote is required for adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the transactions associated with it at the Valicert special meeting, a proxy marked 
abstain
,
 will have the effect of a vote against this
proposal. 

All votes will be tabulated by the
inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. At the stockholder meetings, shares represented by broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of
determining the existence of a quorum but will not be included in vote totals. Accordingly, a broker non-vote at the Valicert special meeting will have the effect of a vote against the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it.

Purpose of Stockholder Meetings 

Tumbleweed Annual Meeting 

The purpose of the Tumbleweed annual meeting is to consider and approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock, including the conversion of warrants and options to purchase shares of Valicert common stock into warrants and
options to purchase shares of Tumbleweed common stock, in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement, as well as other matters to be voted upon at the annual meeting. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint
proxy statement /prospectus. 

Valicert Special
Meeting 

The purpose of the Valicert special
meeting is to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger and related transactions, including the merger of Velocity Acquisition Sub with and into Valicert with Valicert as the surviving corporation. A copy of the merger agreement
is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses 

All shares of Tumbleweed common stock represented by properly executed proxies received prior to or at the Tumbleweed annual meeting, and not duly and timely revoked, and all shares of Valicert common stock represented by properly
executed proxies received prior to or at the Valicert special meeting, and not duly and 



timely revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on such proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly
executed returned proxy, the proxy will be voted 
for
 the respective proposals. 

Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked at any time before the proxy is voted. Attendance at the Tumbleweed annual
meeting or the Valicert special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy. Please note, however, that if a stockholders shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and the stockholder wishes to vote
at the meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholders beneficial ownership of the shares and that the broker, bank or other nominee is not voting the shares.

The stockholder meetings may be adjourned for
the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. Shares represented by proxies voting against the approval of the merger agreement and the related transactions will be voted against a proposal to adjourn the relevant stockholder meeting for the purpose
of soliciting additional proxies. 

Copies of
solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. Tumbleweed and Valicert may reimburse
persons representing beneficial owners of common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. 

Each of Tumbleweed and Valicert will bear its own costs of soliciting proxies and mailing and the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the filing and printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus will be jointly borne by Tumbleweed and Valicert. 

To the extent necessary to ensure sufficient representation at their respective stockholder meetings, Tumbleweed or Valicert may request,
pursuant to interviews by telephone, facsimile or otherwise, the return of proxy cards. The extent to which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxy cards are returned. Stockholders are urged to send in their proxies without
delay. 

Neither Valicert stockholders nor
Tumbleweed stockholders should send in any stock certificates with their proxy cards. A transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates for Valicert common stock will be mailed to Valicert stockholders as soon as
practicable after the consummation of the merger. 



MATTERS TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE TUMBLEWEED ANNUAL MEETING 

Proposal 1: Issuance of Shares of Tumbleweed Common Stock in the Merger with Valicert 

On February 18, 2003, the Tumbleweed board of directors adopted a resolution approving the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock
in the merger with Valicert. These shares will not be issued unless the merger is completed. This share issuance proposal is being submitted for approval by the stockholders of Tumbleweed pursuant to the requirements of the National Association of
Securities Dealers applicable to companies with securities quoted on The Nasdaq National Market. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Tumbleweed common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote at the annual meeting is required to approve the issuance of shares of Tumbleweed common stock pursuant to the merger. 

For a detailed description of the merger, please see the section of this document entitled The Merger and the Related
Transactions beginning on page 51. 

THE
TUMBLEWEED BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 
FOR
 THE ISSUANCE OF TUMBLEWEED STOCK IN THE MERGER WITH VALICERT. 

Proposal 2: Election of Directors 

The Tumbleweed board of directors is currently comprised of seven directors. The Tumbleweed certificate of incorporation divides the board
into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. One class of directors is elected by the stockholders at each annual meeting to serve a three-year term or until their successors are
duly elected and qualified. 

The Class I
directors, Jeffrey C. Smith and Kenneth R. Klein, will stand for reelection at the 2003 annual meeting. Mr. Smith is a co-founder of Tumbleweed and has served as chairman of the board of directors of Tumbleweed since 1993. Mr. Klein is the Chief
Operating Officer of Mercury Interactive and has served on the Tumbleweed board of directors since February 2000. 

If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve, or for good cause will not serve, as a director, the proxies may be voted for such
substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. We are not aware of any nominee who will be unable to serve, or for good cause will not serve, as a director. 

The names of the nominees for election as Class I directors at the 2003 annual meeting and of the incumbent
Class II and Class III directors, and certain information about them as of March 12, 2003, are set forth on page 123. The Class II directors, Dr. Rieman and Mr. Sabella, will stand for reelection or election at the 2004 annual meeting. The
Class III directors, Mr. Marquardt, Mr. OGrady and Mr. Greendale, will stand for reelection or election at the 2005 annual meeting. 

Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting. The two director nominees who receive the greatest number of
affirmative votes at the annual meeting will be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not affect the outcome of the vote on the election of directors. 

THE TUMBLEWEED BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 
FOR
 EACH NAMED NOMINEE FOR
CLASS I DIRECTOR. 

Proposal 3: Ratification of Selection of
Independent Auditors 

The Tumbleweed board
of directors has selected KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003 and has further directed that management submit the selection of independent auditors for ratification by the stockholders at the Tumbleweed
annual meeting. KPMG LLP has audited our 



financial statements since 1997. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to
make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 

Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent auditors is not required by the Tumbleweed bylaws or otherwise. The Tumbleweed board, however, is submitting the selection of
KPMG LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the audit committee of the Tumbleweed board and the board itself will reconsider whether or not to retain that
firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee and the board in their discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best
interests of us and our stockholders. 

The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Tumbleweed annual meeting will be required to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP. 

THE TUMBLEWEED BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A
VOTE 
FOR
 THE SELECTION OF KPMG LLP AS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2003. 

INDEPENDENCE OF MERGER PROPOSAL FROM OTHER PROPOSALS 

The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon the effecting or approval of the other proposals by the
Tumbleweed stockholders set forth above. 



MATTERS TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE VALICERT SPECIAL MEETING 

Proposal 1: Adoption and Approval of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the Merger and the Related Transactions
with Tumbleweed 

The Valicert board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Valicert and its stockholders, approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
declared that it is in the best interests of Valicerts stockholders that you adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger and the related transactions on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. 

For a detailed description of the merger, please see the
section of this document entitled The Merger and the Related Transactions beginning on page 51. 

The adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the related transactions will require the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Valicert common stock. 

THE VALICERT BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 

FOR

 THE ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS. 



THE MERGER AND THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS 

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus highlights selected information regarding the proposed merger and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We encourage you to read the entire
joint proxy statement/prospectus for a complete description of the merger. You should also review the other available information referred to in the section entitled Where You Can Find More Information on page 187. 

Background of the Merger 

In March 2002, Mr. Doug Sabella, President of Tumbleweed Communications Corp., informally contacted Mr. Joseph Amram, the then Chief Executive Officer of Valicert, Inc., to discuss the possibility of a business combination.
Thereafter, members of Tumbleweeds management team met with members of Valicerts management team. The parties reviewed potential synergies from a business combination and discussed respective sales strategies, product offerings,
organizational structures and personnel. Based on these discussions, the parties entered into a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement and agreed to conduct preliminary due diligence. 

From March 2002 through May 2002, management of each company met various times to conduct preliminary due
diligence and exchange information. 

In April
2002, Valicert retained SoundView Technology Corporation to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential business combination with Tumbleweed, and Tumbleweed retained Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to act as its financial advisor.

On June 3, 2002, the board of directors of
Tumbleweed met and discussed the status of negotiations with Valicert. During the discussions, Mr. David Marquardt, a member of the Tumbleweed board of directors, informed the Tumbleweed board that August Capital L.P., the investment fund where he
was a general partner, was a significant stockholder of Valicert. Consequently, the board approved the formation of a special committee of independent directors that excluded Mr. Marquardt to review and evaluate a potential business combination with
Valicert. 

Later in June 2002, Tumbleweed and
Valicert terminated discussions regarding a potential business combination. 

On December 18, 2002, Mr. Jeff Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Tumbleweed, and Mr. Sabella met with Mr. John Vigouroux, Valicerts new and current President and Chief Executive Officer, to
discuss any potential mutual interest in a merger. The parties discussed their respective market positions and financial resources. The parties agreed to continue further discussions regarding a potential business combination. 

On January 7, 2003, members of Tumbleweeds management
again met with members of Valicerts management to discuss renewed interest in a potential business combination. The parties discussed their respective businesses and the strategic rationale and potential benefits of a potential business
combination. 

On January 13, 2003, Messrs. Smith
and Sabella met with Mr. Vigouroux to continue discussion related to a potential business combination. Due diligence of each company ensued. 

On January 17, 2003, representatives of Tumbleweed and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Tumbleweeds legal advisors, met

combination. 

On January 21, 2003, the Tumbleweed
board of directors and its special committee met to discuss the renewed discussions regarding a potential business combination with Valicert. The special committee discussed the potential merits of a business combination with Tumbleweed management

2003, the Valicert board of directors convened a meeting with senior management and representatives of Gray Cary and SoundView Technology Corporation to discuss the terms of the proposed merger with Tumbleweed. The board of directors discussed the

board of directors. Mr. Johnston recused himself from the meeting prior to the Valicert board of directors instructing Valicerts management with respect to the proposed terms of the merger. 

On January 24, 2003, the Tumbleweed board of directors and its
special committee convened a meeting with senior management and representatives of Skadden, Arps to discuss the terms of a proposal for a merger with Valicert. At the meeting, the board continued to discuss the role of the special committee of
independent directors in evaluating a potential merger and after further consideration determined to further limit the composition of the special committee membership to Mr. Chris Greendale, Mr. Ken Klein, Mr. Standish OGrady and
Ms. Deborah Reiman. The board of directors and its special committee discussed the prospects of a merger, the potential risks involved and valuation issues. 

On January 29, 2003, the Tumbleweed board of directors and its special committee convened a meeting with
senior management, its financial advisers, and representatives of Skadden, Arps to discuss the status of negotiations with Valicert and the most recently proposed terms for the merger agreement. The board of directors and its special committee
evaluated alternatives and discussed issues related to valuation and structure of the proposed merger. 

On February 5, 2003, Tumbleweed and Valicert signed an exclusivity agreement and each began a comprehensive due diligence review of the
other company. Furthermore, Tumbleweed, Valicert and their respective legal and financial advisors met in the offices of Skadden, Arps to address various issues. 

From February 5, 2003 through February 18, 2003, each companys management team and their respective
financial and legal advisors met in person or by telephone with their counterparts to conduct due diligence, which included customer inquiries, technology reviews, and extensive financial due diligence. During the same time period, each

Reasons for the Merger 

General 

The boards of
directors of Tumbleweed and Valicert each approved the merger agreement, found the merger to be fair, advisable and in the best interests of, the applicable company and its stockholders, and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
applicable company vote in favor of the Tumbleweed merger proposal or the Valicert merger proposal, as the case may be. 



In reaching
their separate decisions, each board consulted with its senior management, legal advisors and financial advisors and considered a number of factors. In view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and negative,
considered by each board, neither board found it practical to qualify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors it considered. In addition, neither board reached any specific conclusion with respect to each of the
factors it considered, or any aspect of any particular factor. Instead, each board conducted an overall analysis of the factors it considered. In considering those factors, individual members of each board may have given weight to different factors.
Each board considered all of those factors as a whole and believed that those factors supported its decision. 

The factors considered by each board were not identical to the factors considered by the other board. However, both boards identified a
number of potential material benefits, common to both companies and their respective stockholders, that both boards expect will result from the merger, as well as a number of risks affecting both companies in connection with the merger and certain
other considerations common to both companies. These benefits, risks and other considerations are described immediately below. Following the discussion of those matters, the separate factors, both positive and negative, that each board separately
considered are described. This section, read as a whole, includes the material factors considered by each board in approving the merger. 

Joint Reasons for the Merger 

Both boards believe that the combination of Tumbleweed and Valicert will create a stronger, more competitive industry participant, based
on the potential benefits of the merger, including: 



the opportunity to preserve and enhance stockholder value by combining two complementary businesses; 



the complementary nature of the products, services, technologies, operating requirements, and vendors of Tumbleweed and Valicert; 



the opportunity to provide an integrated product and service offering that addresses a much wider range of customer requirements for secure business communication
over the internet than either company could provide alone, thus increasing the value that can be provided to customers; 



the potential for the merger to increase the ability of each company to achieve profitability; 



the opportunity to reduce overhead and other costs; 



the potential for increasing Valicerts separate revenues as a result of increased financial strength provided by Tumbleweed; 



the potential for cross-selling opportunities; 



the potential for increasing customer reliance through technology and vendor consolidation; 



credibility from each companys strong reputation in the secure internet communication industry; and 



similarities in corporate structure. 

In the course of their separate deliberations, each board considered the following factors: 



the substantial charges and costs to be incurred in connection with the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and legal, accounting and other
transaction expenses arising from the merger; 



the prospects of the subject company on a stand-alone basis, including potential risks and rewards associated with remaining independent in the face of industry-wide
consolidation; 



the nature of the industry in which Tumbleweed and Valicert operate and the belief of the boards that greater size and resources are increasingly required for
companies to successfully compete in this industry; 



current financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to Tumbleweed common stock;





results of the due diligence investigation conducted by management, accountants, legal counsel, and financial advisors; 



the percentage ownership of the combined company of the stockholders of Tumbleweed and Valicert; and 



possible alternative means of achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger, including the possibility of a combination with other companies and possible
strategic alliances that would not involve a combination. 

Both boards also recognize the risks inherent in the transaction, including: 



the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized; 



the need to achieve significant cost reductions in order for the combined company to realize the potential benefits of the merger and to become profitable;



the uncertain current and prospective market environment for Tumbleweed and Valicert products and services; 



the risk of declining sales revenues; 



the risk that Tumbleweed and Valicert would not be able to integrate their respective products, technology and organizations; 



the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger, including the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical, sales
and management personnel might not remain employed by the combined company; 



the impact of the merger on the customers and vendors of Tumbleweed, Valicert and the combined company; 



the risk that the merger may not be consummated, notwithstanding the voting agreements obtained from stockholders; 



the risk that if the merger is not completed, actions taken by Tumbleweed and Valicert to prepare for the merger could substantially weaken both Tumbleweed and
Valicert as independent companies; 



the potential effect of the non-solicitation covenants in deterring other potential acquirers from proposing an alternative transaction to Valicert that might be
more advantageous to the stockholders of Valicert; and 



the other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under in the section entitled RISK FACTORS. Both boards determined that the potential
benefits of the merger outweighed the potential risks. 

Each board also determined that the provisions of the merger agreement, including the exchange ratio, the parties representations and warranties, covenants, and the conditions to their respective obligations, were the
reasonable product of arms length negotiations. Each board concluded that the terms of the relevant documents reasonably protected the interests of the applicable companys stockholders and did not present any significant impediments to
proceeding with the merger considering all of the circumstances. 

Reasons for Tumbleweed Engaging in the Merger 

In addition to the joint reasons for the merger, Tumbleweeds board believed that the combined company would benefit from the following: 



access to Valicerts installed base of customers; 



access to the experience and skills of Valicerts management team; 





immediate, significant presence in the secure data transfer and certificate validation market, which does the following: 



complements Tumbleweed presence in the secure messaging market segment; 



provides a point of entry in a new, growing market segment; 



enhances opportunity to command a larger share of the secure internet communication sector as a whole; and 



increased product breadth in secure Internet communication solutions for existing Tumbleweed customers. 

Tumbleweeds board reviewed a number of additional
factors in evaluating the merger, including the following: 



information concerning Valicerts business, financial performance and condition, particularly its potential for profitability, cash balances, cash flow,
operating performance, technological capabilities and management experience; 



potential for the combined company to reduce costs, eliminate infrastructure redundancies and increase operating efficiency; 



the consideration Tumbleweed will issue in the merger in light of comparable merger transactions; 



Tumbleweeds senior management views regarding integration of Valicert; 



structure and terms of the merger and its effect on existing Tumbleweed stockholder value; and 



advice given by its financial advisors, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and RBC Capital Markets, particularly the analysis performed by and the opinion of RBC Capital
Markets (the full text of which is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus) to the effect that, as of February 18, 2003, the consideration to be paid by Tumbleweed in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to Tumbleweed. 

The foregoing
discussion of factors considered by the Tumbleweed board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to include the material factors considered. The Tumbleweed board of directors did not find it practical to and did not quantify
or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered and individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. 

The Tumbleweed board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties, including the challenges of combining the businesses of the
corporations and the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time. For further discussion of these risks, see the section of this document entitled Risk
Factors. 

Recommendation of the
Tumbleweed Board and Special Committee 

After due consideration, the Tumbleweed board of directors and the special committee of the board of directors, comprised of Mr. Chris Greendale, Mr. Ken Klein, Mr. Standish OGrady and Ms. Deborah Rieman, both
separately approved the merger and the related transactions and determined that the merger was fair to and in the best interests of Tumbleweed and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Tumbleweed board of directors and its special committee of
disinterested directors unanimously recommend that Tumbleweed stockholders vote 
FOR
 approval of the issuance of Tumbleweed common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. 



Reasons for
Valicert Engaging in the Merger 

Valicerts management has considered a number of alternatives for enhancing its competitive position. The Valicert board of directors believes that the combined strength and potential of Valicert and Tumbleweed presents a
significant opportunity for its stockholders, customers and employees, particularly given the complementary nature of the two companies products and the alignment of their strategic and operational plans. The Valicert board of directors
identified several potential benefits for the Valicert stockholders, employees and customers that it believes would result from the merger. These potential benefits include: 



providing Valicert stockholders with shares of Tumbleweed common stock in an exchange that is generally expected to be tax-free, which at the time the parties signed
the merger agreement represented a premium over the market price for Valicert common stock; 



the ability of the combined company to enhance Valicerts ability to grow its revenue and achieve profitability, by utilizing Tumbleweeds sales and
marketing strength to expand sales; 



the ability of the combined company to offer complementary product lines, which presents the opportunity to increase the breadth of products offered and expand the
customer base; 



the ability of the two companies to combine their technological resources to develop new products with increased functionality and bring them to market faster; and



the presence of complimentary customers with strong cross-selling opportunities that may be enhanced by the availability to the combined company of greater resources
for product marketing and distribution. 

Valicerts board reviewed a number of additional factors in evaluating the merger, including: 



information concerning Tumbleweeds business, financial performance and condition, particularly its potential for profitability, cash balances, cash flow,
operating performance, technological capabilities and management experience; 



potential for the combined company to reduce costs, eliminate infrastructure redundancies and increase operating efficiency; 



structure and terms of the merger and its effect on existing Valicert stockholder value; 



advice given by SoundView Technology Corporation, particularly its analysis and opinion (the full text of which is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) to the effect that, as of February 18, 2003, the consideration to be paid by Tumbleweed in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Valicert; 



the impact on Valicert, including its cash position and liability as a going concern, if the merger is not consummated, especially in light of the absence of a
reciprocal termination fee from Tumbleweed; and 



the effect of the $1 million termination fee possibly precluding other potential acquirors from proposing an alternative transaction to Valicert that might be more
advantageous to the stockholders of Valicert. 

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Valicert board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to include the material factors considered. The Valicert board of directors did not assign relative
weight to the specific factors considered and individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. 

The Valicert board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties, including the challenges of combining the businesses of the
corporations and the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time. For further discussion of these risks, see the section of this document entitled Risk
Factors. 



Recommendation of the Valicert Board and Special Committee 

After due consideration, the Valicert board of directors and
the special committee of independent directors of the board of directors, comprised of Mr. Taher Elgamal, Mr. John Johnston and Ms. Magdalena Yesil, both separately approved the merger agreement and the merger and the related transactions by a
unanimous vote and both determined that the merger agreement and the merger and the related transactions were in the best interests of Valicert and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Valicert board of directors and its special committee of
independent directors unanimously recommend that Valicert stockholders vote 
FOR
 approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger and the related transactions. 

Opinion of Tumbleweeds Financial Advisor 

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 23, 2003, RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., a division of RBC Capital Markets, was retained by Tumbleweed to furnish an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the exchange ratio. 

On
February 18, 2003, RBC rendered its opinion to Tumbleweeds board of directors, that, as of such date and based on the procedures followed, factors considered and assumptions made by RBC and certain other limitations, the exchange ratio was
fair, from a financial point of view, to Tumbleweed. A copy of RBCs written opinion is attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated into this document by reference. Tumbleweed stockholders are urged to read the opinion of RBC
carefully and in its entirety. 

RBCs
opinion was provided for the information and assistance of Tumbleweeds board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. RBCs opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote with respect to the merger. RBCs opinion related solely to the exchange ratio. RBC did not review, nor did its opinion in any way address, other merger terms or arrangements, including, without limitation, the financial or other
terms of any employment or non-competition agreement with Valicert management or any break-up or termination fee. Further, RBCs opinion did not address, nor should it be construed to address, the relative merits of the underlying decision by
Tumbleweed to engage in the merger compared to any alternative business strategies or transaction in which Tumbleweed might engage. RBC was not authorized to, and did not solicit any other potential participants relative to a business combination
with Tumbleweed or provide any advisory services with respect to the merger. RBC was not engaged as an agent or fiduciary of Tumbleweeds stockholders or any other third party. 

In rendering its opinion, RBC assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal,
tax, operating and other information provided by Tumbleweed and Valicert (including, without limitation, the financial statements and related notes thereto of Tumbleweed and Valicert). RBC did not assume responsibility for independently verifying
and did not independently verify this information. With respect to the data and discussions relating to the business prospects and financial outlook of Tumbleweed and Valicert, upon advice of Tumbleweed, RBC assumed that such data was reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Tumbleweed and Valicert as to the future financial performance of Tumbleweed and Valicert, respectively, and that Tumbleweed and Valicert will
perform substantially in accordance with such financial data and estimates. RBC expressed no opinion as to such financial data and estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. RBC was provided limited long-term projections on
Valicerts business; thus, RBC could not prepare a discounted cash flow analysis as a means to value Valicert. 

RBC did not assume responsibility for, and did not perform, any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the respective assets or
liabilities of Tumbleweed or Valicert, nor was RBC furnished with any evaluations or appraisals. RBC expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of any entity. RBC did not assume any obligation to conduct, and did not conduct, any physical
inspection of the property or facilities of Tumbleweed or Valicert. Additionally, RBC was not asked to and did not consider the possible effects of any litigation or other contingent matters. 



RBCs opinion speaks only as of the date of such opinion, and is based on market
conditions as they existed as of February 14, 2003 (the last trading day preceding the finalization of the analysis) and the information supplied to RBC as of the date of its opinion, and is without regard to market, economic, financial, legal or
other circumstances or events of any kind or nature which may exist or occur after such date. RBC has not undertaken to reaffirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date of the opinion and RBC does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. RBC expressed no opinion as to the price at which shares of Tumbleweed common stock have traded or at which such shares may trade following the announcement or consummation of the merger.

For purposes of its opinion, RBC assumed that
the merger will be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. RBC assumed that the executed merger agreement will be in all material respects identical to the last draft reviewed by RBC. RBC also assumed that the merger will be
consummated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, without material amendments thereto and without waiver by any party of any material conditions or obligations thereunder. 

In arriving at its opinion, RBC: 



reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft dated as of February 18, 2003 of the merger agreement; 



reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect to Tumbleweed and Valicert and certain other historical operating data
relating to Tumbleweed and Valicert made available to RBC from published sources and from the internal records of Tumbleweed; 



conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Valicert with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Valicert independently and as
combined; 



conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Tumbleweed with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Tumbleweed independently
and as combined; 



received and reviewed financial forecasts prepared by Valicerts management and adjustments made by Tumbleweed management, on the potential future performance
of Valicert as a stand alone entity; 



received and reviewed financial forecasts prepared by Tumbleweeds management on the potential future performance of Tumbleweed as a stand alone entity, and
compared such forecasts with publicly available institutional investment research estimates; 



reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Tumbleweed common stock and Valicert common stock; 



compared the implied historical exchange ratios between Tumbleweeds common stock and Valicerts common stock with the exchange ratio provisions of the
merger agreement; and 



reviewed selected market valuation metrics of Valicert, Tumbleweed and other comparable publicly-traded companies and their securities. 

In arriving at its opinion, in addition to reviewing the
matters listed above, RBC performed the following analyses: 



reviewed the financial terms and valuation metrics, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable merger transactions with those stated or implied by the
merger agreement; 



compared selected valuation metrics of comparable publicly-traded companies with those implied by the merger agreement; 



compared the premiums implied by the per share merger consideration and exchange ratio with those paid in selected precedent transactions;





compared the relative contribution to selected income statement items for each of Tumbleweed and Valicert with their pro forma ownership in the combined company; and



considered the projected pro forma effect of the merger on the combined companys earnings per share. 

In addition, RBC conducted such other analyses and
examinations and considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as RBC deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion. 

In delivering its opinion to the Tumbleweed board of directors, RBC prepared and delivered to Tumbleweeds board of directors written
materials containing various analyses and other information material to the opinion. The following is a summary of these materials, including information presented in tabular format. To understand fully the summary of the financial analyses used by
RBC, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analysis. 

Transaction Overview 

Giving effect to the exchange ratio of 0.385, the implied value of the consideration offered to Valicert was determined to be $0.46 per
share of Valicert common stock (based on the closing price for Tumbleweed common stock on February 14, 2003). Based on the number of outstanding Valicert common shares and common share equivalents, RBC calculated the aggregate implied value of the
stock consideration payable in the merger for Valicert common stock to be approximately $12.0 million (or $12.9 million assuming an estimated value of $0.9 million for the up to one million new Tumbleweed common stock options to be granted to
Valicert employees after the closing of the merger). RBC calculated the implied enterprise value of Valicert, including the estimated value of the new Tumbleweed options, to be approximately $10.1 million. Based on the exchange ratio, the common
shares issued to current holders of Valicert common shares would represent 24% of the Tumbleweed common shares outstanding on a pro forma combined basis. Taking into account common shares, options and other dilutive securities on a fully diluted
basis using the Treasury Stock Method of Accounting, per the exchange ratio, new securities issued by Tumbleweed would represent 24% on a pro forma combined basis. 

Historical Trading Analysis 

RBC reviewed the price performance of Valicert common stock since Valicerts initial public offering in
July 28, 2000. RBC compared Valicerts price performance to the Nasdaq and to a comparable company group over selected periods. RBC also reviewed the historical implied exchange ratio (as defined by Valicerts closing price per share
divided by Tumbleweeds closing price per share) over selected time periods. RBC provided summaries of the average stock trading history of Valicert common stock price and the average implied exchange ratios including:

Precedent Transaction Analysis 

RBC compared implied enterprise values to revenue multiples and equity values to net income and tangible book value multiples relating to the proposed merger of Tumbleweed and Valicert with multiples of the same 



operating data of target companies in selected merger and acquisition transactions involving companies in the network security industry that
were completed within the past two years and that had transaction values between $5 million and $50 million, which RBC deemed comparable to the transaction between Tumbleweed and Valicert. Financial data regarding the precedent transactions was
taken from SEC filings, press releases, public databases, RBC institutional research and other Wall Street sources. In analyzing the low, median, mean and high values for the transactions, five transactions were deemed to meet the aforementioned
criteria, including: NetIQ Corp.s acquisition of Marshal Software Ltd.; SafeNet, Inc.s acquisition of Cylink Corp.; Clearswift Corp.s acquisition of Baltimore Technologies plcs Content Technologies Division; SafeNet,
Inc.s acquisition of Pijnenburg Securealink, Inc.; and SonicWALL, Inc.s acquisition of RedCreek Communications, Inc. The following presents the resulting selected transaction multiples:

Comparable Company Analysis 

RBC analyzed selected valuation metrics implied by the exchange ratio relative to corresponding metrics observed in a selected group of
publicly traded companies in the security software industry that RBC deemed for purposes of its analysis to be comparable to Valicert. The group of comparable companies for Valicert included: RSA Security, Inc., ActivCard Corp., Netegrity, Inc.,
Entrust, Inc., Aladdin Knowledge Systems Ltd. and Vasco Data Security International, Inc. In this analysis, RBC compared: 



enterprise value of Valicert, expressed as a multiple of revenue in calendar year 2002 and projected revenue in calendar year 2003, to the low, median, mean and high
multiples of enterprise values of the comparable companies implied by the public trading price of their common stock, expressed as a multiple of the same operating data, 



share price of Valicert expressed as a multiple of net income per share in calendar year 2002 and projected net income per share in calendar year 2003, to the low,
median, mean and high multiples of share prices of the comparable companies, expressed as a multiple of the same operating data, and 



equity value of Valicert, expressed as a multiple of tangible book value, to the low, median, mean and high multiples of equity values of the comparable companies,
expressed as a multiple of the same operating data. 

Multiples of future revenue and net income data for Valicert were based on projections provided by the management of Valicert as adjusted by Tumbleweed management and, for the comparable companies, from publicly available research
analyst estimates. The following table presents the resulting selected valuation data:

Premiums Paid Analysis 

Stock Price Premiums:
 RBC conducted an analysis of
comparable merger stock price premiums by examining the terms of 36 selected acquisitions of publicly traded businesses in the software and services industries from 2001 through 2003, having transaction values between $5 million and $50 million,
which RBC considered reasonably comparable to the transaction. RBC compared the proposed transaction equity value per share to Valicerts stock price one day prior, one week prior, one month prior and one week average and one month average
prior to public announcement. 

As presented
below, the low, median, mean and high results for these transactions are compared to the implied premium for Valicert over a corresponding time period:

Exchange Ratio Premiums:
 RBC conducted an analysis of exchange ratio premiums paid for 16 stock-for-stock acquisitions of publicly
traded businesses in the software and services industries from 2001 through 2003, having transaction values between $5 million and $50 million, which RBC considered reasonably comparable to the transaction. RBC compared the proposed exchange ratio
to the implied exchange ratios one day prior, one week prior, one month prior and one week average and one month average prior to public announcement. Whereas the stock price premiums described above take into account the historical changes in only
Valicerts stock price, the exchange ratio premiums take into account changes in the historical implied exchange ratio, which is derived from the historical stock prices of both Tumbleweed and Valicert.

Pro Forma Analyses 

Contribution Analysis:
 RBC analyzed the relative contribution of each of Valicert and Tumbleweed in terms of various financial
statement metrics relative to the pro forma metrics for the combined company for the full calendar years 2002 and 2003. The financial statement categories included revenue, gross profit, earnings before interest and taxes, and net income. RBC
observed that, based upon the stock consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement, Valicert stockholders (on a fully-diluted basis using the Treasury Stock Method of 



Accounting) will receive 24.3% of the shares of the combined company. The following is a summary of this analysis for calendar years 2002 and

Accretion/Dilution:
 RBC analyzed the pro forma effects resulting from the proposed transaction on the
projected earnings per share of the combined company for 2003 using quarterly profit and loss estimates provided by Valicert management as adjusted by Tumbleweed management and estimates for Tumbleweed provided by Tumbleweed management. For
illustrative purposes, RBC assumed that the transaction would close on June 30, 2003. In addition, based on Tumbleweed management estimates, RBC included adjustments to the pro forma combined model to account for: 



adjustments in revenue to account for factors such as GAAP revenue recognition policies for revaluing deferred revenue of acquired companies;



potential cost synergies, and 



lost interest income due to cash costs associated with the transaction. 

Based on this analysis, excluding the impact of one-time and non-cash items, the transaction would not delay
Tumbleweeds profitability and would be accretive to pro forma earnings for calendar year 2003 relative to the projected stand-alone earnings per share of Tumbleweed. 

Other Considerations 

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves the application of subjective
business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to partial consideration of the
analyses or summary description. RBC believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete or
misleading view of the processes underlying its opinion. 

In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view, RBC did not find it practicable to assign relative weights to the factors
considered in reaching its opinion. No single company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is identical to Tumbleweed or Valicert or the proposed merger. The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of RBC providing an opinion
as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to Tumbleweed and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to
uncertainty. 

In connection with its analyses,
RBC made, and was provided by Tumbleweeds management, numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Tumbleweeds or Valicerts control.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Tumbleweed, Valicert, or their advisors, none of Tumbleweed, Valicert, RBC, or any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values are materially
different from these forecasts or assumptions. 



RBC, a member company of RBC Capital Markets, is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In 2000, RBC acted as co-manager of Tumbleweeds common stock public offering and acted as financial advisor to Tumbleweed in its acquisition of Interface Systems, Inc, for which RBC received a
customary fee. In the ordinary course of business, RBC acts as a market maker and broker in the publicly traded securities of Tumbleweed and receives customary compensation in connection therewith. RBC and its affiliates also actively trade
securities of Tumbleweed for their own accounts or the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may from time to time hold a long or short position in those securities. RBC also provides research coverage relating to the common stock of
Tumbleweed. 

Pursuant to the engagement letter,
Tumbleweed is to pay RBC a customary, nonrefundable fee upon the rendering of its opinion. Payment of this fee to RBC was not contingent upon the closing of the merger. Whether or not the transaction closes, Tumbleweed has agreed to reimburse RBC
for its out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify RBC against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of services performed by RBC in connection with the merger. The terms of the engagement letter were negotiated at arms length between
Tumbleweed and RBC, and Tumbleweeds board of directors was aware of this fee arrangement at the time of its approval of the merger agreement. 

Opinion of Valicerts Financial Advisor 

Valicert retained SoundView Technology Corporation to act as financial advisor and, if requested, to furnish an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
with Tumbleweed. The Valicert board of directors selected SoundView to act as Valicerts financial advisor based on SoundViews qualifications, expertise and reputation as well as its knowledge of the technology industry. On February 14,
2003, at the meeting of the board of directors held to evaluate the proposed merger, SoundView delivered to the Valicert board of directors an oral and written preliminary opinion, to the effect that, as of February 14, 2003, based upon the facts
and circumstances as they existed at that time, and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of review set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to Valicert stockholders. On February
18, 2003 at 8:30 a.m., PST, SoundView was asked to deliver an updated fairness opinion to the Valicert board of directors based upon the facts and circumstances as they existed at that time, subject to the assumptions made. The amount of the
consideration was determined through negotiations between Tumbleweed and Valicert and was not a result of recommendations by SoundView. 

The full text of the opinion delivered by SoundView to the Valicert board of directors dated February 18, 2003, which sets forth the
assumptions made, general procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by SoundView in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this document and is incorporated herein by reference. 

SoundViews opinion is directed to the Valicert board of
directors and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Valicert, of the exchange ratio. In furnishing its opinion, SoundView did not admit that it is an expert within the meaning of the term
expert as used in the Securities Act, nor did it admit that its opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

The summary of SoundViews opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its opinion in Annex
C. Valicert stockholders are urged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. 

In arriving at its opinion, SoundView: 



reviewed the merger agreement and the specific terms of the merger set forth therein; 



reviewed the accompanying exhibits to the merger agreement, including but not limited to the voting agreements; 





reviewed Valicerts financial and operating information for the three-year period ended December 31, 2001 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002, as
stated in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 



reviewed Tumbleweeds financial and operating information for three-year period ended December 31, 2001 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002, as
stated in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 



reviewed Valicerts and Tumbleweeds financial and operating information for the three-month period ended December 31, 2002 as stated in their respective
press releases; 



reviewed certain financial and operating information relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of Valicert, including forecasts and projections, provided
to us by the management of Valicert; 



reviewed certain financial and operating information relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of Tumbleweed, including forecasts and projections,
provided to us by the management of Valicert; 



reviewed certain publicly available financial information relating to certain other companies we deemed to be reasonably similar to Valicert and Tumbleweed and the
trading markets for certain of such companies securities; 



reviewed the financial terms of the merger and compared them with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain recent mergers and acquisitions
that we deemed relevant; 



conducted discussions with certain members of senior management of Valicert and Tumbleweed concerning their respective businesses and operations, assets, present
condition and future prospects; and 



performed such other analyses, examinations and procedures, reviewed such other agreements and documents, and considered such other factors as we have deemed, in our
sole judgment, to be necessary, appropriate or relevant to render the opinion set forth herein. 

In addition, SoundView took into account its assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in similar
transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation in general. The opinion of SoundView was necessarily based upon economic, market, financial and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date the opinion was
given. SoundView assumed no responsibility to update or revise its opinion based upon events or circumstances occurring after the date and time of delivery of its opinion. 

In arriving at its opinion, SoundView did not make, obtain or assume any responsibility for any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the properties and facilities or any of the assets and liabilities of either Valicert or Tumbleweed. SoundView assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information supplied to or
otherwise used by it in arriving at its opinion and did not attempt independently to verify, or undertake any obligation to verify, such information. SoundView relied upon the assurances of the managements of Valicert and Tumbleweed that they were
not aware of any facts that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. 

In addition, SoundView assumed that the forecasts and projections provided to SoundView by Valicert and reviewed by SoundView represent the best currently available estimates and judgements of
Valicerts and Tumbleweeds management as to the future financial condition and results of operations of Valicert and Tumbleweed, and have assumed that such forecasts and projections have been reasonably prepared based on such currently
available estimates and judgements. SoundView assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. 

SoundView did not express any opinion as to the prices at which Valicerts and Tumbleweeds stock
will trade prior to or subsequent to the closing of the merger. SoundViews opinion does not constitute a recommendation of the merger over any other alternative transactions which may be available to Valicert, does not address the underlying
business decision of the board of directors of Valicert to proceed with or effect the merger, or constitute a recommendation to the stockholders of Valicert as to how such stockholders should vote or as to any other action such stockholders should
take regarding the merger. 



The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments
and determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant assumptions and financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances involved. Fairness opinions are therefore not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Accordingly, SoundView believes that its analyses and the summary set forth below must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all analyses, or of the following
summary, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses performed by SoundView in connection with its opinion. In arriving at its opinion, SoundView did not attribute any
particular quantitative weight to any analyses or factors considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. 

The analyses performed by SoundView are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. The analyses were prepared solely as part of the SoundView analysis of the fairness to the stockholders of Valicert, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio. Additionally, analyses relating to the values of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses actually may be acquired. 

In accordance with customary investment banking practice, SoundView employed generally accepted valuation
methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by SoundView in connection with providing its opinion to the Valicert board of directors on February 18, 2003. Some of the summaries
of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. To fully understand the financial analyses, the tables should be read together with the text of each summary. Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering
the narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses. 

Analyses of the Merger Parties Relative Contribution

SoundView examined certain historical and
projected financial information of Valicert, Tumbleweed, and the combined entity. SoundView analyzed the pro forma contribution of Valicert to Tumbleweeds actual and projected software license revenue, total revenue and gross profit for the
calendar year ended December 31, 2002, the quarter ended December 31, 2002 and the projected calendar year ending December 2003. For each of these operating metrics, SoundView calculated a corresponding percentage contribution and then derived an
exchange ratio which provided Valicert stockholders with a corresponding percentage ownership in the combined entity, after adjusting for the cash net of debt contribution of each company. Specifically, using the software license revenue metric,
SoundView determined a relative equity contribution range of 14.2% to 20.6%, implying an exchange ratio range of 0.200 to 0.312. Using the total revenue metric, SoundView determined a relative equity contribution range of 17.6% to 20.3%, implying an
exchange ratio range of 0.257 to 0.307. Using the gross profit metric, SoundView determined a relative equity contribution range of 17.7% to 22.8%, implying an exchange ratio range of 0.260 to 0.356. SoundView observed that the implied exchange
ratios ranged between 0.200 and 0.356. 

Analyses of Comparable Publicly Traded Companies 

SoundView prepared a comparable company analysis to analyze Valicerts and Tumbleweeds implied valuation relative to a group of publicly traded companies that SoundView deemed (for purposes of its analysis) to be
comparable to Valicert and Tumbleweed. The companies analyzed by SoundView in connection with this analysis were: 

Security Software Companies:

Integration Infrastructure Companies:

Entrust, Inc.

IONA Technologies PLC

Netegrity, Inc.

Mercator Software, Inc.

RSA Security Inc.

Persistence Software, Inc.

SonicWALL, Inc.

Plumtree Software, Inc.

WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.

SeeBeyond Technology Corporation

Vitria Technology, Inc.



In this analysis, SoundView calculated enterprise value multiples based on actual and
projected revenue in calendar years 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the above comparable companies. Based on the range of these comparable company multiples and on Tumbleweeds and Valicerts actual and projected revenue in calendar years
2002 and 2003, respectively, SoundView calculated the implied enterprise value, equity value and stock price per share for both Tumbleweed and Valicert. The implied exchange ratio range was calculated from the implied stock prices per share.
SoundViews calculation of Valicerts exchange ratio was based on Valicerts cash net of debt of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 26.1 million diluted shares outstanding, and on Tumbleweeds cash net of debt of $29.1
million as of December 31, 2002 and 31.4 million diluted shares outstanding. 

SoundView analyzed the comparable company enterprise value to revenue multiples and, based upon certain subjective factors (in particular, the elimination of multiples at the extreme high and low ends
of the applicable range and modification of the resulting range of multiples as it deemed appropriate), selected what SoundView believed to be an appropriate multiple range of 0.2x to 0.8x for both calendar year 2002 and 2003. 

SoundView observed that based upon the analyses of comparable
publicly traded companies, the implied exchange ratio ranged between 0.103 and 0.444. 

Analysis of Comparable Transactions 

Using publicly available information, SoundView analyzed the purchase price and multiples paid in comparable merger and acquisition transactions announced between October 30, 2001 and January 27, 2003
involving vendors of software and related services that, in SoundViews judgment, were generally comparable to Valicert, and for which financial information was available. The transactions analyzed by SoundView were:

For each
of the target companies in the selected transactions, SoundView calculated a multiple of enterprise value to last-twelve-months (LTM) and next-twelve-months (NTM) revenue, if available, as of the date that the transaction was announced. Enterprise
value for each of the comparable transactions was computed based on the respective equity value less cash net of debt as of the latest actual balance sheet available. Based on the range of these transactions multiples, on Valicerts actual and
projected revenue in calendar years 2002 and 2003, and on the trading price for Tumbleweed common stock at 8:30 a.m., PST on February 18, 2003 of $1.35, SoundView calculated the implied exchange ratio range for Valicert. SoundViews calculation
of Valicerts exchange ratio was based on Valicerts cash net of debt of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 26.1 million diluted shares outstanding. 



SoundView analyzed the comparable company enterprise to LTM and NTM revenue multiples and,
based upon certain subjective factors (in particular, the elimination of multiples at the extreme high and low ends of the applicable range and modification of the resulting range of multiples as it deemed appropriate), selected what SoundView
believed to be an appropriate multiple range of 0.3x to 1.2x (for both LTM and NTM). 

SoundView observed that based upon the analysis of comparable transactions, the implied exchange ratio ranged between 0.163 and 0.520. 

Premiums Paid Analysis 

SoundView compared the implied premium based on the exchange ratio payable to holders of Valicert common
stock with the median premiums paid from approximately 70 software transactions announced since January 1, 2001. In this analysis, SoundView assumed an announcement date of February 18, 2003 at 8:30 a.m., PST, and Tumbleweeds stock price per
share of $1.35. SoundView compared Valicerts common stock price implied by the median premiums paid for the targets stock price in the precedent transactions one day, one month, three months and six months prior to announcement. The
median premiums paid were 41.3%, 62.1%, 42.0% and 9.5%, respectively. 

SoundView observed that based upon the median premiums paid in the precedent transactions, and Valicerts historical stock price one day, one month, three months and six months prior to announcement, the implied
exchange ratio ranged between 0.235 and 0.552. 

Pro forma Merger Analysis 

SoundView analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger on the estimated financial results of Valicert for the quarters ending September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003. Based on information provided by Valicerts management,
Valicerts estimated operating results were adjusted to reflect certain accounting rules which limit the recognition of deferred revenues pro forma for the merger. In addition, the analysis included certain reductions in certain Valicert
operating expenses which Valicert management believed would not continue on a pro forma basis. 

SoundView observed that, excluding the impact of transaction costs, goodwill impairment, non-recurring items, and the amortization of other tangibles and intangibles written-off in the acquisition, the
pro forma impact of the merger on Tumbleweeds estimated quarters ending September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003 earnings per share was accretive, based on an assumed closing date of June 30, 2003, excluding the effect of any revenue synergies
and cost savings from headcount reductions. 

These analyses were prepared solely for purposes of SoundView providing its opinion to the Valicert board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, and do not purport to be appraisals or
necessarily to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Valicert, SoundView or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast. As described above, SoundViews opinion to the Valicert board of directors was one of many factors considered by the board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger. The opinion should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Valicert board of directors or management with respect to the merger consideration. 

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 23, 2002 as amended
May 24, 2002 and January 2, 2003, Valicert engaged SoundView to render its financial opinion in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement, Valicert paid SoundView a negotiated customary fee upon delivery of the
opinion and 



reimbursed SoundView for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees and disbursements of its counsel. Valicert has agreed to
indemnify SoundView for certain liabilities that may arise out of the rendering of this opinion, including liabilities under the securities laws. SoundView also, from time to time, may in the future seek to perform certain financial advisory
services for Valicert or Tumbleweed for which SoundView may receive a fee. In the ordinary course of business, SoundView may in the future publish research on Valicert or Tumbleweed, make a market in their common stock and, in connection with its
market making activities, trade the securities of Valicert or Tumbleweed for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a short or long position in such securities. 

Tumbleweed Board of Directors 

Upon the closing of the merger, Tumbleweed and Valicert agreed that necessary corporate action would be taken to appoint an additional director would to serve on Tumbleweeds board of directors subject to the approval of the
respective boards of directors of Tumbleweed and Valicert. Tumbleweed is required to take all necessary corporate action required to appoint the director to its board of directors upon the closing of the merger. 

Interests of Persons in the Merger 

In considering the recommendations of the Valicert board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it, stockholders should be aware that certain members of the management of Valicert and
the Valicert board of directors have certain interests in the merger that are in addition to, or different from, the interests of stockholders of Valicert.

Ownership Related Interests 

August Capital L.P. and related parties own approximately an 8% interest in Valicert. David F. Marquardt, a member of the Tumbleweed
board of directors, is a founding general partner of August Capital L.P. Mr. Marquardt was excluded from a special committee of the Tumbleweed board of directors that reviewed and evaluated the merger with Valicert. Mr. John Johnston, a member
of the Valicert board of directors, is a general partner of August Capital L.P. 

Indemnification Agreements 

The merger agreement provides that Tumbleweed will indemnify, at all times after the effective time, directors and officers of Valicert or its subsidiaries from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the same extent as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification agreements existing as of the date of the merger agreement. In addition, from
and after the time the merger becomes effective, directors and officers of Valicert who become directors or officers of Tumbleweed will be entitled to the same indemnification rights and directors and officers liability insurance as are
provided to other directors and officers of Tumbleweed. The merger agreement also provides that Tumbleweed also agrees to maintain for at least six years after the effective time of the merger directors and officers liability insurance
policies on substantially the same terms and conditions as Valicerts insurance policies in effect on February 18, 2003, with respect to events occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that Tumbleweed may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions, taken as a whole, that are materially no less advantageous; provided further that in no event shall Parent be required to maintain coverage in an amount greater than
the amount agreed upon by Tumbleweed and Valicert in the merger agreement. 

Appraisal Rights for Valicert Stockholders 

Delaware 

The
Delaware General Corporation Law grants appraisal rights in the merger to the holders of Valicert common stock who object to the merger and follow certain procedures. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Valicert stockholders may object to
the merger and demand in writing that Valicert pay the fair value of their shares. Fair value takes into account all relevant factors, but excludes any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the merger. Stockholders who elect to exercise
appraisal rights must strictly comply with all of the applicable procedures to preserve those rights. These procedures are set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which is set forth in Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. 

Failure to comply with the
procedures set forth in Section 262 may cause a stockholder to lose its appraisal right. The following summary of appraisal rights and the related procedures is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Section 262, which you should review for
a complete description of the procedures. Valicert will not give any notice to its stockholders relating to appraisal rights other than as described in this document and required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

A stockholder who perfects his or her stockholders
appraisal rights, if any, under the Delaware General Corporation Law will probably recognize gain or loss on the date of the merger in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and such stockholders adjusted tax
basis in Valicert common stock. 



For this purpose, although there is no authority to this effect directly on point, the amount realized will likely be determined with
reference to the trading value of the shares on the date of the merger. Ordinary interest income and/or capital gain (capital loss), assuming that Valicert common stock was held as capital assets, should be recognized by such stockholder at the time
of actual receipt of payment, to the extent that such payment exceeds (or is less than) the amount realized on the date of the merger. 

California 

Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code makes certain portions of the California Corporations Code applicable, with limited
exceptions, to a foreign corporation with more than half of its business conducted in the state and stockholdings held in the state, irrespective of the corporations state of incorporation. Valicert may be subject to Section 2115 of the
California Corporations Code. If so, Section 2115 invokes the application of Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code to the merger with respect to our stockholders who elect to exercise dissenters rights. Therefore, dissenters
rights under California law may also be applicable to Valicert stockholders. Stockholders who properly perfect appraisal rights or dissenters rights and who do not subsequently withdraw such appraisal rights or dissenters rights will not
be entitled to surrender their shares of our common stock for payment in the manner otherwise provided in the merger agreement and described in this proxy statement. 

California law provides that stockholders may be entitled to receive cash equal to the fair market value of
their Valicert common stock. Stockholders who elect to exercise dissenters rights must comply with all of the procedures to preserve those rights. 

Chapter 13 sets forth the required procedure a stockholder exercising dissenters rights must follow. Making sure that you actually
perfect your dissenters rights can be complicated. The procedural rules are specific and must be followed completely. Failure to comply with the procedure may cause a termination of your dissenters rights, We are providing you with only
a summary of your rights and the procedure. The following information is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Chapter 13, a copy of which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please review Chapter 13 for the
complete procedure. Neither Tumbleweed nor Valicert will give you any notice other than as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and as required by the California Corporations Code. 

Shares of Valicert common stock must satisfy each of the
following requirements to qualify as dissenting shares under the California Corporations Code: (i) the shares must have been outstanding on the record date for the determination of the holders of Valicert common stock entitled to vote on the merger
(and therefore options to purchase Valicert common stock exercised after the record date may not constitute dissenting shares); (ii) the shares must not have been voted in favor of the merger; (iii) the holder of such shares must make a written
demand that Valicert repurchase the shares at fair market value and such demand must be received by Valicert within 30 days after notice of approval of the merger by the outstanding shares is mailed to the holder; and (iv) the holder of such
shares must submit certificates for endorsement (as described below). A vote by proxy or in person against the merger does not in and of itself constitute a demand for appraisal under the California Corporations Code. 

Pursuant to Sections 1300 through 1312 of the California
Corporations Code, holders of dissenting shares may require Valicert to repurchase their dissenting shares at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares determined as of the day before the first announcement of the terms of the merger,
excluding any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed merger, but adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split or stock dividend which becomes effective thereafter. 

Within 10 days following approval of the merger by the
stockholders of Valicert, Valicert is required to mail each person who did not vote in favor of the merger a notice of the approval of the merger, a statement of the price determined by Valicert to represent the fair market value of dissenting
shares determined as of the day before the first announcement of the terms of the merger (which shall constitute an offer by Valicert to purchase such dissenting shares at such stated price), a copy of sections 1300 through 1304 of the California
Corporations Code, and a description of the procedures for such holders to exercise their rights as dissenting stockholders. 



A stockholder who perfects his or her stockholders appraisal rights, if any, under
the California Corporation Code will probably recognize gain or loss on the date of the merger in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and such stockholders adjusted tax basis in Valicert common stock. For
this purpose, although there is no authority to this effect directly on point, the amount realized will likely be determined with reference to the trading value of the shares on the date of the merger. Ordinary interest income and/or capital gain
(capital loss), assuming that Valicert common stock was held as capital assets, should be recognized by such stockholder at the time of actual receipt of payment, to the extent that such payment exceeds (or is less than) the amount realized on the
date of the merger. 

Appraisal Rights Procedures for Valicert Stockholders 

Delaware 

If you are a Valicert stockholder and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 262 requires, in part, the following: 

1.    
Written Demand for
Appraisal.
    You must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Valicert before the vote is taken at the special meeting. The written demand must be separate and apart from any vote against the merger. 

2.    
Refrain from Voting for Approval
of the Merger.
    You must not vote for approval of the merger agreement. If you vote in favor of the merger agreement, your right to appraisal will terminate, even if you previously submitted a written demand for appraisal.

3.    
Continuously Hold
Valicert Shares.    
You must continuously hold your shares of Valicert stock from the date you make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger. 

(a)  A written demand for appraisal of Valicert stock is only effective if it is
delivered by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns such shares at the time the demand is made. The demand must be signed as the stockholders name appears on its stock certificate(s). If you are the beneficial owner of Valicert stock but
not the stockholder of record, you must have the stockholder of record deliver a written demand for appraisal. 

(b)  If you own Valicert stock in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee, guardian or custodian, you must
disclose the fact that you are delivering the demand for appraisal in that capacity. 

(i)  If you own Valicert stock with more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the
demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of all record owners. An authorized agent, which could include one or more of the joint owners, may deliver the demand for appraisal for the stockholder of record; however, the agent must expressly
identify the stockholders of record and state that the agent is delivering the demand as agent for these stockholders. 

(ii)  If you are a record owner, such as a broker, who holds Valicert stock as a nominee for others, you may
exercise a right of appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising such right for other beneficial owners. In such a case, you should specify in the written demand the number of shares as to which
you wish to demand appraisal and clearly identify the beneficial owners for whom you are demanding appraisal. If you do not expressly specify the number of shares, Valicert will assume that your written demand covers all the shares that are held in
your name. 

(iii)  You
should address the written demand to Valicert, 1215 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, California 94043, Attention: Timothy Conley, Chief Financial Officer. It is important that Valicert receive all written demands before the vote concerning the
merger agreement is taken. As explained above, this written demand should be delivered by, or on behalf of, the stockholder of record. It should specify the stockholders name and mailing address, the number of shares of stock owned, and that
the stockholder is demanding appraisal of such stockholders shares. 



(iv)  If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the
merger becomes effective, you will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. 

4.    
Written Notice.
    Within 10 days after the closing of the merger, Tumbleweed must
give written notice that the merger has become effective to each Valicert stockholder who has fully complied with the requirements of Section 262. 

5.    
Petition in the Chancery Court.    
Within 120 days after the closing of the merger,
either Tumbleweed or any Valicert stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This petition should request that the chancery court determine the value of the shares of
Valicert stock held by all of the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. If you intend to exercise your rights of appraisal, you should expect to file such a petition in the chancery court. Tumbleweed has no intention at this time to
file such a petition. Because Tumbleweed has no obligation to file such a petition upon the merger, if no dissenting stockholder files such a petition within 120 days after the closing, all dissenting stockholders will lose their rights of appraisal
and receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. 

6.    
Withdrawal of Demand.
    If you change your mind and decide you no longer want appraisal rights, you may withdraw your demand for appraisal at any
time within 60 days after the closing of the merger. You may also withdraw your demand for appraisal more than 60 days after the closing of the merger, but only with Tumbleweeds written consent. If you effectively withdraw your demand for
appraisal, you will receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. 

7.    
Request for Appraisal Rights Statement.
    If you have complied with the conditions of Section 262, you will be entitled to receive a statement from
Tumbleweed that sets forth the number of shares that have demanded appraisal and the number of stockholders who own those shares. In order to receive this statement, you must send a written request to Tumbleweed within 120 days after the closing of
the merger. Tumbleweed must mail the statement within 10 days after it receives the request. 

8.    
Chancery Court Procedures.
    If you or another stockholder properly files a petition for appraisal in the chancery court and delivers a copy to
Tumbleweed, Tumbleweed will then have 20 days to provide the chancery court with a list of names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal rights and have not reached an agreement with Tumbleweed as to the value of their shares.
The chancery court will then send notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of the petition to Tumbleweed and all of the stockholders in the list submitted to the chancery court. If the chancery court decides it is appropriate, it has the
power to conduct a hearing to determine whether the stockholders have fully complied with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether they are entitled to appraisal rights under that section. The chancery court may also require a
dissenting stockholder to submit his or her stock certificate(s) to the Registry in Chancery so that it can note on the certificate(s) that an appraisal is pending. If you do not follow the chancery courts directions, you may be dismissed from
the proceeding. 

9.    
Appraisal of Chancery Shares.
    After the chancery court determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights, the chancery court will appraise the shares. To determine
the fair value of the shares, the chancery court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation or depreciation due to the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger. After the chancery court determines the fair value of the
shares, it will direct Tumbleweed to pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The chancery court can also direct Tumbleweed to pay interest, simple or compound, on that value if the chancery court determines that
interest is appropriate. In order to receive the fair value for your shares, you must surrender your Valicert stock certificates to Tumbleweed. 

The chancery court could determine that the fair value of the shares of stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger
consideration. In other words, if you exercise appraisal rights, you could receive less consideration than you would under the merger agreement. 



10.    
Costs and Expenses of Appraisal
Proceeding.
    The costs and expenses of the appraisal proceeding may be assessed against Tumbleweed and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding, as the chancery court deems equitable under the
circumstances. You can request that the chancery court determine the amount of interest, if any, Tumbleweed should pay on the value of stock owned by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. You may also request that the chancery court
allocate the expense of the appraisal action incurred by any stockholder pro rata against the value of all of the Valicert shares entitled to the appraisal. 

11.    
Loss of Stockholders Rights.    
If you demand appraisal, after the closing of
the merger you will not be entitled to: 

(a)  vote the shares of Valicert stock for which you have demanded appraisal; 

(b)  receive payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to such shares, except for dividends or
distributions, if any, that are payable to holders of record as of a record date prior to the effective time of the merger; or 

(c)  receive payment of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement. However, you can regain these
rights if no petition for an appraisal is filed within 120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to Tumbleweed a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and your acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the
closing of the merger or with the written consent of Tumbleweed. As explained above, these actions will also terminate your appraisal rights. An appraisal proceeding in the chancery court cannot be dismissed unless the chancery court approves. The
chancery court may condition its approval of dismissal upon any terms that it deems just. 

California 

Additionally, if you are a Valicert stockholder and exercise your appraisal rights, if any, under California law, you must comply with Sections 1300 through 1312 of the California Corporations Code. 

1.    
Written Demand for
Appraisal.
    Within 30 days following the date on which the notice of the approval of the merger was mailed, a holder of Valicert common stock who wishes to be paid the full cash value of his, her or its dissenting shares
must submit a written demand and share certificates to Valicert. 

(a)  The written demand for the purchase of dissenting shares consists of: 

(i)  a statement concerning the number of dissenting shares held of record by such dissenting stockholder which
the dissenting stockholder demands that Valicert purchase; and 

(ii)  a statement of what such dissenting stockholder claims to be the fair market value of the dissenting shares as of the day before the announcement of the proposed merger (the statement
of fair market value constitutes an offer by the dissenting stockholder to sell the dissenting shares at such price). 

(b)  The stockholder must submit certificates representing any dissenting shares, which the dissenting
stockholder demands that Valicert purchase, so that such dissenting shares may either be stamped or endorsed with the statement that the shares are dissenting shares or exchanged for certificates of appropriate denomination so stamped or endorsed.

2.    
Refrain from Voting
for Approval of the Merger.
    You must not vote for approval of the merger agreement. If you vote in favor of the merger agreement, your right to appraisal will terminate. 

3.    
Continuously Hold Valicert
Shares.    
You must continuously hold your shares of Valicert stock from the date set by Valicert to identify stockholders eligible to vote to approve the merger agreement until you submit the share certificates to be
endorsed as dissenting shares. 

4.    
Agreement on Price.    
If Valicert and a dissenting stockholder agree upon the price to be paid for the dissenting shares, upon the dissenting stockholders surrender of the
certificates representing the dissenting shares, such price is required by law to be paid to the dissenting stockholder within the later of 30 days after such agreement or 30 days after any statutory or contractual conditions to the consummation of
the merger are satisfied or waived, subject to surrender of the certificates for the payment. 



5.    
Action in California Superior
Court.    
If Valicert and a dissenting stockholder disagree as to the price for such dissenting shares or disagree as to whether such dissenting shares are entitled to be classified as dissenting shares, such holder has the
right to bring an action in California Superior Court to resolve such dispute within six months after the date on which notice of approval of the merger is mailed. In such action, the court will determine whether the shares of Valicert common stock
held by such stockholder are dissenting shares, the fair market value of such shares of Valicert common stock, or both. 

6.    
Withdrawal of Demand.    
The California Corporations Code provides, among other
things, that a Valicert common stockholder may not withdraw the demand for payment of the fair market value of dissenting shares unless Valicert consents to such request for withdrawal. 

If you fail to comply strictly with these procedures you will lose your appraisal rights. Consequently, if
you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before you attempt to do so. 

For information about the special meeting of Valicert stockholders and how Valicert stockholders may vote at the special meeting of
Valicert stockholders, see The Stockholder Meetings. 

Tumbleweed stockholders are not entitled to exercise appraisal rights under applicable laws. 

Resale Restrictions 

All shares of Tumbleweed common stock received by Valicert stockholders in the merger will be freely transferable, except as follows: 



shares of Tumbleweed common stock received by persons who are deemed to be affiliates, as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, of
Valicert prior to the merger may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by the following: 



the resale provisions of Rule 145; 



Rule 144 in the case of those persons who become affiliates of Tumbleweed following the merger; or 



as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. 

Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Valicert or Tumbleweed generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with, that party and may include certain officers and directors of such party as well as principal stockholders of that party. In the merger agreement, Valicert has agreed to use reasonable efforts to cause each of its affiliates to execute
a written agreement restricting, consistent with the restrictions described above, the disposition by the affiliate of any shares of Tumbleweed common stock issued to the affiliate in the merger. 



Joseph (Yosi) Amram, August Capital L.P., Srinivasan (Chini) Krishnan and U.S. Venture Partners have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose
of their Tumbleweed common stock following the closing of the merger pursuant to the following terms: 



100% of the shares of Tumbleweed beneficially owned shall not be sold or otherwise disposed during the first 90 days following the closing of the merger;



50% of the share of Tumbleweed beneficially owned shall not be sold or otherwise disposed during the first 180 days following the closing of the merger;



all shares of Tumbleweed stock beneficially owned may be sold or otherwise disposed after the 180th day following the closing of the merger;





shares of Tumbleweed stock beneficially owned may be sold at anytime, and shall not be subject to the foregoing restrictions on transfer, for the following reasons:



shares are sold for the express purpose of paying for the exercise price of stock options exercised; and 



shares secure any loan granted to such stockholder by Valicert, which was paid off immediately prior to the closing of the merger. 

Stock Exchange Listing 

It is a condition to the merger that, upon consummation of the merger, the shares of Tumbleweed common stock to be issued by Tumbleweed in connection with the merger be approved for quotation on The Nasdaq National Market subject to
official notice of issuance. 

Delisting and Deregistration of Valicert Common Stock 

If the merger is consummated, the Valicert common stock will no longer meet the requirements for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Consequently, stockholders of Valicert will no longer be able to trade Valicert common stock on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. 

Treatment of Stock Certificates 

After the completion of the merger, each stock certificate previously representing shares of Valicert common stock will automatically, with no further action by the holder thereof, represent the right to receive 0.385 of a share of
Tumbleweed common stock for each share of Valicert common stock represented by the stock certificate. As promptly as practicable after the completion of the merger, Equiserve L.P., Tumbleweeds exchange agent, will mail a letter of transmittal
with instructions to each holder of record of Valicert common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger for use in exchanging, by book-entry transfer or otherwise, stock certificates formerly representing shares of Valicert
common stock for stock certificates representing shares of Tumbleweed common stock. No stock certificates should be surrendered by any holder of Valicert common stock until the holder has received the letter of transmittal and instructions from
Equiserve L.P. Tumbleweed stockholders will keep their current certificates as the merger does not require surrender of Tumbleweed stock certificates. 

Tax Treatment as a Reorganization 

It is intended by the parties that the merger be treated as a reorganization, that is, the holders of Valicert common stock that exchange all of their stock for Tumbleweed common stock will generally recognize no gain or loss in
connection with the merger for United States federal income tax purposes, except to the extent that cash is received in lieu of fractional shares of Tumbleweed common stock. Please refer to the section of this joint proxy/prospectus under the
heading Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences. 



THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

The section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus highlights selected information regarding the merger agreement and may not contain all the information that is important to you. We encourage you to read the entire merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, for a complete description of the merger agreement. In the event of any discrepancy between the terms of the
merger agreement and the following summary, the merger agreement will control. You should also review the other available information referred to in the section entitled Where You Can Find More Information on page 
187.

The Merger 

Valicert
will merge with Velocity Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tumbleweed, following: 



the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the related transactions by the Valicert stockholders; 



the approval of the issuance of Tumbleweed common stock in the merger and the relegated transactions by the Tumbleweed stockholders; 



the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Tumbleweed as the sole stockholder of Velocity Acquisition Sub, Inc.; and



the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger described below. 

Valicert will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tumbleweed at the
effective time of the merger. 

Effective Time 

At
the closing of the merger, the parties will cause the merger to become effective by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Tumbleweed and Valicert are working toward completing the merger as soon as
possible and hope to complete the merger by 
April     , 2003. 

Governing Charter Documents After the Merger 

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Velocity Acquisition Sub, Inc. will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Valicert, as the surviving corporation, at the effective time. 

Directors and Officers of Valicert and Tumbleweed After the Merger 

The directors and officers of Velocity Acquisition Sub, Inc. will become the directors and officers, respectively, of Valicert at the effective time of the merger. In addition, Tumbleweed has agreed to
appoint an additional director to Tumbleweeds board of directors designated by Valicert and approved by the boards of both Tumbleweed and Valicert, to serve on Tumbleweeds board of directors after the merger has closed. 

Conversion of Valicert Shares in the Merger 

At the effective time, each outstanding share of Valicert common stock will automatically be converted into .385 shares of Tumbleweed common stock. Stockholders of Valicert before the merger will own stock in Tumbleweed
after the merger unless they have duly exercised their appraisal rights. The number of shares of Tumbleweed common stock issuable in the merger will be proportionately adjusted as appropriate for any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with
respect to Valicert common stock or Tumbleweed common stock effected between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger. Within a year following the merger, Tumbleweed will merge Valicert directly into
Tumbleweed. 



No Fractional Shares 

No fractional shares of Tumbleweed common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead, Valicert stockholders will receive an amount of cash, in lieu of a fraction of a share of Tumbleweed common stock, equal to the
product of that fraction multiplied by the closing price for a share of Tumbleweed common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the closing date. 

Stock Transfer Books 

At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of Valicert shall be closed and there shall be no further registration or transfers of Valicert stock thereafter on Valicerts books. 

Valicert Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plans 

Tumbleweed has agreed to assume all outstanding options at the effective time of the merger, whether or not vested or exercisable under Valicerts 2001 Non-Statutory Stock Plan, 1998 Stock Plan,
1996 Equity Incentive Plan and Receipt.com Plan. Each option assumed by Tumbleweed will be subject to, and exercisable upon, the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Valicert option plan and the applicable option agreement issued
thereunder, except that: 



each assumed option will be exercisable for, and represent a right to acquire, the number of shares of Tumbleweed common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the number of shares of Valicert common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by .385; and 



the option price per share of Tumbleweed common stock subject to each assumed option will be an amount equal to the option price per share of Valicert common stock
subject to such option in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger divided by .385 (rounded up to the nearest full cent). 

Tumbleweed has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 that will register the Tumbleweed common stock subject to the assumed
Valicert stock options within 10 business days after the effective time of the merger. 

Valicert Stock Option Plans 

Tumbleweed also agreed to assume Valicerts 2001 Non-Statutory Stock Plan, 1998 Stock Plan and 1996 Equity Incentive Plan and intends to use such Valicert stock options plans to issue additional options after the merger.
Tumbleweed and Valicert have agreed that the Valicert stock option plans assumed by Tumbleweed will be amended to conform with Tumbleweed stock option plans. This will provide Tumbleweed with the flexibility to issue additional options as needed and
promote uniformity in new options issued to Valicert and Tumbleweed employees after the merger. Specifically, Valicert has agreed to amend its 2001 Non-Statutory Stock Plan, 1998 Stock Plan and 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, including the forms of
option agreements under each such plan, prior to the closing of the merger, to conform the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under such plans to the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under Tumbleweeds 1999
Omnibus Incentive Plan, including the form of option agreement under such plan. 

In addition to conforming the terms of the Valicert stock option plans assumed by Tumbleweed to Tumbleweeds stock option plan, Valicert agreed to amend further their 1998 Stock Plan prior to the
closing of the merger to provide the following: 



the number of shares of Valicert common stock available for grant under the 1998 Stock Plan immediately following the closing of the merger shall be no less than
1.5 million shares of Valicert common stock; and 





the provision of the 1998 Stock Plan that provides for an annual increase in the number of shares subject to options available to be granted under such plan shall be
calculated as a percentage of the number of Tumbleweed shares issued and outstanding rather than the number of Valicert share issued and outstanding. 

New Options for Continuing Employees of Valicert 

Tumbleweed expects that the agreed upon amendments to the Valicert stock option plans should provide the flexibility and resources needed to compensate and create incentives for employees of Valicert
and any of its parent or subsidiaries that continue as employees after the merger. If these amendments to the Valicert stock option plans result in a sufficient number of options available to be granted under the Valicert stock option plans assumed
by Tumbleweed, Tumbleweed expects to grant new options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of Tumbleweed stock to Valicert employees that continue as employees after the merger. In addition, if Valicert does not grant new options to purchase 689,000
shares of Valicert common stock to Valicert employees prior to the merger, as currently contemplated, Tumbleweed expects to grant new options to purchase a comparable number of options to purchase Tumbleweed stock after the closing of the merger,
after giving effect to the exchange ratio. Any such new options granted by Tumbleweed, however, will only be granted if sufficient options are available to be granted under the Valicert stock option plans assumed by Tumbleweed, according to the
terms of the merger agreement. Tumbleweed will not be obligated to grant new options to Valicert employees that continue as employees after the merger from Tumbleweed stock option plans in effect on or after the closing of the merger other than the
Valicert stock option plans assumed in the merger. 

Valicert Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

As of a date prior to the closing of the merger, Valicert shall terminate all offering and purchase periods in progress under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and shall provide that no new offering or purchase period
shall be commenced under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

Valicert Warrants 

At
the effective time of the merger, each warrant to acquire Valicert common stock that does not terminate by its terms at or prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into a warrant to acquire Tumbleweed common stock. Each warrant
converted in connection with the merger will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of that warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that: 



each warrant will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Tumbleweed common stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the number of shares
of Valicert common stock that were issuable upon exercise of that warrant prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by .385; and 



the exercise price per share of Tumbleweed common stock issuable upon exercise of each assumed warrant will be equal to the exercise price per share at which that
warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the merger divided by .385, rounded upward to the nearest whole cent. 

The Exchange Agent 

At or promptly after the effective time of the merger, Tumbleweed will be required to deposit with Equiserve L.P. certificates representing the shares of Tumbleweed common stock to be exchanged for shares of Valicert common stock and
cash to pay for fractional shares and any dividends or distributions that holders of Valicert common stock may be entitled to receive under the merger agreement. 



Exchange of Valicert Stock Certificates for Tumbleweed Stock Certificates 

As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to Valicert stockholders a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering Valicert stock certificates in exchange for Tumbleweed stock certificates and cash in lieu of fractional shares. VALICERT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR EXCHANGE UNTIL THEY
HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND INSTRUCTIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE. 

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares 

Valicert stockholders will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on Tumbleweed common stock with a record date after the merger is completed until they have surrendered their
Valicert stock certificates in exchange for Tumbleweed stock certificates. No cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be made to a holder of unsurrendered Valicert stock certificates. If there is any dividend or other distribution on
Tumbleweed common stock with a record date after the completion of the merger, former Valicert stockholders will receive, following surrender of their Valicert stock certificates to the exchange agent, the dividend or other distribution payable with
respect to the shares of Tumbleweed common stock issued in exchange for their Valicert common stock. 

Directors and Officers 

The directors and officers of Velocity Acquisition Sub at the effective time of the merger will be the directors and officers of the surviving corporation. 

Representations and Warranties 

The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Valicert and its subsidiaries, subject to qualifications in the merger agreement, relating to the following matters: 



organization, good standing, qualification to do business and similar corporate matters; 



capital structure;

The agreements related to the conduct of Valicerts and

and Section 5.2 of the merger agreement entitled Interim Operations of Parent. 

No Solicitation of Transactions 

The merger agreement provides that neither Valicert nor any of its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, may solicit, initiate or encourage, including by furnishing information, or take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or proposals relating to an alternative transaction described below, or participate in any negotiations regarding an alternative transaction. The merger agreement defines an alternative transaction to mean: 



a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire more than 30% of the outstanding shares of Valicert common stock; 





any acquisition or proposed acquisition of Valicert or any of its significant subsidiaries by a merger or other business combination, regardless of whether Valicert
or any of its subsidiaries survives the merger; or 



any other transaction the consummation of which a third party would acquire control of assets of Valicert or any of its subsidiaries, including the equity securities
of such subsidiaries, for consideration equal to 30% or more of the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Valicert common stock. 

The merger agreement provides that these restrictions will not prohibit Valicert, prior to the approval of the merger by its stockholders,
from: 



complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with regard to a bona fide tender offer or exchange offer, which
rules require a target company to respond publicly to a tender offer; or 



participating in negotiations or furnishing information in response to an unsolicited proposal for an alternative transaction if all of the following conditions are
met: 



the Valicert board of directors must have concluded in good faith, after consulting its outside legal counsel, that it must participate in such negotiations or
furnish such information in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders; and 



the board of directors must promptly advise Tumbleweed orally and in writing of any request for information or of any proposal in connection with an alternative
transaction, specifying the material terms and conditions of the request or proposal and the identity of the person making that request or proposal. 

Except as described below, neither the Valicert board of directors or a committee of the board shall:



withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Tumbleweed, its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger; 



approve or recommend an alternative transaction; or 



enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to an alternative transaction. 

However, if, prior to the approval of the merger by its
stockholders, the Valicert board of directors receives a superior proposal and, the board of directors concludes in good faith, after consulting its outside legal counsel, that it must take such actions in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders, the board may withdraw its recommendation or approval of the merger after the fifth business day following Tumbleweeds receipt of written notice, advising Tumbleweed of its intent to approve or recommend the superior
proposal. Upon receipt of such notice, Tumbleweed will have three business days to adjust the terms of the merger agreement to enable Valicert to proceed with its original recommendation to approve the merger and the merger agreement. Even if the
Valicert board withdraws its support for the merger with Tumbleweed due to a superior proposal, Valicert must hold a special meeting of its stockholders to allow them to vote on the merger with Tumbleweed. 

For purposes of this covenant, the term superior proposal
means any of the alternative transactions described in the definition above, which the Valicert board of directors concludes in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its financial advisor, to be more favorable to the stockholders of
Valicert than the merger taking into account all relevant factors. 

Stockholders Meeting 

In order to consummate the merger, both Tumbleweed and Valicert, acting through their respective boards of directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law, give notice of and convene a meeting of their respective 



stockholders, as soon as practicable after the registration statement is declared effective, for the purpose of considering and voting upon
the merger agreement and, in the case of Tumbleweed, the issuance of Tumbleweed common stock pursuant to the merger. 

Access to Information 

Subject to existing confidentiality obligations, Valicert and Tumbleweed have agreed to afford each other and their representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records. 

Indemnification and Insurance 

The merger agreement provides that Tumbleweed agrees to indemnify, at all times after the effective time, directors and officers of Valicert or its subsidiaries from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the merger to the same extent as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification agreements existing as of the date of the merger agreement, February 18, 2003. 

In addition, Tumbleweed also agrees to maintain for at least
six years after the effective time of the merger directors and officers liability insurance policies on the same terms and conditions as Valicerts insurance policies in effect on February 18, 2003, with respect to events occurring

shall Parent be required to maintain coverage in an amount greater than the amount agreed upon by Tumbleweed and Valicert in the merger agreement.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Valicert stockholders that exchange Valicert common stock for Tumbleweed common stock pursuant to the
merger. This summary addresses only stockholders who hold their Valicert stock as a capital asset and will hold Tumbleweed stock received in exchange therefor as a capital asset. This does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations that
may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders that are subject to special rules, such as, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, dealers in securities,
foreign stockholders, stockholders owning stock as part of a straddle, hedge or conversion transaction, or holders who acquired their stock as a result of the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation. The following summary
is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury regulations thereunder, judicial decisions and current administrative rulings, as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations,
possibly on a retroactive basis. Tax considerations under state, local, foreign, and other laws are not addressed herein. 
Accordingly, each stockholder is advised to consult his or her tax advisor as to the particular facts and circumstances
which may be unique to such stockholder and also as to any estate, gift, federal, state, local, foreign, or other tax considerations arising out of the merger.

No rulings have been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the
matters discussed herein. There can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions would not alter the tax consequences set forth below. It is a condition to the obligation of Tumbleweed to consummate
the merger that Tumbleweed receive an opinion from its counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, and it is a condition to the obligation of Valicert to consummate the merger that Valicert receive an opinion from its counsel, Gray Cary
Ware & Freidenrich LLP, in each case, substantially to the effect that, based upon certain facts, representations and assumptions, the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The conditions regarding the receipt of the opinions described in the preceding sentence will not be waived by Tumbleweed or Valicert after receipt of the Valicert stockholder approval unless further stockholder
approval is obtained with the appropriate disclosure. The issuance of the opinions is conditioned on, among other things, the receipt by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP, of representation letters
from each of Tumbleweed, Valicert and Velocity Acquisition Sub, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP. An opinion of counsel represents
counsels best legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court. The following summary assumes that the merger will be consummated as described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

Exchange of Valicert Common Stock for Tumbleweed Common Stock
.    A holder of Valicert common stock whose
shares of Valicert common stock are exchanged in the merger for Tumbleweed common stock will not recognize gain or loss, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share. The aggregate tax basis of Tumbleweed common stock
received by such holder will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the Valicert common stock for which it is exchanged (excluding any portion of the holders basis allocable to a fractional share), and the holding period of Tumbleweed common
stock received will include the holding period of the Valicert common stock for which it is exchanged. 

Cash In Lieu of Fractional Shares
.    The payment of cash to a Valicert stockholder instead of a fractional
share of Tumbleweed common stock generally will result in the recognition of capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax basis of Tumbleweed common stock allocable to that fractional
interest. 

Tax Consequences to Tumbleweed and
Valicert
.    No gain or loss will be recognized by Tumbleweed, Velocity Acquisition Sub, or Valicert solely as a result of the merger. 



ANTICIPATED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF MERGER 

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For purposes of preparing
Tumbleweeds financial statements, Tumbleweed will establish a new accounting basis for Valicerts assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, the merger consideration and the costs of the merger. Any excess of cost over the fair
value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of Valicert will be recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, 
Business Combinations
, and No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets
, goodwill is not subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Rather, goodwill is subject to at least annual assessment for impairment based on a fair value test. Identified intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized
over those lives. A final determination of the intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values,
has not yet been made. At the time of closing of the merger, Tumbleweed will determine the fair value of Valicerts assets and liabilities and will make appropriate business combination accounting adjustments. However, for purposes of
disclosing pro forma information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Tumbleweed has made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation, based upon current estimates and assumptions, which is subject to revision upon consummation
of the merger. 



TUMBLEWEED BUSINESS 

Overview 

Tumbleweed
is a leading provider of secure messaging applications for businesses and government organizations using the Internet. Tumbleweed enables businesses to share sensitive information via e-mail with customers, business partners, and suppliers,
transforming e-mail into a tool for enhancing communication and increasing productivity. By deploying our secure messaging solutions, businesses improve their ability to enhance customer service, automate traditional paper and voice-based processes,
enable secure collaboration with partners, comply with government and company policies to limit liability, enhance employee productivity, and prevent network disruption. 

Tumbleweeds suite of secure messaging products provide solutions to important productivity, customer
service and online security needs. By deploying some or all of our solutions, our customers can: 



defend their top line against competitors by expanding their existing e-channel to include secure e-mail customer service applications; 



improve their bottom line by moving expensive paper-and phone-based processes online; 



improve communications with partners, while at the same time protecting valuable intellectual property through secure collaborative partner networks;



improve the organizations liability by ensuring that internal and customer communications comply with company, human resources, or government regulations,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA; and 



reduce network congestion as well as enhance employee productivity by keeping spam and e-mail viruses out of the enterprise network. 

Industry Background 

The use of corporate e-mail systems, customer service applications and web services has grown as enterprises are increasingly relying on these applications to communicate with their customers, business partners and suppliers.
Enterprises are looking for communications applications that can integrate and migrate business processes and associated data with e-mail and web applications and transform how they communicate and conduct business with their customers and partners.
The volume of corporate e-mail communications has grown significantly over the past several years in both the business and consumer markets. 

To fully leverage the power of communicating using the Internet and email, businesses must first address the issues of security,
centralized management, automation, legacy integration and end-user behavior, as well as potential adoption issues. The use of policies and management protocols that were traditionally applied to paper or voice-based processes within a company in
many cases are appropriately applied to communications conducted over e-mail. The adoption of these policies and protocols is critical to establish adherence to regulatory requirements that face each industry and to provide enterprises with the same
protection of audit trail and confidentiality that paper processes supply. In addition, recent studies from Gartner Group indicate that consumers are hesitant about doing business online unless they can have confidence that the security and the
privacy of their information is protected. End-users are also interested in easily accessible online services and communications from the companies with which they do business. 

With comprehensive security solutions, businesses can deploy policies enterprise-wide, provide critical
management of communications, and leverage the investment they have made in their existing systems in order to fully maximize business conducted on the Internet.

Tumbleweeds protection solutions enable companies to centrally control, manage and monitor their Internet communications stream. By controlling and monitoring groupware and browser-based communications our customers
can better comply with their own internal corporate policies as well as government regulations. Our solutions combine not only all of the elements required to establish and manage communications policies but also allow for virus and spam protection,
archival of critical communications and regulatory compliance. 

Every day, high volumes of e-mail messages flow in and out of businesses carrying intellectual property assets (such as business plans, technology and engineering specifications, and contracts), personal communications, and harmful
content such as viruses and spam. By neglecting to monitor and manage this communications stream, businesses risk: 



interception of valuable business data by competitors or hackers; 



loss of data and productivity from damage by viruses and malicious content; 



clogging of network bandwidth by spam and recreational multimedia files; 



liability for accidental exposure of confidential customer or employee information; 



liability for exposure to racist, sexist, or otherwise harmful content in spam or employee distributed messages; and 



liability for violation of industry regulations including various healthcare or other government regulations. 

Businesses need to monitor and manage their communications so
that groupware applications can continue to be a tool for fast, cost-effective communications. They need to centrally manage and globally enforce communications policies. They need a solution that complements, rather than replaces, their groupware
infrastructure. They also need a solution that enforces communication controls automatically, without relying on the initiative or costly re-training of individual users within their organization. 

By integrating Tumbleweeds protection solutions with
existing groupware networks, a business can significantly enhance control of its online communications and set policies to apply content control, spam protection, filtering, encryption, access control, attachment management, virus scanning and
digital signatures to groupware traffic. Because our solutions allow policies to be administered centrally and enforced universally across an enterprise, our server-based protection solutions offer several advantages over desktop solutions,
including: 



rapid deployment (typically installed, configured, and tuned within a week); 



universal coverage (all groupware and web-based e-mail communications are automatically managed, so no change in existing infrastructure needs to be made);



centralized policy enforcement (identification of sensitive digital information, including the use of industry-specific lexicons); 





cost-effective centralized administration (no expenses for end user training or distributing, installing, or maintaining new desktop software).

Our protection solutions include
Tumbleweed Secure Mail and Tumbleweed Secure Archive: 



Tumbleweed Secure Mail allows enterprises to apply policy to inbound and outbound groupware communications. It includes the Secure Policy Gateway for centralized
policy enforcement, anti-virus scanning capabilities and a suite of process managers and optional applications that can be quickly configured to define and enforce the policies appropriate to a particular business. The Secure Mail Content Manager
scans messages and attachments for specific words or strings of words. When a policy violation is detected, Tumbleweed Secure Mail can take a number of actions, such as block, quarantine, archive, or defer delivery. With Secure Mail Access Manager,
companies can set policies that restrict access of groupware-originated communications from certain senders or those sent to certain recipients. For example, policies can block inbound messages from known problem or spam domains, or prevent
confidential information from being sent to an unwanted domain. The Secure Mail Virus Manager uses integrated server-based anti-virus software from Network Associates to detect and optionally clean or strip infected attachments in both incoming and
outgoing messages. 



Tumbleweed Secure Archive allows organizations to archive all or selected simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) messages to an external device, such as an
optical jukebox. Messages can be tagged with information such as violation type and retention period prior to archiving. Tumbleweed Secure Archive provides Web-based reviewer tools for performing queries and running reports.

Tumbleweed Solutions to Extend Enterprise Networks 

Tumbleweeds extension solutions allow businesses and organizations to establish secure Internet communications channels with partners, suppliers and customers. All of Tumbleweeds extension
solutions are server-based and integrate with existing groupware networks, enterprise systems, or legacy applications in order to secure communications automatically before it crosses the corporate firewall. Without retraining users or changing
desktop software, our extension solutions enable businesses to take advantage of moving their business communications online and ensure that those communications are encrypted, auditable and controlled so that access is granted only to appropriate
recipients. 

Tumbleweeds extension
solutions include Tumbleweed Secure Public Network, or SPN, Tumbleweed Secure Redirect, Tumbleweed Secure Messenger, and Tumbleweed Secure Statements. 



Tumbleweed SPN allows businesses to leverage the existing, public infrastructure of the Internet to communicate safely with their partners electronically in a
cost-effective manner. A great deal of business critical communicationssuch as business plans, contracts, product drawings, artwork, legal documents and engineering specificationstake place among branch offices, between branch offices
and headquarters or among businesses and their long-standing partners and customers. Until now, businesses have not had a cost-effective solution for securing and automating these communications. Courier services, such as FedEx, are relatively
secure, but much slower and more expensive than electronic communications. Virtual Private Networks, or VPN, typically involve the installation and maintenance of custom hardware and software. Also, VPN access can be difficult to administer for both
remote offices and outside partners that need to access only certain information but not the business entire network environment. 



Using
groupware applications and e-mail is fast and convenient, but typically not secure and can be difficult to manage and track. Using e-mail as a main communications vehicle can also open a company to risks involved with exposing important confidential
information to competitors and hackers. Businesses need a way to secure these communicationsquickly, easily, and automatically. The solution should: 



complement rather than replace existing groupware applications and IT systems at each site; 



be based on open standards, so that it works with whatever software and hardware a particular partner is using; and 



apply security automatically at the server level, without requiring end users to learn new procedures or replace the client software they are already familiar with.

By deploying our Tumbleweed SPN
solution, a business can create secure networks among its offices, partners, suppliers, and customers. Meanwhile, end users within and outside the company can continue using their own client software. Tumbleweed SPN is a server-based solution that
can automatically encrypt outgoing messages and sign them with an organizations digital certificate. The solution also monitors, authenticates, and decrypts incoming messages, and delivers them unencrypted to the recipients desktop
within the corporate network environment. Security applied is automatic and transparent to employees within the organizations. 



Tumbleweed Secure Redirect allows enterprises to communicate securely with individuals at locations outside the secure public network of partners and/or remote
offices. Tumbleweed Secure Redirect can scan the content of outgoing messages originating from groupware applications or web-based email applications and then encrypt those communications for delivery depending upon a companys policies.
Recipients of messages only need an e-mail program and a web browser to receive encrypted messages. Recipients can be authenticated by a variety of methods, using known information about the recipient or by tying into an internal authentication
database or engine existing within the company (lightweight directory access protocol, or LDAD, directory, single sign-on directory, etc.). Tumbleweed Secure Redirect enables businesses to automatically encrypt, deliver, and track communications to
any Internet user with a standard email program and web connection. The advantages of Tumbleweed Secure Redirect include: 



universal coverage and ubiquitous reach (all groupware communications can be automatically managed and secured, any e-mail client and/or web browser can accept the
encrypted messages); 



expedited training (end users need not learn new procedures or new software tools); and 



cost-effective (no expenses for end user training or distributing, installing, or maintaining new desktop software). 



Tumbleweed Secure Redirect also allows enterprises to apply security to emails originating from an internal customer relationship management, or CRM, system.



Tumbleweed Secure Messenger supports secure ad hoc online customer service or everyday communications using the Tumbleweed Staging Server and private URL technology.
Secure Messenger is an application designed to enable secure, trackable online communication, including secure, browser-based, person-to-person communications. Combining Secure Messenger and Secure Redirect, enterprises can tie into existing CRM
applications and e-mail response systems to ensure that the confidentiality and security of messages delivered to customers is maintained. Using Tumbleweed Secure Messenger, Internet users can securely compose, send, receive, store and search
messages and files. Secure Messenger comes with the Tumbleweed Secure Inbox, an online e-mail inbox that contains all archived messages so customers can download and view messages at any time of the day and track responses of online customer service
inquiries. The Tumbleweed Secure Inbox is used to increase levels of customer service, as well as increase internal productivity by allowing customers to self-service using an online vehicle. Tumbleweed Secure Messenger can interoperate with a
businesss existing web portal applications creating a customized, branded experience for a business customers and /or partners. 





Tumbleweed Secure Statements offers businesses a foundation for the automated preparation, secure Internet delivery of, tracking of and managed response to
documents. Businesses send out very large quantities of paper documents each year. Secure Statements easily integrates with existing systems, and can automatically extract legacy data and convert print stream data (such as PCL, AFP, LCDS, HTML and
XML) into Internet-ready files, and deliver such files to the customer or partner. In addition, our solutions can automatically forward important communications to electronic archives. To receive a statement sent via Tumbleweed Secure Statements, an
end user only needs an email client and a web browser. New desktop software, Java applets or desktop plug-ins are not required. Electronic statements delivered by our solutions cost significantly less than paper statements because we eliminate
printing and postage costs. Using Tumbleweed Secure Messenger, Secure Redirect, and Secure Statements together, businesses can increase customer retention and service by aggregating all customer communications into one secure location for a
customer, organized in folders and by delivery dates and times. 

The advantages of using Tumbleweed Secure Statements versus traditional paper-based delivery and other electronic delivery methods include: 



cost reduction (no printing and mailing documents to customers); 



existing system integration (extracts statement information from business applications, databases, and mainframe print streams); 



universal delivery (reaches any Internet user with a standard email program and a Web browser); 



security and authentication (includes passwords, PINs, and digital certificates); 



thorough tracking (enables businesses to create an audit trail or otherwise track the transmission and receipt of statements); 



payment system integration (integrates with various payment engines with customization); and 



cost-effective deployment (no expenses for end user training or distributing, installing, or maintaining new desktop software).

Sales 

Tumbleweed
maintains a direct sales force that focuses on signing key enterprise customers as well as further penetrating existing accounts by selling them new applications. Our sales force consists of a total of 34 employees as of December 31, 2002.
Sales offices in the U.S. currently include Redwood City, California; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Reston, Virginia; and San Ramon, California. Our sales force includes field sales engineers and inside sales personnel who support the
account executives. Field sales engineers assist our account executives with technical presentations, customer requirements analysis and initial solution designs. Our inside sales personnel assist the account executives in managing their customer
relationships and qualifying new accounts. Our sales effort is augmented by the sales forces of our channel partners. The typical sales cycle can range from one to nine months, but may be significantly longer for large sales. 

Marketing 

Tumbleweeds marketing efforts are organized around three primary areas: product marketing, product management and corporate marketing. Product marketing identifies target markets and customer opportunities, then develops the
positioning, programs and materials to reach customers and support sales activities. Product management translates customer and market requirements into product plans and works with engineering to ensure completion. Product management also trains
salespeople on product information. Corporate marketing drives overall market awareness of Tumbleweed as a company and our products through analyst and investor relations, media, events, and speaking engagements. Corporate marketing is also
responsible for branding, corporate identity, and the Tumbleweed website. Both product marketing and corporate marketing work closely with direct sales and channel sales partners to focus programs more effectively and guide product research and
development. 

Governmental Regulation 

Tumbleweed is not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally, and laws or regulations directly applicable to access to online
commerce. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as
user privacy, Internet transaction taxation, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution and characteristics and quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more
stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. For example, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, could determine through one of its ongoing proceedings that the Internet
is subject to regulation. Among other possible courses of action, the FCC may determine that Internet service providers are subject to certain access charges or fees for carrying Internet traffic over the public switched telephone network. The
adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business, or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Permits or licenses may be required from federal, state, local or foreign governmental authorities to operate or to sell some products on the Internet. We may not be able to obtain these permits or
licenses. We may be required to comply with future national and/or international legislation and statutes regarding conducting commerce on the Internet in all or specific countries throughout the world. It may not be possible to comply with this
legislation or these statutes on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. 

In addition, Tumbleweeds products rely on encryption and authentication technology from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to achieve secure transmission of
confidential information. Exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the U.S. and various 



foreign governments. We have obtained approval to export products using up to 255-bit symmetric encryption and 2048-bit public key
encryption, including the products formerly known as IME Server, IME Desktop, IME Receive Applet, IME Remote API using OmniORB with SSL, and MMS Worldwide/255. We are not exporting other hardware, software or technology that is subject to export
control under U.S. law. However, the list of countries and products for which exports are restricted and the related regulatory policies could be revised in the future, and we may not be able to obtain required government approvals. 

Intellectual Property 

To date, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued Tumbleweed 12 U.S. patents11 utility patents and one design patent related to the user interface of Tumbleweeds products. We have filed an additional
22 utility patent applications that are now pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also have 23 patent applications now pending in foreign jurisdictions, including three pending applications filed under the Patent Cooperation
Treaty. In addition, we currently have nine registered trademarks worldwide, including the mark Tumbleweed, and are pursuing other key trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. 

Tumbleweed regards our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and
other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on patent and trademark law together with confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. Despite these
precautions, we may not be successful in protecting our rights. For example, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy particular portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as
proprietary. Some end-user license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights, particularly software based patents, to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and competing companies
may independently develop similar technology. In particular, we are currently engaged in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which may not be successful and in any event will result in substantial expenditures of resources to
pursue. 

The status of U.S. patent protection in
the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office grants additional patents and as the Federal Courts further interpret software-based inventions. The status of foreign protection in the software
industry is also evolving and not well-defined. Our patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. Our products may infringe patents issued to third parties. In addition, because foreign patent
applications are not published until 18 months after filing and patent applications in the U.S. are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, U.S. and/or foreign applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our
software products. 

Third parties could claim
infringement by Tumbleweed with respect to current or future products or services. We may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of their products and
services increasingly overlap with ours. We aggressively seek to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, which may further increase the risk of adverse claims. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming to
defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements attention and resources, limit use of our services or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. A successful claim of product infringement against us could harm our business
and prospects. 

Competition 

The
markets in which Tumbleweed competes are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. We believe there is no single competitor that offers the complete package of secure messaging applications that Tumbleweed sells. We are aware of competitors that
exist for each of our product lines and for combined components of our solution sets. 



Tumbleweeds principal competition for Tumbleweeds protection solutions are companies that offer various e-mail content filtering products. Companies that sell products that compete with some of the features within our
products include Clearswift Technologies, CipherTrust, Inc., and Trend Micro Incorporated. 

Tumbleweeds principal competition in the secure messaging and statement delivery market area comes from providers with offerings that are intended to compete directly with our products or that
could be used as alternatives to our products. Examples of some of these providers are PostX Corporation, Sigaba, and Zix Corporation. Our solutions can be an alternative to traditional mail and courier delivery services such as those offered by
Federal Express Corporation, UPS, or the U.S. Postal Service, and to general purpose e-mail applications and services. In addition, companies with which we do not presently directly compete may become competitors in the future, either through the
expansion of our products or through their product development in the area of secure online communication services. These companies include International Business Machines Corporation/Lotus Development Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation.

The principal competitive factors in
Tumbleweeds industry include price, product functionality, product integration, platform coverage and ability to scale, worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base. Additionally, some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or
improved products that may compete with product lines we market and distribute. We expect that the market for mission-critical messaging software, which has been fragmented historically, will become more consolidated with larger companies being
better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term. As this market continues to develop, a number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming
strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces, to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors, and to educate
potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than developing their own products. Competitors could introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products and could also
bundle existing or new products with other more established products that discourage users from purchasing our products. In addition, because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market, we expect additional competition from
other established and emerging companies. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. 

Employees 

As of
December 31, 2002, Tumbleweed employed 133 people worldwide, including 47 in engineering, 34 in sales, 25 in professional services, five in marketing, and 22 combined in corporate management, finance, human resources, information technology, legal,
and other administration. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Properties and Facilities 

Tumbleweed leases approximately 40,000 square feet for our corporate headquarters located in Redwood City, California under a lease with a term of five years commencing June 8, 1999. We also maintain domestic sales offices in
Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Reston, Virginia; and San Ramon, California. Other offices we maintain include Ann Arbor, Michigan, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 



Legal Proceedings 

On July 7, 2000, three complaints were filed by David H. Zimmer, Congressional Securities, Inc. and other plaintiffs against Interface Systems, Inc. (a company Tumbleweed acquired in 2000) and various additional defendants, including
Interfaces prior president and chief executive officer, Robert A. Nero, and Fiserv Correspondent Services, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The three complaints contained substantially similar
allegations of false and misleading representations by various defendants allegedly designed to inflate Interfaces stock price. The complaints sought relief under the federal securities laws on behalf of purported classes of persons who
purchased, held, or sold shares of Interface stock, and under various other causes of action. On July 27, 2001, the Court granted our motion to transfer the lawsuits to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, which, on
April 19, 2002, dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs class allegations and federal securities law claims that purportedly arose under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Also on April 19, 2002, plaintiffs filed a Second
Amended Consolidated Complaint that (i) consolidated the separate actions into one action, (ii) added certain new plaintiffs, (iii) withdrew Congressional Securities, Inc. as a plaintiff, and (iv) added claims for breach of fiduciary duty and
negligent misrepresentation, which are the sole remaining claims in the case. On May 20, 2002, we filed a motion to dismiss these claims, which motion has remained pending before the Court while the case has continued to proceed through the
discovery phase. The accompanying financial statements do not include a reserve for any costs for damages, if any, that might result from this uncertainty. We believe this consolidated action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against
it and seek its dismissal. 

An attorney issued a
press release on March 7, 2003 stating that he had filed a purported securities class action lawsuit, alleging the violation of federal and state securities laws, on behalf of persons who acquired the common stock of Tumbleweed (other than
purchasers of Tumbleweeds initial public offering) during the time period from August 6, 1999 to October 18, 2000, inclusive. According to the press release, the lead plaintiff in this purported class action lawsuit is a person whose deceased
husband purchased approximately 2,700 shares of securities of Commerce One, Inc. In addition, the press release states that this purported class action lawsuit names Tumbleweed Communications Corp. as a defendant, along with Jeffrey C. Smith and
Joseph C. Consul (who served as Tumbleweeds CEO and CFO, respectively, during that time period). We have not been served with a summons or a complaint with respect to this purported securities class action lawsuit. 

Although Tumbleweed believes these lawsuits are without merit,
no assurance can be given about their outcome, and an adverse outcome could significantly harm our business and operating results. Moreover, the costs in defending the lawsuits could harm future operating results. 

In May 2002, Tumbleweed sued PayPal, Inc. alleging
infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 5,790,790 and our U.S. Patent No. 6,192,407. In May 2002 PayPal filed an answer and counterclaims denying our allegations and seeking declarations from the court that our patents are not infringed and are
invalid. In September 2002, we filed a First Amended Complaint that added eBay, Inc. as a defendant. Both PayPal and eBay filed an answer and counterclaims to the First Amended Complaint denying our allegations and seeking declarations from the
court that our patents are not infringed and are invalid. In January 2003, we filed a Second Amended Complaint that added a cause of action against each of PayPal and eBay for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,487,599, which the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office granted to us after we had filed the First Amended Complaint. Both PayPal and eBay filed an answer and counterclaims to the Second Amended Complaint denying our allegations and seeking declarations from the court that our patents
are not infringed and are invalid. The litigation is proceeding and is currently in the claim construction phase. 

In September 2002, Tumbleweed received a letter from Entrust, Inc. indicating that we may be interested in licensing the technology
covered by U.S. Patent No. 6,393,568, Encryption and Decryption System and Method with Content Analysis Provision, issued to Entrust. In October 2002, we sent a letter to Entrust indicating that Entrust may be interested in licensing the technology
covered by four patents issued to Tumbleweed, namely, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,061,448, Method & System For Dynamic Server Document Encryption, 6,119,137, 



Distributed Dynamic Document Conversion Server, 6,151,675, Method & Apparatus For Effecting Secure Document Format Conversion, and
6,470,086, Method & Apparatus For Effecting Secure Document Format Conversion. In February 2003, we received a letter from Entrust indicating that we may have an interest in three additional patents issued to Entrust: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,229,894,
Method and Apparatus for Access to User-Specific Encryption Information, 6,256,733, Access and Storage of Secure Group Communication Cryptographic Keys, and 6,266,420, Method and Apparatus for Secure Group Communications. 

Tumbleweed believes we do not infringe any valid Entrust
patent. If we were to conclude based on additional information that some element of our processes are or might be covered by a valid Entrust patent, we might seek to negotiate and obtain a license from Entrust. If we were unwilling or unable to
obtain a license from Entrust, we would remain subject to potential liability for patent infringement. Although we will contest any lawsuit by Entrust vigorously, we cannot make assurances that we will prevail if Entrust were to sue us for
infringement of any of the Entrust patents. If any portions of our products were found to be infringing a valid Entrust patent, then we would likely be unable to continue to offer those portions of our products found to be infringing. We could also
then be required to pay damages for past infringing use, possibly attorneys fees, and possibly treble damages. This could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

In September 2002, Tumbleweed sued Yahoo!, Inc.,
Yahoo, alleging infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 5,790,790 and our U.S. Patent No. 6,192,407. In January 2003, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, we filed a First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for infringement of an
additional patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,487,599, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted to us after we had filed the original complaint, and to specifically allege that Yahoo had infringed and continues to infringe the asserted patents
with its online financial service known as PayDirect. Yahoo filed an answer and counterclaims to the First Amended Complaint denying our allegations and seeking declarations from the court that our patents are not infringed and are invalid. In
February 2003, we filed a motion seeking leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, naming HSBC Bank USA as a co-defendant, on the grounds that HSBC Bank USA and Yahoo are commercial partners in the accused online financial service, which they have
jointly marketed as Yahoo!PayDirect with HSBC. 

In October 2002, Tumbleweed sued E*Trade, Inc. alleging infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,192,407. In December 2002, before the defendant had filed an answer to our complaint, two of its service providers agreed to pay us on
behalf of the defendant a significant initial amount and a royalty of four cents per delivery of electronic information using a personalized, trackable URL (as covered in the claims of our patent). After the initial payment was made, we dismissed
the lawsuit. 

In February 2003, Tumbleweed sued
Ticketmaster alleging infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 5,790,790, our U.S. Patent No. 6,192,407, and our U.S. Patent No. 6,487,599. This litigation is in its preliminary phases. 

In February 2003, Tumbleweed sued Ameritrade, Inc. alleging infringement of our U.S. Patent
No. 6,192,407. In March 2003, we filed a First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for infringement of an additional patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,529,956, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted to us after we had filed the
original complaint. This litigation is in its preliminary phases.

 (SFAS 142), on January 1, 2002. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, Tumbleweed recorded a
transitional impairment loss of $974 which was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002. 



TUMBLEWEED MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect Tumbleweeds plans, estimates and beliefs. Tumbleweeds actual results could
differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those listed under Risk Factors.

Overview 

Tumbleweed
is a leading provider of secure messaging applications for businesses and government organizations using the Internet. Tumbleweed enables businesses to share sensitive information via e-mail with customers, business partners, and suppliers,
transforming e-mail into a tool for enhancing communication and increasing productivity. By deploying our secure messaging solutions, businesses improve their ability to enhance customer service, automate traditional paper and voice-based processes,
enable secure collaboration with partners, comply with government and company policies to limit liability, enhance employee productivity, and prevent network disruption. 

Tumbleweeds suite of secure messaging products provide solutions to important productivity, customer
service and online security needs. By deploying some or all of our solutions, our customers can: 



defend their top line against competitors by expanding their existing e-channel to include secure e-mail customer service applications; 



improve their bottom line by moving expensive paper- and phone-based processes online; 



improve communications with partners, while at the same time protecting valuable intellectual property through secure collaborative partner networks;



improve the organizations liability by ensuring that internal and customer communications comply with company, human resources, or government regulations,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA; and 



reduce network congestion as well as enhance employee productivity by keeping spam and e-mail viruses out of the enterprise network. 

On January 31, 2000, Tumbleweed completed the acquisition of
Worldtalk Communications Corporation, or Worldtalk, a provider of Internet security and policy management solutions that enable organizations to define and manage e-mail and web security usage policies to manage the risks and liabilities associated
with Internet communications. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each Worldtalk share of common stock has been converted into 0.26 of a share of our common stock. A total of 3,798,398 shares of our common stock were exchanged for 14,609,374
shares of Worldtalk common stock. The business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, our historical financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of Worldtalk.

On May 15, 2000, Tumbleweed repurchased from
Hikari Tsushin 5% of the outstanding stock of Tumbleweed Communications KK, for a price of approximately $645,000. As a result of this transaction, we owned a controlling interest of Tumbleweed Communications KK and began accounting for Tumbleweed
Communications KK under the consolidation method effective April 1, 2000. On August 29, 2000, we repurchased an additional 25% of the outstanding shares of Tumbleweed Communications KK, increasing our ownership position to 80%. During the six months
ended June 30, 2002, Tumbleweed Communications KK experienced a sustained decline in operations. As a result, we reevaluated our future prospects in Japan and decided to transition to an indirect sales distribution model in Japan. During the
three months ended 



September 30, 2002, we began the liquidation of Tumbleweed Communications KK. Tumbleweed Communications KK ceased operations in
August 2002 and formally declared bankruptcy in December 2002. 

On August 1, 2000, Tumbleweed completed a primary and secondary public offering of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $56.00 per share. Of the 3,000,000 shares of common stock, 1,500,000 primary shares were sold by us
and 1,500,000 secondary shares were sold by our stockholders. Tumbleweed did not receive any of the proceeds from shares sold by its stockholders. Net proceeds of $77.9 million from the offering of primary shares have been used for working capital
and other general corporate purposes. 

On
September 1, 2000, Tumbleweed completed the acquisition of Interface Systems, Inc., or Interface. Interfaces Legacy to Internet, or L2i, products and services simplify the process of transforming and using data found in legacy computer systems
into electronic content that is easy to distribute and use online. The combination of L2i with Tumbleweed IME gives our customers a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for secure electronic statement presentment known as Tumbleweed Secure Statements.
We divested the Interface businesses other than L2i. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price of $77.1 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Since September 1, 2000, Interfaces results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the intangible assets was determined based upon a
valuation using a combination of methods, including a cost approach for the assembled workforce, and an income approach for the core technology. The purchase price of $77.1 million consisted of an exchange of 1,249,210 shares of our common stock
with a fair value of $64.2 million, assumed stock options with a fair value of $7.9 million, cash paid of $2.0 million, and other acquisition related expenses of $2.9 million consisting primarily of payments for investment bankers fees, legal
fees, accounting fees, and printer fees. 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2001, Tumbleweed performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Interface. The assessment was performed primarily due to changes
in the economy, the overall decline in the industry growth rates, and our lower actual and projected operating results including that of the business acquired from Interface. Our assessment was supported by the significant sustained decline in our
stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the Interface acquisition, which resulted in the net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization. As a result of our review,
we recorded a $51.0 million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets. The charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining estimated useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of
15%. The assumptions supporting the cash flows including the discount rate were determined using our estimates as of March 31, 2001. The remaining intangible assets were amortized in full over their remaining useful life in 2001. 

In January 2001, Tumbleweeds Board of Directors approved
a restructuring program. This restructuring program was intended to align our cost structures with our company-wide focus on customer service, sales, and research and development. The restructuring involved consolidating our facilities in the U.S.
and closing sales offices in Paris, France; Chatsworth, Australia; and Stockholm, Sweden, realigning our professional services organization, and reducing headcount in most areas of our business. The reduction in force involved approximately 100
employees and total charges incurred as a result of the restructuring were $4.7 million during 2001, which includes charges related to vacating leased facilities domestically and abroad. As of December 31, 2002, we had no remaining liabilities
relating to the restructuring expenses we recorded in 2001. 

During 2002, Tumbleweed transitioned from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan due to sustained declines in the operating results of those regions. In Europe, we are winding down our direct sales
operations and have signed a reseller agreement with a distributor to sell our products and provide technical support to our customers there. In Japan, we transitioned to an indirect sales distribution model. During the three months ended
September 30, 2002, we began the liquidation of Tumbleweed Communications KK. Subsequently, Tumbleweed Communications KK ceased operations in August 2002 and formally declared bankruptcy in December 2002. 



In August
2002, Tumbleweeds Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock. Although we are not required to purchase any stock under the program, we may purchase shares either in the open market or in
negotiated transactions as market and business conditions warrant. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The purchases are made at current
market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market and are funded using our working capital. The repurchase program extends over a twelve month period and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In October 2002, we adopted a 10b5-1
plan, which allows us to repurchase our stock under our repurchase program during a period in which we are in possession of material non-public information, provided we previously communicated repurchase instructions to our broker at a time when we
were not in possession of such material non-public information. The 10b5-1 plan does not increase the aggregate $10.0 million amount authorized for repurchase purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2002 we repurchased 717,500 shares of
our common stock for $796,000. 

Tumbleweeds
future net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by limitations on our ability to apply net operating losses for federal income tax reporting purposes against taxable income in future periods, including limitations due to ownership changes,
as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, arising from issuance of stock. 

Recent Development 

On February 18, 2003, Tumbleweed announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with Valicert, Inc, or Valicert. Pending stockholder and regulatory approvals, we agreed to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Valicert in a stock-for-stock transaction. As approved by the Boards of Directors of each company, the merger calls for each share of Valicert common stock to be exchanged for 0.385 shares of Tumbleweed common stock, or
approximately 9.8 million shares, which will represent approximately 

% of Tumbleweeds outstanding common stock as of the record date assuming no exercise of outstanding Tumbleweed and Valicert options and
warrants. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2003, depending on regulatory review. 

Years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 

Revenue.
    Revenue, which consists of both product and intellectual property, or IP, revenue as well as services revenue, results from new contracts and backlog. We define backlog as deferred
revenue, contractual commitments that are not due and payable as of the balance sheet date, or collectibility is in doubt, and/or for whom the product or service has not yet been delivered. Product and IP revenue consists of license and transaction
fees, patent license agreement fees, and the sale of distribution rights. Services revenue includes support and maintenance, consulting, and training fees. Total revenue decreased to $25.5 million in 2002 from $29.0 million in 2001. The
decrease in revenue was due to decreases in revenue from our international regions in Europe and Asia, which decreased to $1.6 million from $4.4 million and to $0.4 million from $2.6 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue in Europe and
Asia was due to the tight discretionary spending of our international installed customer base which led to limited product expansion and maintenance and support revenues within that customer base. As a result, we decided to transition from direct
sales operations to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan. As we identified and developed partners for indirect sales, we experienced a further decline in revenue from Europe and Asia in 2002. Revenue from those regions could decrease on a
year-over-year basis in future years due to the indirect sales operations transition. 

Product and IP revenue decreased to $15.7 million in 2002 from $18.4 million in 2001. The decrease in product and IP revenue was due to a decrease in product revenue from our international regions in
Europe and Asia , which decreased to $1.1 million from $2.8 million and to $0.3 million from $1.6 million, respectively. The decrease was due to our decision to transition to an indirect sales operations model in Europe and Japan due to sustained
declines in the operating results of those regions. The decrease in international product revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue of $1.2 million, to more than $2.0 million in 2002, from licensing our IP 



to third parties. During 2001, we began shifting from a transaction-based model to a perpetual license model. Transaction revenue decreased
to $2.5 million in 2002 from $5.3 million in 2001, and is expected to continue to decrease in the future. As part of this transition, many of our former transaction-based customers are purchasing perpetual licenses and associated support and
maintenance contracts. 

Service revenue decreased
to $9.8 million in 2002 from $10.7 million in 2001. The decrease in service revenue was due to our shift in consulting services towards supporting our customer implementations of our product and away from a more generalized secure messaging
consulting practice. This transition resulted in the reduction in the number of revenue generating projects and revenue generating consultants. As a result, our consulting revenue decreased to $2.5 million in 2002 from $6.3 million in 2001. We
expect consulting revenue to decline in fiscal year 2003 as we continue this transition. This decrease in consulting revenue in 2002 was partially offset by an increase in maintenance revenue to $7.2 million in 2002 from $4.3 million in 2001.

Cost of
Revenue
.    Cost of revenue is comprised of product license costs and service costs. Product license cost is primarily comprised of royalties paid to third parties for software licensed by us for inclusion in our products.
Service costs are comprised primarily of personnel and overhead costs related to customer support and consulting and contract development projects with third parties. Total cost of revenue decreased to $7.1 million, or 28% of revenue, in 2002 from
$12.3 million, or 42% of revenue, in 2001. The decrease in product cost is due to the decrease in product revenues that require us to pay third party royalty fees. The decrease in cost of services revenue, as a percentage of revenue, was due to a
shift in our services revenue mix to higher-margin support and maintenance revenue from lower-margin consulting revenue. The decrease in cost of services revenue, in absolute dollars, was primarily due to a decrease in employees and related employee
costs. The decrease in employees was driven by our increased focus regarding the direct implementation and development of our core products, and the transition from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan which
reduced our professional services headcount in those regions to zero. 

Research and Development Expenses
.    Research and development expenses are comprised of engineering and other related personnel costs, the development of our applications, quality assurance, and
testing. Research and development expenses decreased to $10.1 million in 2002 from $15.9 million in 2001. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease of 13 employees and related employee costs, including
the elimination of bonuses and salary reductions, and a decrease in depreciation expense due to assets becoming fully depreciated, lower capital expenditures as compared to 2001 and 2000, and a reduction in allocated overhead charges. The decrease
of employees is due to our decision to reduce the number of our product offerings and outsource development for non-core product offerings. Overhead charges were reduced due to our reduction in information technology spending and our reduction in
facilities costs. We believe that our investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and therefore expect to maintain resource levels consistent with the last quarter of 2002. In addition, we are focused on controlling
costs throughout our company. As part of this effort, we are outsourcing development for those non-core products for which we can reduce costs and meet delivery requirements. We have also reduced the information technology and facilities costs
required to support the same levels of resources. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses
.    Sales and marketing expenses are comprised of salaries, commissions, travel expenses, other related personnel costs, and costs associated with marketing programs. Sales and
marketing expenses decreased to $18.0 million in 2002 from $36.4 million in 2001. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to decreased employees as well as lower marketing program expenses. The decrease in employees was due to
a shift in our sales focus towards large accounts in target industries which allowed us to reduce the number of direct sales representatives and sales support employees in North America by 19, and the transition from direct sales operations to
indirect sales operations in Europe and Asia, which reduced the number of employees by 50. Marketing programs expense also declined by $3.4 million. We intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts in North America to
increase customer awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers. We expect sales and marketing expense to decrease in absolute dollars in 2003 due to our transition to indirect sales operations in Europe and Japan.



General and
Administrative Expenses
.    General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for our finance, legal, information systems, and human resources departments as well as public reporting costs,
and professional fees. General and administrative expenses decreased to $4.7 million in 2002 from $9.3 million in 2001. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in employees and related employee costs,
including the elimination of bonuses and salary reductions, a reduction in overhead costs, a reduction in expenses with application service providers due to bringing administration for our enterprise software systems in-house, and lower bad debt
expense. The lower bad debt expense resulted from a decrease in the size of our accounts receivable balance, increased collections efforts and more centralized operations in the United States, and improved geographic and industry mix of our
customers. Overhead charges were reduced due to our reduction in information technology spending and our reduction in facilities costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2003 due to increased expense related to
intellectual property licensing, enforcement and development and increased public company expenses. 

Stock-based Compensation Expense
.    Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with the
amortization of deferred stock compensation recorded as a result of grants of stock options to non-employees and employees at exercise prices less than the fair value on the grant date, the vesting acceleration of stock options approved for certain
employees, and warrants granted to non-employees in exchange for services performed, net of credits related to stock options granted to employees who were later terminated. Stock-based compensation expense is included in Tumbleweeds cost of
revenues and operating expenses in Tumbleweeds statement of operations. This expense is being amortized over the vesting period of the options, which is generally four years. Stock-based compensation expense in 2002 was a credit of ($301,000)
compared to $3.1 million in 2001. The credit to stock-based compensation expense in 2002 was the result of the termination of certain employees whose options had not yet vested, in excess of continued amortization. 

Amortization of Goodwill and Intangible
Assets
.    Goodwill and other intangible assets resulted from the purchase of Interface and, to a lesser extent, Tumbleweeds increase in ownership of Tumbleweed Communications KK from 50% to 80% during 2000. In July
2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 (SFAS 142). SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Tumbleweed adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Prior to Tumbleweeds adoption of SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible
assets were amortized over their respective lives, generally one to five years. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased to zero in 2002 from $12.2 million in 2001 as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 and the
intangible assets becoming fully amortized in September 2001. 

Merger-Related and Restructuring Expenses
.    In January 2001, Tumbleweeds Board of Directors approved a restructuring program intended to align its cost structures with its company-wide focus on
customer service, sales, and research and development. The restructuring involved consolidating Tumbleweeds facilities in the United States and closing international sales office locations in Paris, France; Chatsworth, Australia; and
Stockholm, Sweden. The restructuring program also realigned Tumbleweeds professional services organization and reduced headcount in most areas of our business. The reduction in force involved approximately 100 employees and total charges
incurred as a result of the restructuring were $4.7 million in 2001, which includes charges related to vacating leased facilities domestically and abroad. As of December 31, 2002, Tumbleweed had no remaining liabilities relating to the
restructuring expenses it recorded in 2001. 



Impairment
of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
.    During the three months ended March 31, 2001, Tumbleweed performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of
Interface. The assessment was performed primarily due to changes in the economy, the overall decline in the industry growth rate, and Tumbleweeds lower actual and projected operating results including that of the business acquired from
Interface. Tumbleweeds assessment was supported by the significant sustained decline in its stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the Interface acquisition. As a result of the assessment, Tumbleweed recorded a $51.0
million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets to their estimated fair value. The charge was based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and other intangible assets using a
discount rate of 15%. The assumptions supporting the cash flows, including the discount rate, were determined using Tumbleweeds best estimates as of March 31, 2001. The remaining intangible assets were amortized in full over their remaining
useful life during 2001. 

In connection with
SFAS 142s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, Tumbleweed assessed whether there was an indication that goodwill recorded in connection with its acquisition of Tumbleweed Communications KK was impaired as of the date of adoption.
To accomplish this, Tumbleweed determined the carrying value of its reporting unit by assigning its assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to Tumbleweeds reporting unit as of the date of adoption. As our
Tumbleweed Communications KK reporting units carrying amount exceeded its fair value, we compared the implied fair value of Tumbleweed Communications KK goodwill, determined by allocating Tumbleweed Communications KK fair value to all of its
assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities to its carrying amount, both of which were measured as of the date of adoption. A transitional impairment loss of $1.0 million was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in our consolidated statement of operations. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2002, Tumbleweed Communications KK experienced a sustained decline in operations.
