Dear Multilink Shareholder: 

After careful consideration, the board of directors of Multilink Technology Corporation has unanimously approved the merger of Multilink with a subsidiary
of Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, whereby Multilink will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse. 

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Multilink, which will be held at Multilinks principal executive
offices, located at 300 Atrium Drive in Somerset, New Jersey, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on August 19, 2003. Only shareholders who hold shares of Multilink common stock at the close of business on July 15, 2003 will be entitled to vote at the
special meeting. A formal meeting notice and proxy statement/prospectus are attached. The enclosed proxy statement/prospectus provides detailed information regarding Multilink, Vitesse and the merger. 

At the special meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve the merger and
the merger agreement with Vitesse under which each share of Multilink Class A and Class B common stock will be converted into 0.5493 of a share of Vitesse common stock, and Multilink will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Vitesse. Vitesse common
stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol VTSS. Multilink Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol MLTC. There is no established trading market for the Multilink Class
B common stock. 

Chanin Capital L.L.C. has rendered an opinion
to a special committee of our board of directors, which consisted of two of our independent directors, that, as of June 9, 2003, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to our shareholders. Based on this fairness opinion
and other considerations, the special committee unanimously recommended to our board of directors that it approve the merger. After receipt of such recommendation and consideration of other issues, our board of directors unanimously approved the
merger. Our board of directors and the special committee believe that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best interest of, our company and our shareholders. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the
merger. 

Certain of our shareholders, including certain of our
officers and directors, who beneficially own approximately 43.0% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and 78.9% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock as of the close of business on July 15, 2003, have agreed to vote
FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. Each of these shareholders has also granted an irrevocable proxy and a power of attorney to Vitesse representatives to vote his, her or its shares of our common stock
FOR adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Whether or not you attend the special meeting, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the meeting. Therefore, I urge you to sign, date and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope. Returning your completed proxy card will ensure your representation at the special meeting. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

We look forward to seeing you on August 19, 2003. 

Sincerely, 

Richard N. Nottenburg, Ph.D. 

President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR MULTILINK SHAREHOLDERS 

Q:

What is the merger? (See page
 38)

A:

The merger will be the acquisition of Multilink by Vitesse through the merger of Margaux Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse, with Multilink. Upon
consummation of the merger, Multilink will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse. After the merger, the current shareholders of Vitesse will own approximately 97% of Vitesse and the former shareholders of Multilink will own approximately 3% of
Vitesse. 

Q:

What will Multilink shareholders and optionholders receive in the merger? (See pages 59 and 60)

A:

When the merger is completed, holders of Multilink Class A and Class B common stock will receive 0.5493 shares of Vitesse common stock in exchange for each share of Multilink Class
A or Class B common stock. Multilink shareholders who would receive Vitesse fractional shares will instead receive cash in an amount based on the average closing prices, as reported on Nasdaq, of Vitesse common stock for the five trading days
immediately preceding the effective date of the merger multiplied by the fraction of a Vitesse share such shareholder would otherwise receive. 

Options and warrants to purchase shares of Multilink common stock will be converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of Vitesse common stock
after completion of the merger. The number of shares covered by, and the exercise price for, each option or warrant will be adjusted using the merger exchange ratio of 0.5493 shares of Vitesse for each share of Multilink. 

Q:

What vote is required to approve the merger? (see page 35) 

A:

Holders of a majority of the outstanding Multilink Class A common stock and a majority of the outstanding Multilink Class B common stock, voting as separate classes, must approve
the terms of the merger and the merger agreement. 

Q:

Does the board of directors of Multilink recommend voting in favor of the merger? (See page 43)

A:

Yes. After careful consideration, Multilinks board of directors unanimously recommends that its shareholders vote in favor of the merger agreement and the proposed merger.

Q:

Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger? (See page 12)

A:

Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and especially consider the factors discussed in the section entitled Risk
Factors. 

Q:

What do I need to do now?

A:

Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the special meeting. Directions are included on the
enclosed proxy card. If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed proxy, your shares will be voted FOR approval of the merger. 

Please do not send your Multilink stock certificates at this time.

Q:

If my shares are held in street name by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:

Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker. 

Q:

What do I do if I want to change my vote after I have sent in my proxy card? (See page 36)

A:

If you want to change your vote, send the secretary of Multilink a later-dated, signed proxy card before the special meeting or attend the special meeting in person. You may also
revoke your proxy by sending written notice to the secretary of Multilink before the special meeting. 

Q:

As a Multilink shareholder, should I send in my Multilink stock certificates now?

A:

No. After the merger is completed, you will be sent written instructions for exchanging your Multilink stock certificates for Vitesse stock certificates. 



Q:

When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:

Multilink and Vitesse are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope to complete the merger shortly after the special meeting. 

Q:

Will I recognize an income tax gain or loss on the merger (See page 52)?

A:

The merger has been structured to qualify as a reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization, Multilink
shareholders will generally not recognize taxable gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in connection with the merger, except to the extent they receive cash received instead of fractional shares or receive cash because they
exercise statutory dissenters rights. Nevertheless, all Multilink shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine their particular tax consequences. 

Q:

Am I entitled to appraisal rights? (See page 
55)

A:

Holders of Multilink Class B common stock and certain holders of Multilink Class A common 
stock who vote against the merger and properly
exercise their dissenters rights will have the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of their shares of Multilink common stock, as determined in accordance with Article 13 of the General Corporation Law of California. Any
payment of fair value will be in lieu of the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement and could be more than, the same as, or less valuable than the agreed upon merger consideration. Any shareholder wishing to exercise
dissenters rights must take affirmative steps to preserve those rights. A copy of Article 13 of the General Corporation Law of California is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is summarized below in California
Dissenters Rights on page 55. 

Q:

Whom should I call with questions?

A:

Multilink shareholders should call Richard Sawchak, Director of Investor Relations, at (732) 537-3776, with any questions about the merger.

Summary of the Merger 

The Merger (See page 38)

In the merger, Multilink will merge with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Vitesse called Margaux Acquisition Corporation. Upon consummation of the merger, Multilink will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse. As a result of the merger, Multilink common shareholders will receive 0.5493 shares of Vitesse
common stock in exchange for each of their Multilink shares. 

The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read it carefully. 

Conditions to completion of the merger (See page 62) 

Multilinks and Vitesses obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or 



waiver of closing conditions, including approval by Multilink shareholders. 

Vote required for approval (See page 35) 

The holders of a majority of the shares of Multilink Class A common stock outstanding and the holders of a majority of the shares of Multilink Class B
common stock outstanding, voting as separate classes, must approve the merger agreement and the terms of the merger. Multilink shareholders holding approximately 43.0% of the outstanding Class A common stock and shareholders holding approximately
78.9% of the outstanding Class B common stock as of the record date for the special meeting have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Termination of the merger agreement (See page 63) 

Multilink and Vitesse have the right to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances. In certain cases,
termination of the merger agreement will require payment of a termination fee and expenses to Vitesse. 

Opinion of Multilinks financial advisor (See page 42) 

In deciding to approve the merger, Multilinks board of directors considered, among other things, the opinion of Chanin Capital L.L.C. to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Multilink common stock. The opinion of the financial advisor is attached to the back of this proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex C, and should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Chanin Capital L.L.C. The opinion of Chanin Capital L.L.C. is directed to the special
committee of the Multilink board. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder should vote with respect to any matter relating to the proposed merger. 

U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger (See page 52) 

The merger has been structured to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization, holders of Multilink common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of their Multilink
shares for shares of Vitesse common stock in the merger, except to the extent they receive cash for a fractional share of Vitesse common stock or they receive cash because they exercise statutory dissenters rights. The companies themselves, as
well as current holders of Vitesse common stock, will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger. It is a condition to the obligation of Multilink to complete the merger that it receives a legal opinion from its outside counsel that the
merger will be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all shareholders of Multilink, including certain holders specifically referred to on page 52. Your tax consequences will depend on your own situation. You
should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of the merger to you. 

Accounting treatment of the merger (See page 54) 

The merger will be accounted as a purchase of a business, as such term is used under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
Accordingly, the consideration paid for the acquired Multilink shares will be allocated to the assets and liabilities of Multilink based on their respective fair values. 

Interests of certain persons in the merger (See page 49) 

When considering the recommendation of Multilinks board of directors, Multilink shareholders should be aware that
certain Multilink directors, officers and shareholders have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours. These interests include options held by various executive officers and directors and the potential
acceleration of those options upon completion of the merger, the effect of the merger on employment arrangements with executives of Multilink and the indemnification of directors and officers of Multilink against certain liabilities both before and
after the merger. Multilinks officers and directors control 40.9% of the shares of Multilink Class A common stock and 60.8% of the shares of Multilink Class B common stock. 



Dissenters rights (See page 55) 

Holders of Multilink Class B common stock and certain holders of Multilink Class A common stock who vote against the merger
and properly exercise their dissenters rights will have the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of their shares of Multilink common stock, as determined in accordance with Article 13 of the General Corporation Law of
California. Any payment of fair value will be in lieu of the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement and could be more than, the same as or less valuable than the agreed upon merger consideration. A copy of Article 13 of the
General Corporation Law of California is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is summarized below in California Dissenters Rights on page 55. Any shareholder wishing to exercise dissenters rights must
take affirmative steps to preserve these rights.

Restrictions on the
ability to sell Vitesse stock (See page 52) 

All shares of
Vitesse common stock received by Multilink shareholders in connection with the merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act of 
1933 unless the holder is considered an affiliate of either
Multilink or Vitesse. Shares of Vitesse held by such affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption from the Securities Act. 

Comparative market price information (See page 10)

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA 

The
following table reflects (a) the historical net income (loss) and book value per share of Vitesse common stock and the historical net income (loss) and book value per share of Multilink common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro forma net
loss and book value per share after giving effect to Vitesses proposed merger with Multilink, and (b) the equivalent historical net loss and book value per share attributable to 0.5493 shares of Vitesse common stock which will be received for
each share of Multilink Class A or Class B common stock. 

The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders equity as of September 30, 2002, and March 31, 2003, respectively, by the actual common shares outstanding. The pro forma per share net loss is computed by
dividing the pro forma net loss by the pro forma weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming Vitesse had merged with Multilink at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma combined book value per share is computed by
dividing total pro forma stockholders equity by the pro forma number of common shares outstanding at March 31, 2003, assuming the merger had occurred on that date. The Multilink equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated by
multiplying the Vitesse pro forma combined per share amounts by the common stock exchange ratio of 0.5493. 

The following information should be read in conjunction with the separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Vitesse and Multilink, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes of Vitesse and Multilink, and the selected historical financial data included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated
herein by reference. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger with Multilink had been consummated as
of the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined companies. Neither Multilink nor Vitesse has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its
capital stock.

Both Multilink shareholders and Vitesse stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for
Multilink common stock and Vitesse common stock. No assurance can be given as to the market prices of Multilink common stock or Vitesse common stock at any time before the consummation of merger or as to the market price of Vitesse common stock at
any time after merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate Multilink shareholders for decreases in the market price of Vitesse common stock which could occur before the merger becomes effective.
In the event the market price of Vitesse common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation of merger, the value of the Vitesse common stock to be received in the merger in exchange for Multilink common stock would correspondingly
decrease or increase. 

Dividends 

Neither Multilink nor
Vitesse has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its capital stock. If the merger is not consummated, the Multilink and Vitesse boards anticipate that they would continue their policy of retaining all earnings to finance the expansion of their
businesses. Neither company anticipates paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Multilink and Vitesse expect the combined company to retain all earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business and they do not anticipate
Vitesse will pay any cash dividends after the merger.



RISK FACTORS 

The merger
involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the merger, current Multilink shareholders will be choosing to invest in Vitesse common stock. An investment in Vitesse common stock involves a high degree of risk. References in this section to
we, us, our and similar language refers to Vitesse and its subsidiaries including, after the merger, Multilink. In addition to the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by
reference, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger. 

Risks relating to Vitesse and the combined company 

We have experienced continuing losses from operations since March 31, 2001, and we expect that our operating results will fluctuate in the future due to reduced demand in our markets 

Since our quarterly revenues peaked in the quarter ended December 31, 2000,
our revenues have declined substantially and we have experienced continuing losses from operations. While our revenues have improved slightly since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, they are still not sufficient to cover our operating expenses.
Further, in fiscal 2002 our operating results were materially and adversely affected by an inventory write-down, restructuring charges and impairment charges. If we are required to take additional charges such as these in the future, the adverse
effect on our operating results may again be material. Due to general economic conditions and slowdowns in purchases of networking equipment, it has become increasingly difficult for us to predict the purchasing activities of our customers and we
expect that our operating results will fluctuate substantially in the future. We cannot predict when we will again achieve profitability, if at all. Future fluctuations in operating results may also be caused by a number of factors, many of which
are outside our control. Additional factors that could affect our future operating results include the following: 



The loss of major customers; 



Variations, delays or cancellations of orders and shipments of our products; 



Reduction in the selling prices of our products; 



Significant changes in the type and mix of products being sold; 



Delays in introducing new products; 



Design changes made by our customers; 



Our failure to manufacture and ship products on time; 



Changes in manufacturing capacity, the utilization of this capacity and manufacturing yields; 



Variations in product development costs; 



Changes in inventory levels; and 



Expenses or operational disruptions resulting from acquisitions. 

In fiscal 2002, we implemented significant cost reductions. We do not expect that these measures will be sufficient to offset lower revenues until fiscal
2004, if at all, and as such, we expect to incur a net loss for the remainder of fiscal 2003. In the past, we have recorded significant new product development costs because our policy is to expense these costs at the time that they are incurred. We
may incur these types of expenses in the future. These additional expenses will have a material and adverse effect on our results in future periods. The occurrence of any of the above-mentioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business and on our financial results. 



The market price for our common stock has been volatile and future volatility could cause the value of your investment
in our company to decline. 

Our stock price has
experienced significant volatility recently. In particular, our stock price declined significantly following announcements made by us and other semiconductor suppliers of reduced revenue expectations and of a general slowdown in the technology
sector, particularly the optical networking equipment sector. Given these general economic conditions and the reduced demand for our products that we have experienced recently, we expect that our stock price will continue to be volatile. In
addition, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors, among others, upon the market price of our common stock: 



Additional changes in financial analysts estimates of our revenues and operating results; 



Our failure to meet financial analysts performance expectations; and 



Changes in market valuations of other companies in the semiconductor or networking industries. 

In addition, many of the risks described elsewhere in this section could materially and adversely affect our stock price, as
discussed in those risk factors. The stock markets have recently experienced substantial price and volume volatility. Fluctuations such as these have affected and are likely to continue to affect the market price of our common stock. 

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted
against companies following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of such companies securities. If instituted against us, regardless of the outcome, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our
managements attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages, if we were to lose such a
lawsuit. 

If we are unable to develop and introduce new products
successfully or to achieve market acceptance of our new products, our operating results would be adversely affected. 

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new high-performance integrated circuits and optical modules for existing and new markets,
introduce these products in a cost-effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products. Our quarterly results in the past have been, and are expected in the future
to continue to be, dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers. The development of new integrated circuits is highly complex, and from time to time
we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. In addition, we only introduced optical modules since our acquisition of Versatile Optical Networks, Inc. (Versatile), in July 2001, and only
began to see significant sales of these products since the quarter ended June 30, 2002. Our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to: 



Accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards; 



Accurately define new products; 



Timely complete and introduce new products; 



Timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and our customers products into which our products will be incorporated;



Achieve high manufacturing yields; and 



Gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products. 

If we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and
adversely affected. 



We are dependent on a small number of customers in a few industries 

We intend to continue focusing our sales effort on a small number of
customers in the communications and storage markets that require high-performance integrated circuits. Some of these customers are also our competitors. For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, one customer accounted for greater than 10% of total
revenues. If any of our major customers delays orders of our products or stops buying our products, our business and financial condition would be severely affected. 

There are risks associated with recent and future acquisitions 

Since the beginning of fiscal 2000, we have made five significant acquisitions: 



In March 2000, we completed the acquisition of Orologic, Inc. (Orologic) in exchange for approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock. 



In May 2000, we completed the acquisition of SiTera Incorporated (SiTera) for approximately 14.7 million shares of our common stock. 



In June 2001, we acquired Exbit Technology A/S (Exbit) for up to approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock and may be required to issue an additional 1.3
million shares upon the attainment of certain internal future retention and performance goals. 



In July 2001, we completed the acquisition of Versatile for approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock. 



In January 2003, we completed the acquisition of APT Technologies, Inc. for approximately $10.0 to $14.4 million, depending on the performance of the acquired business.

Also, during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001, we
completed smaller acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $61.7 million consisting of approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock issued and stock options assumed and approximately $44.6 million in cash. These acquisitions may result in
the diversion of managements attention from the day-to-day operations of our business. Risks of making these acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, products and personnel. If we fail in our efforts to
integrate recent and future acquisitions, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our management frequently evaluates available strategic opportunities. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions of complementary products,
technologies or businesses. Acquisitions we make in the future, including the acquisition of Multilink, could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, substantial debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In particular,
in connection with our acquisition of Orologic, we were required to record an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of $45.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2000. In addition, under the new SFAS No. 142,
which we adopted as of October 1, 2001, certain intangible assets relating to acquired businesses, including goodwill, are maintained on the balance sheet rather than being amortized. These assets must be tested at least annually for impairment, and
in the year ended September 30, 2002, we recorded impairment charges of $403.0 million associated with goodwill and other intangible assets related to past acquisitions. As of March 31, 2003, and after accounting for these impairment charges, we had
an aggregate of $190.3 million of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. As a result of our acquisition of Multilink, we expect to incur additional transaction expenses, IPR&D changes and other expenses, and to record
additional goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. These assets may eventually be written down to the extent they are deemed to be impaired and any such write-downs would adversely affect our results. 

Our industry is highly competitive 

The markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid
technological advancement in design tools, wafer-manufacturing techniques, process tools and alternate networking technologies. We must 



identify and capture future market opportunities to offset the rapid price erosion that characterizes our industry. We may not be able to develop new
products at competitive pricing and performance levels. Even if we are able to do so, we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner. Our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation
equipment with those of current or future competitors. Our competitors include Agere, Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, Broadcom, Conexant Systems, IBM, Intel, Infineon, Marvell, Maxim Integrated Products and PMC Sierra. We also compete with
internal ASIC design units of systems companies such as Cisco and Nortel. Over the next few years, we expect additional competitors, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to enter the market with new products. In addition, we
are aware of venture-backed companies that focus on specific portions of our product line. These companies, individually or collectively, could represent future competition for many design wins and subsequent product sales. 

We typically face competition at the design stage, where customers evaluate
alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits. Our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because of shortened product life and design-in cycles in many of our
customers products. 

Competition is particularly strong
in the market for optical networking chips, in part due to the markets past growth rate, which attracts larger competitors, and in part due to the number of smaller companies focused on this area. These companies, individually and
collectively, represent strong competition for many design wins and subsequent product sales. Larger competitors in our market have acquired both mature and early stage companies with advanced technologies. These acquisitions could enhance the
ability of larger competitors to obtain new business that Vitesse might have otherwise won. 

There are risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 

In second quarter of fiscal 2003, international sales accounted for 30% of our total revenues, and we expect international sales to constitute a
substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future. International sales involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, including risks related to: 



Reliance on strategic alliance partners; 



Compliance with foreign regulatory requirements; 



Variability of foreign economic conditions; 



Changing restrictions imposed by U.S. export laws; and 



Competition from U.S. based companies that have firmly established significant international operations. 

Failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our international sales, which could in
turn have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

We must keep pace with product development and technological change 

The market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies. We believe that our success to a large extent
depends on our ability to continue to improve our product technologies and to develop new products and technologies in order to maintain our competitive position. Further, we must adapt our products to technological changes and adopt emerging
industry standards. Our failure to accomplish any of the above could have a negative impact on our business and financial results. 

We are dependent on key suppliers 

We manufacture our products using a variety of components procured from third-party suppliers. All of our high-performance integrated circuits are
packaged by third parties. Other components and materials used in our 



manufacturing process are available from only a limited number of sources. Further, we are increasingly relying on third-party semiconductor foundries for
our supply of silicon-based products. Any difficulty in obtaining sole- or limited-sourced parts or services from third parties could affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers. This in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our customer relationships, business and financial results. 

Our
manufacturing yields are subject to fluctuation 

Semiconductor fabrication is a highly complex and precise process. Defects in masks, impurities in the materials used, contamination of the manufacturing environment and equipment failures can cause a large percentage of wafers or die to be
rejected. Manufacturing yields vary among products, depending on a particular high-performance integrated circuits complexity and on our experience in manufacturing it. In the past, we have experienced difficulties in achieving acceptable
yields on some high-performance integrated circuits, which has led to shipment delays. 

Since a majority of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, maintaining a number of shippable die per wafer is critical to our operating results. Yield decreases can result in higher unit costs and may adversely
affect gross profit and net income. We use estimated yields for valuing work-in-process inventory. If actual yields are materially different than these estimates, we may need to revalue work-in-process inventory. Consequently, if any of our current
or future products experience yield problems, our financial results may be adversely affected. 

Our business is subject to environmental regulations 

We are subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile and other hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. If we fail to comply with these regulations, this failure could result in
the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations. Additionally, we may be restricted in our ability to expand operations at our present locations or we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these
regulations. 

Our failure to manage growth of operations may adversely
affect us 

The management of our growth requires qualified
personnel, systems and other resources. We have recently established several product design centers worldwide and completed several acquisitions since the fall of 1998. We have only limited experience in integrating the operations of acquired
businesses. Failure to manage our growth or to successfully integrate new and future facilities or newly acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 

We are dependent on key personnel 

Due to the specialized nature of our business, our success depends in part
upon attracting and retaining the services of qualified managerial and technical personnel. The competition for qualified personnel is intense. The loss of any of our key employees or the failure to hire additional skilled technical personnel could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 

Our
ability to repurchase our debentures, if required, with cash, upon a change of control may be limited 

In certain circumstances involving a change of control or the termination of public trading of our common stock, holders of our 4% convertible
subordinated debentures may require us to repurchase some or all of the debentures. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the debentures.

Our ability to repurchase the debentures in such event may be
limited by law, by the indenture, by the terms of other agreements relating to our senior debt and by such indebtedness and agreements as may be entered into, 



replaced, supplemented or amended from time to time. We may be required to refinance our debt in order to make such payments. We may not have the financial
ability to repurchase the debentures if payment of our debt is accelerated. 

General risks relating to the proposed merger 

The 0.5493 exchange ratio does not protect Multilink shareholders from fluctuations in the market price of Vitesse common stock. 

Upon completion of the merger, each share of Multilink common stock will be exchanged for 0.5493 of a share of Vitesse common stock. There will be no
adjustment to the exchange ratio for changes in the market price of Vitesse common stock. Vitesse and Multilink are not permitted to abandon the merger other than under limited circumstances (which do not include changes in the market price of
Vitesse common stock), nor is Multilink permitted to resolicit the vote of its shareholders solely because of changes in the market price of Vitesse common stock. The specific dollar value of Vitesse common stock to be received by Multilink
shareholders upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of Vitesse common stock at that time. The share price of Vitesse common stock is by nature subject to the general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity
securities and has experienced significant volatility. Accordingly, if the market value of Vitesse common stock declines prior to the time the merger is completed, the value of the merger consideration to be received by Multilink shareholders will
decline. In addition, because the date that the merger is completed may be later than the date of Multilinks special meeting, Multilink shareholders will not know the exact value of the Vitesse common stock that will be issued in the merger at
the time they vote on the merger proposal. No prediction can be made as to the market price of Vitesse common stock either before or after completion of the merger. 

The anticipated benefits of the merger to the combined company may not be realized. 

Vitesse and Multilink entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger will result in benefits, including: 



combining complementary technologies permitting Vitesse and Multilink to provide products with more complete solutions than either company can now provide; 



a combined company with greater financial, technology and human resources for developing new products and providing greater sales and marketing resources to help promote and sell
the products of Vitesse and Multilink; and 



providing each company with access to the other companys customer base and thus increasing distribution of Vitesses and Multilinks products.

Achieving the benefits of the merger will,
however, depend in part on the integration of the technology, operations and personnel of the two companies in a timely and efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the merger will result in the loss of key employees or the continued
diversion of the attention of management. In addition, synergies from the merger may not materialize. Integrating sales of Multilinks products into Vitesses business model will involve risks that may jeopardize the success of the
combined company. 

We cannot assure you that Multilink will be
successfully integrated into Vitesse or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on Vitesses business, financial condition and operating results. Nor can Vitesse assure
you that the stockholders of the combined company will achieve greater value through share ownership of the combined entity than they would have achieved as shareholders of Multilink as a separate entity. 



Certain officers and directors of Multilink have conflicts of interest that may have influenced them to support or
approve the merger. 

Richard N. Nottenburg, Chairman of
the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer of Multilink, has been awarded a cash bonus of $300,000 that will be paid upon completion of the merger, at which time Dr. Nottenburg will become an employee of Vitesse. In addition, Dr. Nottenburg
beneficially owns or controls a majority of Multilink Class B common stock. You should consider whether these interests and benefits may have influenced Dr. Nottenburg to support or approve the merger as a director or recommend that the merger be
approved by the Multilink shareholders. In addition, certain other officers of Multilink may receive severance packages, including accelerated vesting of options, if they are terminated in connection with or after the merger. You should consider
whether these severance arrangements may have influenced Multilinks officers to support the merger. Finally, certain of Multilinks non-employee directors beneficially own a substantial portion of Multilink Class A common stock. You
should consider whether these interests and benefits may have influenced these directors decision to approve the merger. 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect Multilinks stock price, future business and operations. 

If the merger is not completed for any reason, Multilink may be subject to a
number of material risks, including the following: 



Multilink may be required under certain circumstances to pay Vitesse a termination fee of $1.0 million, as well as reimburse Vitesse for its costs related to the merger;



The price of Multilinks common stock may decline; and 



Costs related to the merger, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting and printing fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed. 

In addition, Multilinks customers and strategic partners, in response
to the announcement of the merger, may delay or defer decisions, which could have a material adverse effect on Multilinks business, regardless of whether the merger is ultimately completed. Similarly, current and prospective Multilink
employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. This may be exacerbated by the reductions in force Multilink is undertaking in anticipation of the merger. This may adversely affect Multilinks ability to
attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. If the merger is not completed, Multilink may be forced to rehire terminated personnel or attract new personnel to fill positions that were terminated in anticipation of
the merger. In addition, while the merger agreement is in effect and subject to very narrowly defined exceptions, Multilink is prohibited from soliciting, initiating or encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a
merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any third party and from taking certain actions that would change Multilinks business. 

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a substantial fee in connection with the merger. 

Depending on the total value of the consideration to be received by
Multilinks shareholders in the merger, Multilink may be obligated to pay a transaction fee to an investment bank. Prior to Multilinks engagement of Chanin Capital L.L.C., Multilink entered into an engagement letter in August 2002 with an
investment bank. This engagement letter was terminated by Multilink in November 2002; however, Multilink was subject to a potential obligation to pay a transaction fee to the investment bank if Multilink completed a strategic transaction within
twelve months of the termination of the engagement letter. This fee was contingent upon the total amount of consideration received by Multilink and its shareholders in such a transaction. Pursuant to a May 2003 letter agreement between Multilink and
the investment bank, the investment bank agreed to waive any such fee in connection with the proposed merger between Multilink and Vitesse, on the condition that the total consideration 



to be paid by Vitesse in connection with the merger is less than $30 million, subject to Multilinks reimbursement of the investment banks
incurred expenses of approximately $80,000. In the event that the aggregate value of the consideration paid by Vitesse in the merger exceeds $30 million, Multilink could be required to pay an additional transaction fee to the investment bank.

Risks related to Multilink as an independent entity. 

The following risks pertain to Multilinks historical business as a stand-alone entity. Any of these risks may materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of Vitesse after the
merger. 

The continuing worldwide economic slowdown and related
uncertainties may continue to adversely impact Multilinks revenues and operating results. 

Slower economic activity, concerns about inflation, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business
conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries, and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a continuing downturn in worldwide economic conditions. As a result of these
unfavorable economic conditions, beginning in the first half of 2002, Multilink experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders, an increase in the number of cancellations and rescheduling of backlog, and higher overhead costs as a percentage
of its reduced net revenue, from which it has not recovered. Multilink cannot predict the timing, strength and duration of any economic recovery in the semiconductor industry. In addition, the events of September 11, 2001 and subsequent
international conflicts and terrorist acts can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions make it extremely difficult for Multilink and its customers and vendors to accurately
forecast and plan future business activities. If such conditions continue or worsen, Multilinks business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. 

Multilink is using its available cash to fund its operating activities. 

During the first quarter of 2003, Multilink used $11.4 million of its
available cash, cash equivalents and short term investments to fund its operating, investing and financing activities as conducted prior to signing the merger agreement. Multilink anticipates that it will need approximately $36 to $38 million in
cash, cash equivalents and investments during fiscal year 2003 to fund its operations, investments and financing activities. Multilink believes that it will continue to use its available cash, cash equivalents and investments in the future although
Multilink believes that its has sufficient cash for its needs for at least the next fifteen months. Multilink will continue to experience losses and use its cash, cash equivalents and investments if it does not receive sufficient product orders and
its costs are not controlled. 

Although Multilink undertook
cost reduction programs and initiated its corporate realignment plan during 2002 to reduce expenses, it may still need additional capital. The market for Multilinks products has declined substantially; accordingly, it has continued to utilize
significant amounts of capital. In the event Multilink is required, or elects, to raise additional funds, it may not be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Multilinks inability to raise additional capital could result in the need to
further restructure its operations. 

Multilinks corporate realignment
plan may not be successful and could result in the erosion of employee morale, legal actions against Multilink and management distractions. 

As a result of the continuing significant economic slowdown and the related uncertainties in the technology sector and semiconductor industry, Multilink
initiated a corporate realignment plan during the third quarter of 2002. The plan included workforce reductions, the consolidation of facilities through closure of certain locations, 



a reduction in the level of activity at other locations and expected asset impairment charges. Multilink recorded a charge during 2002 of $11.0 million
associated with its realignment plan. Although Multilink is making every effort to reduce expenses, it still expects to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future due predominantly to the significant and continuing decrease in its
revenues. In establishing the realignment plan, Multilink may have incorrectly anticipated the demand for its products and its ability to execute on the plan. Multilink may be forced to restructure further and the plan may not be successful.

These workforce reductions could result in an erosion of
morale, and a lack of focus and reduced productivity by Multilinks remaining employees, including those directly responsible for revenue generation, which in turn may affect Multilinks revenue in the future. In addition, employees
directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with Multilinks business partners, customers or competitors. Although all employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with Multilink at the time of hire, there can
be no assurances that the confidential nature of Multilinks proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. Additionally, Multilink may face wrongful termination or other claims relating to compensation
asserted by employees directly affected by the reduction. Multilink could incur substantial costs in defending itself or its employees against such claims, regardless of the merits of such actions. Furthermore, such matters could divert the
attention of Multilinks management away from its operations, harm its reputation and increase its expenses, and cause it to not achieve its targeted goals. 

Multilinks operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Any such variations
could adversely affect the market price of the Multilink Class A common stock. 

Multilink operates in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant
downturns such as the current one. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, excess customer inventories, accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity. These factors could cause substantial fluctuations in
Multilinks revenues and in Multilinks results of operations. The current downturn and future downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of this industry to fully recover from the current downturn
would seriously impact Multilinks revenue and harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect
Multilinks ability to ship products in future periods. Multilinks quarterly results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry, which could cause the price of the Multilink Class A common
stock to decline. During the current downturn, Multilinks revenues have decreased for the last six quarters. Multilink can give no assurances that this trend will not continue. 

Multilink has incurred net losses in the past and expects to incur net losses in the future. 

Multilink had net losses of $12.2 million for the quarter ended March 31,
2003, $106.2 million in 2002 and $12.4 million in 2001. Despite Multilinks corporate realignment plan, its ability to achieve profitability will be materially and adversely affected if it fails to significantly increase its revenues. Multilink
anticipates incurring net losses for the foreseeable future. 

Multilinks quarterly revenues and operating results have declined substantially and could continue to decline because of a number of factors. 

Multilinks revenues have declined substantially during the past several quarters. Because of general economic
conditions and slowdowns in purchases of optical networking equipment, it has become increasingly difficult for Multilink to predict the purchasing activities of its customers. Multilink expects that its operating results will fluctuate
substantially in the future and could continue to decline. Multilinks revenues were significantly lower and loss per share was significantly greater in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2001. Future declines 



in revenues and increased losses may be caused by a number of factors, many of which are outside Multilinks control. Factors that could negatively
affect Multilinks future operating results include the following: 



a continuing downturn in the telecommunications industry; 



lower demand for Multilinks products and its customers products; 



the failure of Multilinks corporate realignment plan; 



the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by Multilinks customers or prospective customers; 



general communications and semiconductor industry conditions; 



the amounts and timing of investments in research and development; 



competitive pressures on selling prices and the loss of customers; 



Multilinks ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis; 



the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns; 



the ability of Multilinks customers to obtain components from their other suppliers; and 



general economic conditions. 

Any of the above-mentioned factors could have a material adverse effect on Multilinks business and on its financial results. 

In the past, Multilink has recorded significant new product and process
development costs because its policy is to expense these costs at the time that they are incurred. Multilink may incur these types of expenses in the future. These additional expenses will have a material and adverse effect on Multilinks
results in future periods. 

The market price for Multilinks Class A
common stock has declined substantially and could continue to decline. 

Multilinks stock price has declined significantly in the context of announcements made by Multilink and other semiconductor suppliers of reduced revenues, declining operating performance, reduced expectations
and a significant slowdown in the technology sector, particularly the optical networking equipment sector. Given these general economic conditions and the reduced demand for Multilinks products that it has experienced, Multilink expects that
its stock price will continue to be volatile and could decline further. In addition, the value of Multilink could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors, among others, upon the market price of the Multilink Class A common stock:



additional declines in Multilinks revenues and continued increased losses; 



additional changes in financial analysts estimates of Multilinks revenues and earnings (losses); 



Multilinks failure to meet financial analysts performance expectations; and 



changes in market valuations of other companies in the semiconductor or fiber optic equipment industries. 

In addition, many of the risks described elsewhere in this section could materially and adversely affect Multilinks
stock price, as discussed in those risk factors. The stock markets have recently experienced substantial price and volume volatility. Fluctuations such as these have affected and are likely to continue to affect the market price of Multilinks
Class A common stock. 

In the past, securities class action
litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of such companies securities. If instituted against Multilink, regardless of the outcome, such litigation could result in
substantial costs and diversion of Multilink managements 



attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on Multilinks business, financial condition and results of operations. Multilink could be
required to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages, if it were to lose such a lawsuit. 

Multilinks reverse stock split may adversely affect the market price of its stock. 

On September 5, 2002, Multilinks board of directors authorized, and Multilinks shareholders approved, an amendment to Multilinks
articles of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split for the purpose of increasing the market price of the Multilink Class A common stock above the Nasdaq minimum of $1.00 and avoiding delisting of Multilink Class A common stock from The Nasdaq
National Market. Under the amendment, each outstanding ten shares of Multilink Class A common stock and Class B common stock were converted into one share of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable. The effective date of the
reverse split was September 6, 2002. 

The long-term effect of
the reverse stock split upon the market prices for the Multilink Class A common stock cannot be accurately predicted. In particular, there is no assurance that prices for shares of the Class A common stock after the reverse stock split will return
to or maintain levels higher than the prices for shares of the Class A common stock immediately prior to the reverse stock split. Moreover, because some investors may view the reverse stock split negatively, there can be no assurance that the
reverse stock split has not and will not continue to adversely impact the market price of the Multilink Class A common stock. 

The Multilink Class A common stock may still be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. 

Despite the completion of our reverse stock split, if the closing bid price for the Class A common stock is less than $1.00
per share during thirty consecutive trading days, Multilink may not qualify for continued inclusion of the Class A common stock on The Nasdaq National Market, and the Multilink Class A common stock could be delisted. Additionally, there are other
requirements for continued listing, in particular the requirement that Multilink maintains a public float of at least $5 million, that could also cause the Multilink Class A common stock to be delisted. If a delisting were to occur, the
Multilink Class A common stock may trade on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market, on the OTC Bulletin Board, or in the pink sheets maintained by the National Quotation Bureau, likely adversely affecting its liquidity. In addition, some
institutional investors have internal policies preventing the purchase of stocks trading on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the OTC Bulletin Board, or the pink sheets, which could also negatively affect the marketability of the Multilink
Class A common stock. Accordingly, if the Multilink Class A common stock was no longer to trade on The Nasdaq National Market, its market price could be adversely impacted. 

Declining activity in the build-out of the communications infrastructure and uncertainties in network service providers purchasing
programs, as well as consolidation in the network service provider industry, may adversely affect Multilinks future business and operating results. 

Multilinks business prospects depend substantially on the continued build-out of the communications infrastructure. Almost all telecommunication
service providers have curtailed the level of their capital expenditures on their infrastructure build-out, which has significantly reduced the demand for Multilinks products by communications equipment manufacturers. This slowdown has caused
Multilinks revenues and backlog to decline substantially. Multilinks revenues declined in each quarter of 2002, compared to the comparable periods in 2001 and further declined in the first quarter of 2003 as compared to the fourth
quarter of 2002. In addition, network service providers typically purchase network equipment pursuant to multi-year purchasing programs that may increase or decrease on a monthly basis as the providers adjust their capital equipment budgets and
purchasing priorities. Network service providers further curtailment or termination of purchasing programs or decreases in capital budgets could materially and adversely affect Multilinks revenue and business prospects. This is
particularly true if such curtailments, terminations or decreases are significant and unanticipated by Multilinks communications equipment manufacturer customers and Multilink. Additionally, consolidation among network service providers may
cause delays in the purchase of Multilinks products and a 



reexamination of strategic and purchasing decisions by these network service providers and Multilinks current and potential communications equipment
manufacturer customers, including delaying the expansion of 10 Gb/s systems and the migration to 40 Gb/s systems, which could harm Multilinks business and financial condition. 

Multilink may not immediately benefit from a recovery in the communications equipment industry. 

Multilinks industry is currently experiencing a significant and
prolonged downturn due to a corresponding downturn in the communications equipment industry. As noted above, this downturn could continue for some time. Multilink expects to be positively affected when the communications equipment industry recovers.
Many of Multilinks customers, however, may have significant inventory on hand and a recovery in the communications equipment industry, when it occurs, may not benefit Multilink in the short or intermediate term. Multilinks customers will
first utilize their current inventory levels before placing orders with Multilink. If Multilinks customers or potential customers are maintaining a substantial amount of inventory, it may take a significant period of time before Multilink
benefits from an improvement in the communications equipment industry. Multilink attempts to estimate inventory levels at its customers, but it cannot ensure that such estimates are materially accurate. 

Multilink must incur substantial research and development expenses. If Multilink does not
have sufficient resources to invest in research and development, its business would be seriously harmed. 

In order to remain competitive, Multilink must continue to make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products.
Multilink cannot assure you that it will have sufficient resources to invest in the development of new and enhanced technologies and competitive products. Multilinks failure to continue to make sufficient investments in research and
development programs could further significantly reduce its revenue and harm its business. Additionally, Multilinks products have a short life cycle; therefore, it has limited time to capitalize upon its research and development investments
and generate revenues. Multilink cannot assure you that its research and development investments will result in revenues in excess of its expenses, if at all, or will result in any commercially accepted products. 

A few customers account for a majority of Multilinks sales, and the loss of one or
more key customers could significantly reduce Multilinks cash flows, revenues and operating results. 

A relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a majority of Multilinks revenues. Multilinks three largest customers
accounted for approximately 54% of Multilinks revenues for fiscal year 2002, 71% of Multilinks revenues in 2001, and 53% of Multilinks revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2003. Multilinks top three customers for the
quarter ended March 31, 2003 were Lucent, ADVA and Cisco, representing approximately 36%, 9% and 8% of Multilinks revenues, respectively. Multilinks top three customers for the year ended December 31, 2002 were TyCom, Alcatel and Lucent,
representing approximately 25%, 19% and 10% of Multilinks revenues, respectively. Multilinks top three customers in 2001 were TyCom, Alcatel and Marconi, representing approximately 34%, 29% and 8% of Multilinks revenues,
respectively. Multilink anticipates that relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers or the loss of one or more key
customers in any period could significantly reduce Multilinks already declining revenues. 

Multilinks industry is subject to consolidation. 

There has been a trend toward consolidation among companies in Multilinks industry for several years. Multilink expects this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as communications integrated circuit
companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets. Consolidation may result in stronger competitors, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Multilinks business, operating results, and financial
condition. There has also been consolidation among communication equipment manufacturers, which could reduce the quantity of systems into which Multilink could sell, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Multilinks business.



Multilink sells substantially all of its products based on individual purchase orders, and Multilink cannot predict
the size or timing of its orders. Multilinks failure to effectively plan production levels and inventory could materially harm its business and operating results. 

Multilink sells substantially all of its products based on individual purchase orders, rather than long-term contracts. As a
result, its customers generally can cancel or reschedule orders on short notice and are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of any product. For example, Multilink had significant order cancellations during 2001. Multilink cannot assure
you that its existing customers will continue to place orders with Multilink, that orders by existing customers will be repeated at current levels or that Multilink will be able to obtain orders from new customers. Multilink cannot predict the size,
timing or terms of incoming purchase orders; therefore, decreases in the number or size of orders or the development of customer orders with new terms may adversely affect its business and operating results. 

Because Multilink does have substantial non-cancelable backlog, it typically
plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand that are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. In anticipation of long lead times to obtain certain inventory and materials, Multilink orders
materials in advance of anticipated customer sales. This advance ordering might result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if Multilinks customers cancel orders or change the specifications for their orders. If
Multilink is unable to plan inventory and production levels effectively, its business and operating results could be materially harmed. 

Multilink competes in highly competitive markets, against competitors with longer operating histories, greater name recognition, greater resources or larger market
capitalization. Multilinks failure to compete effectively would harm its business. 

The markets in which Multilink competes are highly competitive. Multilinks ability to compete successfully in its markets depends on a number of factors, including: 



product time-to-market; 



product performance; 



product price; 



product quality; product reliability; 



success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies; 



market acceptance of competitors products; 



efficiency of production; 



expansion of production of Multilinks products for particular systems manufacturers; and 



customer support and reputation. 

Multilink competes primarily against Agere, Applied Micro Circuits, Broadcom, Infineon, JDS Uniphase, Maxim, Mindspeed (a Conexant company), NEL, Nortel
(microelectronics division), NTT Electronics, Philips, PMC-Sierra, Transwitch, Vitesse and various start-ups. Many of Multilinks competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and a greater presence in
key markets, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, distribution, technical and other resources. As a result, Multilinks competitors may be able to adapt more quickly
to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. In addition, Multilinks competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address the
transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at a lower cost, thereby rendering Multilinks products obsolete. Multilinks competitors that have large market capitalization or cash reserves are 



also better positioned than Multilink is to acquire other companies, thereby obtaining new technologies or products. Any of these acquisitions could give
Multilinks competitors a strategic advantage that could adversely affect Multilinks business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these competitors resources place them in a stronger position to weather a
continued downturn in Multilinks industry. 

Current and
potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances
forged by competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. 

Multilink incurs research and development expenses in advance of obtaining access to emerging process technology, and as a result, these investments may not result in the production of any marketable products. 

Multilink often incurs substantial research and development expenses for the
development of products incorporating emerging process technologies. Multilink makes these substantial investments in the product design stage and prior to gaining access to these process technologies. Failure to gain access to these process
technologies could prevent Multilinks products development and commercialization and materially harm Multilinks business. 

Multilinks future success depends in part on strategic relationships with certain of its customers. If Multilink cannot maintain these relationships or if these
customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitors solutions instead of buying Multilinks products, Multilinks operating results would be adversely affected. 

In the past, Multilink has relied on its strategic relationships with
certain customers who are technology leaders in Multilinks target markets. Multilink intends to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but cannot assure you that it will be able to do so. These relationships
often require Multilink to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges. Multilinks partners frequently place considerable pressure on it to meet their tight development schedules. Accordingly, Multilink may
have to devote a substantial amount of its limited resources to its strategic relationships, which could detract from or delay its completion of other important development projects. Delays in development could impair Multilinks relationships
with its strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that Multilinks customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitors solution for products that they
currently buy from Multilink. If that happens, Multilinks business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Multilink will lose customer sales and may not be successful if customers and prospective customers do not qualify Multilinks
products to be designed into their systems. 

Because
Multilinks products must function as part of a larger system or network, Multilinks customers often undertake extensive qualification processes prior to placing large product orders. Once communications equipment manufacturers decide to
use a particular suppliers products or components, they incorporate those products or components into their system design, which are known as design-wins. Suppliers who fail to achieve design-wins are unlikely to make sales to those customers
for particular projects until at least the adoption of future redesigned systems. Even then, many companies may be reluctant to incorporate entirely new products into their new system designs, as this could involve significant additional redesign
efforts. If Multilink fails to achieve design-wins it will lose the opportunity for sales to those customers for a lengthy period of time. Although a design-win increases the likelihood that Multilinks products will be incorporated into the
systems of its customers or prospective customers, it does not obligate that customer or prospective customer to purchase specified quantities of Multilinks products. 



Multilinks success is dependent upon its ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.

Multilinks operating results will depend largely on
its ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. Successful product development and introduction depends on numerous factors, including, among others: 



Multilinks ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards; 



Multilinks ability to accurately define new products; 



Multilinks ability to timely complete development of new products and bring its products to market on a timely basis; 



Multilinks ability to differentiate its products from offerings of its competitors; 



Multilinks ability to understand overall system and network architecture; and 



overall market acceptance of Multilinks products. 

Furthermore, Multilink is required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based
on its expectations of future market growth. Multilink cannot assure you that it will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that its products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve
market acceptance, or that it will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. Multilink also cannot assure you that it will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors.

In addition, prices of established products may decline,
sometimes significantly, over time. Multilink believes that in order to remain competitive, it must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that it develops and introduces new or enhanced products.
Multilink cannot assure you that it will be able to continue to reduce the cost of its products to remain competitive. 

The markets Multilink serves are subject to rapid technological change, and if Multilink is unable to develop and introduce new products, Multilinks revenues
could decline further. 

The markets Multilink serves
frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Products for communications applications, as well as for high-speed computing applications, are based on
continually evolving industry standards. A significant portion of Multilinks revenues in recent periods has been, and is expected to continue to be, derived from sales of products based on existing transmission standards. Multilinks
ability to compete in the future will, however, depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. 

The emergence of new industry standards could render Multilinks products incompatible with products developed by major communications equipment
manufacturers. If Multilinks products are unable to support the new features, the enhanced integration of functions or the performance levels required by communications equipment manufacturers in these markets, Multilink would likely lose
business from an existing or potential customer. Moreover, Multilink would not have the opportunity to compete for new business until the next product transition occurs. As a result, Multilink could be required to invest significant time and effort
and to incur significant expense to redesign its products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If Multilinks products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, Multilink could miss
opportunities to achieve crucial design-wins. 

Moreover, to
improve the cost-effectiveness and performance of its products, Multilink may be required to transition one or more of its products to process technologies with smaller components, other materials or higher speeds. Multilink may not be able to
improve its process technologies and develop or otherwise gain access to 



new process technologies in a timely or cost-effective manner. Multilink could record expenses or charges associated with such a transition. For example,
Multilink wrote off $4.3 million of inventory in the first quarter of 2001, which resulted from a transition from certain GaAs products to SiGe products and an order cancellation, reducing Multilinks gross profit. Customers may be inclined to
purchase 0.13um CMOS technologies rather than products that incorporate SiGe, GaAs or InP processes because of lower power requirements and lower cost. 

These risks may lead to increased costs or delay product delivery, which would harm Multilinks revenues and customer relationships. Consequently,
Multilinks revenues could be reduced for a substantial period if Multilink fails to develop products with required features or performance standards, if Multilink experiences a delay as short as a few months in bringing a new product to
market, or if Multilinks customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products. 

Necessary licenses of third-party technology may not be available to Multilink or may be prohibitively expensive, which could adversely affect Multilinks ability to produce and sell its products.

From time to time Multilink may be required to license
technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Multilink cannot assure you that third-party licenses will be available to it on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Multilinks inability to obtain any
third-party license required to develop new products and product enhancements could require it to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, if at all, any of which could seriously harm its ability to
sell its products. 

Multilinks future success depends on the continued
service of its engineering, technical and key management personnel, and Multilinks failure to retain such personnel would be harmful to its ongoing operations and business prospects. 

Multilink may not be able to continue to retain engineers or other qualified
personnel necessary for the development of its products and business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave Multilink in the future. Loss of the services of engineers or other technical and key management personnel could
be significantly detrimental to Multilinks product and process development programs and adversely affect its business and operating results. 

Multilinks future success depends in part on the continued service of its key executives, and the loss of any of these key executives could adversely affect
Multilinks business and operating results. 

Multilinks success depends in part upon the continued service of its executive officers, particularly Dr. Richard Nottenburg, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Dr. Nottenburg does not have an employment
or non-competition agreement with Multilink. The loss of Dr. Nottenburg would be detrimental to Multilinks ongoing operations and prospects. In August 2002, Eric Pillmore, Multilinks Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial
Officer, resigned to pursue other opportunities. In November 2002, Joseph Cole, Multilinks Vice President of Worldwide Sales, and Ronald Krisanda, Multilinks Senior Vice President of Operations, resigned to pursue other opportunities.
Dr. Jens Albers, Multilinks Executive Vice President and Co-Chairman of the Board, retired from his full-time duties as an officer and director in August 2002 and left Multilink to pursue other opportunities in December 2002. Effective May
2003, Richard Mannherz, Multilinks Vice President of Worldwide Sales, left Multilink to pursue other opportunities. While Multilink has replaced Mr. Pillmore and reassigned Dr. Albers, Mr. Coles Mr. Krisandas
responsibilities to other members of management, Multilinks future success will depend in part on how effectively it can carry out its business plan in their absence. 



Several of Multilinks key personnel are relatively new to their positions and must be integrated into
Multilinks organization. Multilinks failure to integrate these individuals could adversely affect Multilinks business. 

Several of Multilinks key personnel have recently been promoted to their current positions, including John U. Soenksen, who was promoted to his
current position of Chief Financial Officer in August 2002. Therefore, in combination with the executive departures described above, there has been little or no opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of Multilinks current executive
management team as a combined unit. Multilinks future performance will depend in part on its ability to successfully integrate its newly appointed officers and key personnel into its management team, and its ability to develop an effective
working relationship among management. 

Multilinks failure to protect
its intellectual property adequately could adversely affect its business, and patents obtained by Multilinks competitors may preclude Multilink from certain product development. 

Multilinks intellectual property is critical to its ability to
successfully design products for the optical networking systems market. Multilink cannot assure you that its pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved. Further, Multilink cannot assure you that any issued patents will
provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that if challenged, will be found to be valid or enforceable. Additionally, Multilink cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect
on its ability to do business. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate Multilinks products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to Multilink. 

Multilink relies on the combination of maskwork protection under the
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property. Despite these efforts, Multilink cannot be certain
that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to Multilinks intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual property, or that Multilink can meaningfully protect its
intellectual property. 

Multilink could be harmed by litigation involving
patents and proprietary rights. 

The semiconductor
industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Multilink may be accused of infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. Additionally, Multilink has indemnification
obligations to its customers with respect to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties. Such intellectual property infringement claims by third parties or indemnification claims by Multilinks customers could harm its business.

Any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of
third parties, whether or not determined in Multilinks favor or settled by Multilink, could be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of its management and technical personnel. In the event of any adverse ruling in any litigation,
Multilink could be required to: 



pay substantial damages; 



cease the manufacturing, use and sale of certain products; 



discontinue the use of certain process technologies; and 



obtain a license from the third-party claiming infringement, which might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Multilinks operating results are subject to fluctuations because of sales to foreign
customers. 

International sales accounted for
approximately 33% of Multilinks revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, 17% of Multilinks revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 24% of Multilinks revenues in 



2001. International sales will continue to account for a significant portion of Multilinks revenues, and as a result, Multilink will be subject to
certain risks associated with international sales, including: 



changes in regulatory requirements; 



increases in tariffs and other trade barriers; 



timing and availability of export licenses; 



political and economic instability, including war and acts of terrorism; 



difficulties in accounts receivable collections; 



difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations; 



difficulties in managing distributors; 



difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products; 



foreign currency exchange fluctuations; 



the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties; and 



potentially adverse tax consequences. 

Multilink is subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology
products. Multilink cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of its products will be implemented by the United States or other countries. Some of Multilinks customer
purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from U.S. laws. Therefore, Multilink may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded.

Because sales of Multilinks products are denominated in
U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of Multilinks products so that they become more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales and
profitability in that country. Future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales. Gains and losses on the conversion to U.S. dollars of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and
liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in Multilinks results of operations. 

If Multilink becomes subject to unfair hiring claims, Multilink could incur substantial costs in defending itself, or Multilinks managements attention
could be diverted away from its operations. 

Companies in
Multilinks industry often hire individuals formerly employed by their competitors. In such cases, these competitors frequently claim that the hiring company has engaged in unfair hiring practices. Multilink has received claims of this kind in
the past from its competitors, and Multilink cannot assure you that it will not receive claims of this kind in the future or that those claims will not result in material litigation. Multilink could incur substantial costs in defending itself or its
employees against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In addition, defending itself from such claims could divert the attention of Multilinks management away from its operations. 

Multilinks dependence on third-party manufacturing and supply relationships could
negatively impact the production of Multilinks products and significantly harm its business. 

Multilink does not own or operate manufacturing facilities necessary for the production of most of its products. Multilink relies on several outside
foundries and other outsource partners for the manufacture and assembly of most of its products, and Multilink expects this to continue for the foreseeable future. Finding alternative sources for these products will result in substantial delays in
production and additional costs. 



Multilinks dependence upon third parties that manufacture, assemble, package or supply components
for its products may result in: 



lack of assured semiconductor wafer supply and reduced control over delivery schedules and quality; 



the unavailability of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; 



limited control over manufacturing yields and quality assurance; 



inadequate capacity during periods of excess demand; 



inadequate allocation of production capacity to meet Multilinks needs; 



increased costs of materials or manufacturing services; 



difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors; 



limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to Multilink; 



inability to take advantage of price reductions; and 



misappropriation of Multilinks intellectual property. 

Any one of these factors could adversely affect Multilinks business. 

While Multilink believes it has good relations with its outside foundries and suppliers, it cannot be certain that it will
be able to maintain these favorable relations. Additionally, because there are a limited number of foundries and suppliers that can produce Multilinks products, establishing relationships and increasing production with new outside foundries
takes a considerable amount of time. Thus, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for Multilinks production needs. A manufacturing disruption, such as a raw material shortage, experienced by any of Multilinks outside
foundries and suppliers could impact the production of some of Multilinks products for a substantial period of time. Multilinks outside foundries and suppliers inability to increase their production capacity or to continue to
allocate capacity to manufacture Multilinks components could also limit Multilinks ability to grow its business. 

In addition, Multilinks internal manufacturing operations, though limited, are complex and subject to disruption due to causes beyond
Multilinks control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities, errors in any
step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer not to function. 

Multilink may face production delays if the subcontractors it uses to manufacture its
wafers or products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet Multilinks demands or fail to advance the process technologies needed to manufacture Multilinks products. 

Multilinks wafer and product requirements represent a small portion of
the total production of the third-party foundries that manufacture Multilinks products. As a result, Multilink is subject to the risk that its external foundries may not continue to devote resources to the continued development and improvement
of the process technologies on which the manufacturing of Multilinks products are based. This could increase Multilinks costs and harm its ability to deliver its products on time. 

Multilinks operating results substantially depend on manufacturing output and
yields, which may not meet expectations. 

Manufacturing
semiconductors requires manufacturing tools that are unique to each product produced. If one of these unique manufacturing tools of Multilinks outside foundries were damaged or destroyed, then the 



ability of these foundries to manufacture the related product would be impaired and Multilinks business would suffer. In addition, Multilinks
manufacturing yields decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or significant portions of each wafer are nonfunctional. Such declines can be caused by many factors, including minute levels of contaminants in the
manufacturing environment, design imperfections, defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer and difficulties in the fabrication process. Many of these problems are difficult to diagnose, are time consuming and expensive to remedy and can
result in shipment delays. 

Difficulties associated with
adapting Multilinks technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of Multilinks outside foundries can lead to reduced yields. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology
failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield
problems may require cooperation between Multilink and its manufacturers. In some cases this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of some of Multilinks manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify,
communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Manufacturing defects that Multilink does not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls. Difficulties in diagnosing and solving the complicated
problems of assembling these types of semiconductors could also reduce Multilinks yields. 

If Multilink is unable to commit to deliver sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy its customers needs, it may be difficult for Multilink to attract new orders and customers or it may lose current
orders and customers. 

Multilinks customers
typically require that it commit to provide specified quantities of products over a given period of time. Multilink may be unable to deliver sufficient quantities of its products for any of the following reasons: 



Multilinks reliance on third-party manufacturers; 



Multilinks limited infrastructure, including personnel and systems; 



the limited availability of raw materials; 



competing customer demands; and 



transportation. 

If Multilink is unable to commit to deliver sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy a customers anticipated needs, Multilink may lose the
order and the opportunity for significant sales to that customer and may be unable to attract new orders and customers. 

Multilinks products are incorporated into sophisticated systems, and defects may be discovered only after full deployment, which could seriously harm
Multilinks business. 

Multilinks products are
complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across sophisticated networks. Because of the nature of Multilinks products, they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic.
Multilinks customers may discover errors or defects in Multilinks products, or Multilinks products may not operate as expected, after they have been fully deployed. If Multilinks products have defects or do not operate as
expected, Multilink could experience: 



loss of, or delay in, revenues and loss of market share; 



loss of existing customers; 



failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance for its products; 



diversion of development resources; 





increased service and warranty costs; 



legal actions by its customers; 



increased insurance costs; and 



damage to its reputation and customer relationships. 

The occurrence of any of these problems could seriously harm Multilinks business and result in decreased revenues and increased operating expenses.
Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in Multilinks products could result in financial or other damages to Multilinks customers or could negatively affect market acceptance for Multilinks products. 

Multilinks business depends on the continued availability of raw materials and
advanced process technologies at reasonable prices. If adequate amounts of raw materials or advanced process technologies are unavailable, Multilinks operating results would be adversely affected. 

Highly specialized raw materials and advanced process technologies are
needed for the production of Multilinks products. In some cases, there are only two or three suppliers of such materials and technologies in the world. Multilink depends on the continued availability of these materials and technologies at
reasonable prices. Multilink may not be able to fulfill customer purchase requests if there is a substantial increase in the price for these materials or if its outside suppliers cannot provide adequate quantities of raw materials for the production
of its products. This may result in decreased revenues and adversely affect Multilinks operating results. 

Multilink has made, and may make, investments in development stage companies which may not produce any returns for Multilink in the future. 

Multilink has made investments in early stage venture-backed, start-up
companies that develop technologies that are complementary to Multilinks product roadmap. The following table summarizes these investments as of March 31, 2003: 

Investee Company

Initial Investment Date

Technology

ASIP, Inc.

July 2000

Integrated photonics components for advanced fiber optics communications networks

Internet Machines Corporation

October 2000

Integrated photonics components for advanced fiber optic communications networks

Innovative Processing AG

August 2001

Components and services for high-speed and high-bandwidth networks for the telecom and datacom markets

Multilinks total
investment in these companies was approximately $3.7 million at December 31, 2001. During fiscal 2002, Multilink did not make any additional investments in these companies and recognized equity losses totaling $0.7 million and asset impairments
totaling $2.5 million bringing Multilinks total investment balance in these companies to $0.5 million at December 31, 2002. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, Multilink did not make any additional investments in these companies and
recognized an asset impairment on its investment in Innovative Processing AG for $0.3 million, bringing Multilinks total investment balance in these companies to $0.2 million. These investments involve all the risks normally associated with
investments in development stage companies. As such, there can be no assurance that Multilink will receive a favorable return on these or any future venture-backed investments that Multilink may make. Additionally, Multilinks original 



and any future investments may continue to become impaired if these companies do not succeed in the execution of their business plans. Any further impairment
or equity losses in these investments could negatively impact Multilinks future operating results. 

The communications industry is subject to U.S. and foreign government regulations that could harm Multilinks business. Multilinks failure to timely comply with regulatory requirements, or obtain and
maintain regulatory approvals, could materially harm Multilinks business. 

The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry in the United States and, as a result, Multilinks products and Multilinks customers products
are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Current and future FCC rules and regulations affecting communications services, Multilinks products or Multilinks customers businesses or products could negatively affect Multilinks
business. In addition, international regulatory standards could impair Multilinks ability to develop products in the future. Delays caused by Multilinks compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or
cancellations of product orders, which would harm Multilinks business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, Multilink cannot be certain that it will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that
may, in the future, be required to operate its business. 

Multilinks
business is subject to environmental regulations. 

Multilink is subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile and other hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process. If Multilink fails to comply with these regulations, this failure could result in the
imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of Multilinks operations. Additionally, Multilink may be restricted in its ability to expand operations at our present locations, or Multilink may be required to incur significant expenses
to comply with these regulations. 

Certain of Multilinks directors,
executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of Multilinks shareholders, and accordingly Multilink will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval.

Multilink currently has approximately 5,100,000 shares of
Class A common stock outstanding, with each share entitling the holder to one vote. Multilink currently has 2,600,000 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes. All of the Class B common stock is held
by officers, directors or other persons or entities owning 5% or more of the total voting control held by Multilinks shareholders. 

Multilinks executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 50% of Multilinks outstanding common stock and
over 50% of the total voting control held by Multilinks shareholders. In particular, Dr. Richard Nottenburg, as a result of his stock ownership and a voting trust agreement with Dr. Jens Albers, alone controls approximately 50% of the
outstanding voting power of Multilinks capital stock. In addition, persons and entities owning more than 5% of Multilinks outstanding shares of common stock, in the aggregate, control over 90% of the outstanding voting power of
Multilinks capital stock. As a result, Multilinks directors and 5% shareholders acting together have the ability to control all matters submitted to Multilinks shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of
directors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of Multilinks assets. These shareholders may make decisions that are adverse to the interests of Multilinks other shareholders. 

If a significant number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period
of time, the market price of Multilinks stock could further decline. 

Multilink had, as of March 31, 2003, 2.2 million shares subject to vested but unexercised options and warrants which may currently be exercised and sold in the public market. If Multilinks shareholders now sell



substantial amounts of Multilinks common stock in the public markets, the market price of the Multilink Class A common stock could be materially
adversely affected. 

In addition, under certain investors
rights agreements, some of Multilinks current shareholders have demand and/or piggyback registration rights in connection with future offerings of Multilinks common stock. Demand rights enable
shareholders to demand that their shares be registered and may require Multilink to file a registration statement under the Securities Act at Multilinks expense. Piggyback rights require Multilink to notify the shareholders of its
stock if it proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act, and grant such shareholders the right to include their shares in the registration statement. Registration of these additional shares would make them generally available
to be sold in the public market. 

Multilinks board of directors may
issue, without shareholder approval, shares of preferred stock that have rights and preferences superior to those of Multilinks shares of common stock and that may prevent or delay a change of control. 

Multilinks articles of incorporation provide that Multilinks
board of directors may issue new shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Some of the rights and preferences of these shares of preferred stock would be superior to the rights and preferences of shares of Multilinks common
stock. Accordingly, the issuance of new shares of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of Multilinks common stock. In addition, the issuance of new shares of preferred stock may prevent or delay a change of
control of Multilink. 



THE MULTILINK TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place 

The Multilink special
meeting will be held on August 19, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, at the offices of Multilink located at 300 Atrium Drive, Somerset, New Jersey 08873. 

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

Multilink is furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to Multilink shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies from Multilink
shareholders for use at the Multilink special meeting. Vitesse also is furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to Multilink shareholders as a prospectus in connection with the issuance by Vitesse of shares of Vitesse common stock in the merger.

At the special meeting, and any adjournment of the special
meeting, Multilink shareholders will be asked: 



to consider and vote on a proposal to approve an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 9, 2003, among Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, Margaux Acquisition Corporation, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Vitesse, and Multilink, and the merger and other transactions contemplated thereby; and 



to transact such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. 

Board of Directors Recommendation 

The Multilink board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommends a vote FOR approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. 

Record Date and Outstanding Shares 

The Multilink board of directors has fixed July 15, 2003 as the record date for the special meeting. Accordingly, only shareholders of record of Multilink
common stock at the close of business on July 15, 2003 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On such date, 5,274,000 shares of Multilink Class A common stock, par value $.0001 per share, were issued and outstanding, and
2,600,000 shares of Multilink Class B common stock, par value $.0001 per share, were issued and outstanding. No shares of Multilink preferred stock were outstanding on the record date. 

Voting; Quorum 

Holders of Multilinks Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote as separate classes at the special
meeting on the merger proposal, and as a single class on all other matters, with each holder of Class A common stock entitled to one vote per share held and each holder of Class B common stock entitled to ten votes per share held. 

The presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, of holders
of shares of outstanding common stock entitled to vote and representing a majority of the voting power of each class of such shares shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions and shares held by brokers that are present in
person or represented by proxy but that are not voted because the brokers were prohibited from exercising discretionary authority, known as broker non-votes, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present for the
transaction of business. The proposal to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Class A common stock and the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of the Class B common stock, voting as separate classes. As a result, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as 



negative votes on this proposal. All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting, who will separately tabulate
affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. 

The stock transfer books of will remain open between the record date and the date of the special meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at Multilinks executive offices.

Voting Agreements 

As of June 9, 2003, certain Multilink shareholders, including certain
officers and directors of Multilink, entered into voting agreements pursuant to which, among other things, they agreed to vote their shares of Multilink stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. Copies of
the voting agreements are attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. Each of these Multilink shareholders has also granted an irrevocable proxy and a power of attorney to Vitesse representatives to vote his, her or its shares of
Multilink common stock FOR adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. As of the record date for the Special Meeting, the Multilink shareholders that are parties to the voting agreements collectively owned and were
entitled to vote approximately 43.0% of the outstanding shares of Multilink Class A common stock and 78.9% of the outstanding shares of Multilink Class B common stock. 

Proxies and Revocability of Proxies 

Should you receive more than one proxy because your shares are registered in different names or addresses, please be sure to sign, date and return each
proxy to assure that all of your shares will be voted. Only proxies that have been signed, dated and timely returned will be counted in the quorum and voted. If the enclosed form of proxy is properly signed and returned, the shares represented
thereby will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If the proxy does not specify how the shares represented thereby are to be voted, the proxy will be voted FOR the merger proposal.

You may revoke or change your proxy at any time before the
special meeting by filing a notice of revocation or another signed proxy with a later date with the corporate secretary of Multilink at Multilinks principal executive offices, located at 300 Atrium Drive, Somerset, New Jersey 08873. If you
attend the special meeting and vote by ballot, your proxy will be revoked automatically and only your vote at the special meeting will be counted. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct such institution
how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or bank, which indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or discretionary authority to vote on the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker or bank. 

Because approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Class A common stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the record date,
abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record
by a broker, bank or other nominee, you will not be able to vote in person at the special meeting unless you have obtained and present a proxy issued in your name from the record holder.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses 

Multilink and Vitesse will share equally the fees and costs, except
attorneys and accountants fees, of filing and printing this proxy statement/prospectus. Multilink will bear all attorneys and accountants fees incurred by 



it in connection with filing and printing this proxy statement/prospectus and will pay the cost of soliciting proxies from its shareholders. In addition to
solicitation by mail, Multilinks directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, fax, e-mail, telegram or in person. 

Please do not send stock certificates with your proxy card. A transmittal form with instructions concerning the surrender of Multilink stock certificates
will be mailed to you by Vitesses exchange agent as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Other Business and Adjournments 

Multilink is not currently aware of any business other than the merger proposal to be acted upon at the Multilink special meeting of shareholders. If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the special meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion to vote or act on those matters in accordance with their best judgment, including any proposal to adjourn the
special meeting; provided, however, that a proxy voted against the merger proposal will not be voted in favor of adjournment of the special meeting. 

Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval
of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without further notice other than by an announcement at the special meeting. If the adjournment is
for more than 45 days or a new record date is fixed for the adjourned special meeting, a notice of the adjourned special meeting will be given to each Multilink shareholder entitled to vote at the special meeting. Multilink does not currently intend
to seek an adjournment of its special meeting unless such an adjournment is necessary to solicit additional votes. 

Rights to Dissent and Appraisal 

Holders of Multilink Class B common stock and certain holders of Multilink Class A common stock are entitled to dissent from the proposed merger and
demand appraisal of their shares of Multilink common stock. If your shares satisfy the criteria as dissenting shares under Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California and you wish to dissent, you must follow the specific
procedures set forth in the General Corporation Law of California, as described in detail in the section titled California Dissenters Rights on page 55. The full text of the relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of
California is also attached as Annex D. 

To assure that your
shares are represented at the meeting, please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy and mail it promptly in the postage-paid envelope provided, whether or not you plan to attend the meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank or
broker, you may be able to vote by telephone or over the Internet, as described on the enclosed proxy card. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted. 



THE MERGER 

This section of
the proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
You should carefully read this entire document and the other documents we referred to for a more complete understanding of the merger. 

Background of the merger 

During
2002, Multilink and its board of directors began considering various possible strategic alternatives for the future of Multilink. As part of its continuing review of Multilinks strategic plan, Multilinks board determined that a
combination with a larger entity in its sector could be an attractive alternative. 

In early March 2003, Richard Nottenburg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Multilink, approached Louis Tomasetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vitesse, regarding a potential business
combination between the two corporations involving a stock-for-stock acquisition of Multilink by Vitesse. Dr. Tomasetta expressed interest in Multilink, its technology and products, and in particular its focus on backplane interconnect circuits. He
indicated that Vitesse would consider a transaction only if there was a substantial reduction in Multilinks work force so as to not delay the timing of Vitesses stated target of attaining profitability. 

On March 11, 2003, at a regularly scheduled board meeting, the Multilink
board of directors met and discussed the potential transaction between Multilink and Vitesse. The Multilink board noted that Vitesse possessed skill sets and a product line complementary to those of Multilink. At this meeting, the Multilink board
formed a special committee of independent directors, composed of James Schneider and Edward Zander, to consider the potential acquisition of Multilink by Vitesse and related issues. The board also authorized Dr. Nottenburg and G. Bradford Jones, a
Multilink director, to engage in negotiations with Vitesse regarding the potential transaction and, should these discussions progress, to begin financial and legal due diligence. 

During the period from March 11, 2003 to March 26, 2003, Dr. Nottenburg and Mr. Jones of Multilink had several conversations
regarding the proposed merger, primarily focused on valuation, headcount targets and high-level integration issues, with Dr. Tomasetta and Eugene Hovanec, Vitesses Chief Financial Officer. During this period Dr. Tomasetta informally discussed
with the Vitesse board of directors the possibility of a transaction with Multilink, and kept them apprised of the status of his discussions with Dr. Nottenburg and Mr. Jones. 

On March 26, 2003, Dr. Nottenburg and Dr. Tomasetta discussed the potential valuation of the proposed transaction. The
parties agreed to continue with due diligence investigations and with negotiation of the terms of a merger agreement. 

On April 11, 2003 and April 12, 2003, Yatin Mody, Vice President of Finance of Vitesse, and Mr. Hovanec conducted financial due diligence meetings with
Dr. Nottenburg and other members of Multilink management at Multilinks Somerset, New Jersey headquarters. Multilink management made a series of presentations on the products, technology, sales and distribution strategy and financial results of
Multilink and responded to questions from Vitesse management. 

On April 17, 2003, at a regularly scheduled board meeting, the Vitesse board of directors discussed the possibility of acquiring Multilink. Dr. Tomasetta gave a presentation to the board regarding the potential transaction, and after
extensive discussion, the board authorized Dr. Tomasetta to engage in negotiations with Multilink and to continue the due diligence process. Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to Vitesse, began its legal due diligence review of Multilink shortly
after the meeting. 

At a special telephonic meeting of the
Multilink board of directors on April 23, 2003, Dr. Nottenburg and John Soenksen, Multilinks Chief Financial Officer, reported to the Multilink board of directors that Vitesse had 



substantially completed its financial due diligence with respect to Multilink, and that the reciprocal legal due diligence process between Multilink and
Vitesse was ongoing. At this meeting, the Multilink board approved a cash bonus of $300,000 to be paid to Mr. Nottenburg upon the successful completion of the proposed merger. 

At a special telephonic meeting of the special committee of the Multilink board of directors on April 29, 2003, the special
committee received an update from Allen Matkins Leck Gamble & Mallory LLP, or Allen Matkins, counsel to Multilink, regarding the status of the merger negotiations. Following this update, the special committee retained McKenna Long &
Aldridge, or McKenna, to represent the special committee and its members in connection with the proposed transaction. The committee also reviewed and discussed written presentations from investment banks that it was considering retaining for the
purpose of providing an opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration. 

On May 2, 2003, Davis Polk & Wardwell provided a draft merger agreement to Allen Matkins for purposes of finalizing the possible structure and
negotiating the terms of an acquisition of Multilink by Vitesse. 

At a special telephonic meeting of the special committee of the Multilink board of directors on May 6, 2003, the special committee received an update on the status of the merger agreement and the merger negotiations from McKenna and Allen
Matkins. After discussion, the special committee determined to meet with representatives of Chanin Capital L.L.C., or Chanin, to discuss the possibility of Chanins providing financial advisory services and rendering an opinion with respect to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of Multilink of the consideration to be received in the proposed merger. Following the May 6, 2003 special committee meeting, the Multilink special committee began working with Chanin
with respect to the potential transaction. 

From May 6 to May
14, 2003, discussions continued between executives and legal advisors of the two companies, and each companys CEO kept his board of directors apprised through informal communications. These discussions included consideration of the risks and
issues surrounding an acquisition, the terms of the acquisition, the roles of Multilinks management and employees after the acquisition, the compatibility of the two companies technology, products and culture and each companys
financial condition and operating results. Davis Polk & Wardwell and Allen Matkins exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and related agreements, negotiated the terms of these agreements and continued legal due diligence reviews. McKenna and
the special committee were furnished with copies of these drafts, and provided comments and suggestions during the drafting process. 

At a special telephonic meeting of the special committee of the Multilink board of directors on May 14, 2003, the special committee received a report on
the ongoing negotiations regarding the merger and the merger agreement. The special committee and McKenna provided additional comments regarding the merger agreement. At this meeting, the special committee also formally approved the engagement of
Chanin in connection with the proposed merger. This arrangement was formalized on May 19, 2003. 

Between May 20 and June 3, 2003, Davis Polk & Wardwell and Allen Matkins exchanged additional drafts of the merger agreement and related documents,
and negotiated terms including closing conditions, the termination provisions of the agreement, the circumstances under which Vitesse would be entitled to a break-up fee, and the terms of the voting agreements to be entered into by Multilink
shareholders. Davis Polk & Wardwell and Allen Matkins also completed their legal due diligence reviews. 

On June 3, 2003, the special committee, consisting of Messrs. Schneider and Zander, met telephonically and discussed the merger proposal and the terms of
the merger agreement. Representatives of Chanin rendered an oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date, the merger consideration to be offered to Multilinks shareholders in the merger
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Multilink Class A common stock and Class B common stock individually and as a whole (other than Vitesse or its subsidiaries). After an extensive discussion and considering such factors as
the fairness of the consideration to be paid to the shareholders of Multilink, the terms of the merger agreement and the other factors 



listed under The Merger Proposal  Multilinks Reasons for the Merger, the special committee determined that the merger was in the best
interests of Multilink and its shareholders and recommended that the Multilink board of directors approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 

On June 4, 2003, a quorum of the Multilink board of directors, with only Mr. Schneider absent, held a special meeting to
consider approval of the merger. The board of directors reviewed the terms of the definitive agreement with Allen Matkins and the resolution of previously outstanding matters. In addition, Allen Matkins updated its legal due diligence report.
Representatives of Chanin described their oral opinion, rendered to the Multilink special committee on June 3, 2003, regarding the fairness of the merger consideration to the Multilink shareholders. Mr. Zander reported that the special committee had
approved, and was recommending to the Multilink board of directors, that Multilink enter into the merger agreement and proceed with the transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly, after due consideration, receipt of the recommendation of the
special committee, and the other factors listed under The Merger Proposal  Multilinks Reasons for the Merger, the Multilink board members who were present unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and recommended that the Multilink shareholders approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the special meeting. This approval was subsequently unanimously reiterated in writing by the entire
Multilink board. 

On June 5, 2003, at a special telephonic
meeting, the Vitesse board of directors reviewed the terms of the definitive agreement, and considered the merger. After extensive discussion and due consideration, the Vitesse board of directors determined that the merger was in the best interests
of the stockholders of Vitesse and approved the merger and the definitive agreement. 

Between June 6 and June 9, 2003, Vitesse, Multilink and their respective advisors finalized the merger agreement and related documents in accordance with the authorization of each companys respective board of
directors. 

On June 9, 2003, after the close of the stock
market, the merger agreement and related agreements were executed. Vitesse issued a press release announcing the acquisition shortly after the closing of the stock market on June 9, 2003. 

Vitesses Reasons for the Merger 

The board of directors of Vitesse consulted with its management and determined that the merger and the merger agreement are in the best interests of Vitesse stockholders. In considering the merger, the board of directors found the following
factors and reasons to be the most important: 



Multilink will bring to Vitesse an experienced engineering team that possesses the skills required to pursue Vitesses product development plans for backplane interconnect
circuits with an increased focus. Historically, Vitesse has not had a business unit dedicated to this effort. Vitesse believes that this is an area that has significant market potential and a focused engineering team would help grow its revenues
from backplane interconnect products. 



The merger will provide Vitesse with several completed products that Vitesse was either developing or planning to develop, that would have required a significant outlay of
engineering resources as well as tooling, mask and wafer costs. 



Multilink uses similar design methodologies, software tools and wafer foundries as Vitesse, which is expected to facilitate integration of the design processes and the engineering
teams of the two companies. 



Vitesse and Multilink share several common customers, which is expected to bring additional synergies to the sales and marketing efforts of the combined companies.





Multilinks near-term financial projections indicate that its operating results after contemplated headcount reductions and facility closures will not have a material impact on
Vitesses operations. 



The merger should also result in an addition of approximately $8-12 million of cash, net of liabilities and commitments, to Vitesses balance sheet.

The Vitesse board of directors also considered a
number of potential risks related to the merger, including: 



the risk that the expected benefits of the merger may not be realized; 



the risk that Vitesse will not be able to retain key Multilink personnel; 



the risk that the Multilink cash reserves will become depleted before the merger is consummated; 



the risk that Multilinks products might not be successfully integrated into Vitesses own product line; and 



the other risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under Risk Factors. 

After carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed merger, the Vitesse board of directors
unanimously approved the merger.

Multilinks Reasons for the Merger 

Special Committee.
    In reaching its conclusion to unanimously recommend that the Multilink board of directors approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Multilink special
committee carefully considered a range of strategic alternatives, including the pursuit of a long-term independent business strategy for Multilink. The Multilink special committee also consulted with Multilink management and legal and financial
advisors to Multilink and the special committee during the period it was considering the merger. 

During the course of its deliberations, the Multilink special committee considered a variety of factors that the special committee believes make the
merger attractive to the Multilink shareholders and could contribute to the success of the combined company, including the following: 



The merger will offer the stockholders of the combined company the potential benefits described above under the heading Vitesses Reasons for the Merger;



The merger will result in a combined company with greater financial, technological and human resources to develop or acquire new products and new technologies, and greater sales and
marketing resources to help promote and sell Multilinks products; 



The merger will allow the combined company to provide a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers than either company could provide alone;



The combination of the operations of the two companies should also result in efficiencies arising from shared business functions, information and other systems, and proprietary
technologies; 



The broad experience of the Vitesse management team and the significant marketing resources of Vitesse will contribute to stronger product planning and operational execution;



Multilink will have access to the customer base of Vitesse and may benefit from increased distribution of Multilinks products; 



Multilink and Vitesse share a number of important long-term corporate values, including a commitment to market leadership through innovative products and a desire to continuously
deliver more value to customers; 



Both companies also benefit from talented and dedicated employees with a long-standing commitment to excellence; 





The risks and potential rewards associated with continuing to execute the strategic plan of Multilink as an independent entity, including the risk that in the current economic
environment, Multilink might not be able to raise additional capital as necessary to continue its business, concluding that the likelihood of increasing shareholder value was greater pursuant to the merger than the likelihood of doing so on a
stand-alone basis; 



The possibility of seeking to engage in a business combination or other strategic transaction with a company other than Vitesse, concluding that a transaction with Vitesse was more
feasible and expected to yield greater benefits to shareholders than other alternatives; 



The exchange ratio of the shares of Vitesse common stock that the Multilink shareholders will receive in the merger represents a substantial premium to the market price as of the
fifteen day trading period prior to the date of the merger agreement for the Multilink shareholders, with an opportunity for further appreciation in the market price of the Vitesse common stock; 



The current and historical information concerning the trading prices and volatility of the two companies shares; 



The analyses and presentations prepared by Chanin, and the opinion of Chanin to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, the merger consideration was fair from a financial
point of view to the shareholders of Multilink, as more fully described below under Opinion of Multilinks Financial Advisor; 



The expected qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and 



The historical information concerning the business, financial performance and condition, market opportunity and position, technology and management of the two companies.

In addition, the Multilink special committee
considered a number of potentially negative factors relating to the merger, including the following: 



the risk that Vitesses stock price will fall, thereby diminishing the value of the consideration being paid to the Multilink shareholders; 



the risk that expected benefits of the merger may not be realized; 



the risk of disruption of sales as a result of uncertainties created by the announcement of the merger; 



the risk of loss of key talent; 



the risk that the merger might not be consummated despite the parties efforts, even if approved by Multilinks shareholders; 



the risk that Multilink may find it more difficult to attract and hire skilled employees as part of a much larger enterprise; and 



the other risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under Risk Factors. 

After considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of the merger, the Multilink special committee unanimously
determined that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the potentially negative effects of the merger. 

After careful consideration, the Multilink special committee has unanimously determined that, in light of all the factors that it considered, it believes
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby to be fair to, and in the best interests of, Multilink and the Multilink shareholders. 
Accordingly, the special committee has unanimously recommended that the Multilink board of
directors approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.



Recommendation of the Multilink board of directors 

After careful consideration, the Multilink board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are fair to, and in the best interests of
Multilink and its shareholders based on the analyses and conclusions of the Special Committee (which the Multilink board of directors adopted as its own). 

The Multilink board of directors unanimously recommends that the Multilink shareholders vote FOR approval of the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. 

This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Multilink special committee and board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive. Given the complexity of the issues and the number of factors considered, neither the
Multilink special committee nor the Multilink board attempted to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weight to specific factors. The Multilink special committee and board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the factors described
above, and considered the factors, taken as a whole, to be favorable to and to support their determination. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the Multilink board of directors may have given different weight to
different factors. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Multilink 

The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Multilink Technology Corporation retained Chanin Capital L.L.C., or Chanin, to provide the Special Committee with advice and assistance in analyzing and evaluating
the financial terms of the contemplated business combination with Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, including providing an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration (as defined in Chanins opinion)
to be received by the shareholders of Multilink. 

On June 9,
2003, Chanin delivered a written opinion to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Multilink, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Multilinks
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, individually and as a whole (other than Vitesse or its subsidiaries). Chanin presented the financial analysis underlying its opinion at a meeting of the Special Committee on June 3, 2003, and again at a
meeting of the Board of Directors on June 4, 2003. 

The full
text of the Chanin opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the Chanin opinion set
forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Chanin opinion. MULTILINK SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY. 

THE CHANIN OPINION IS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY MULTILINK SHAREHOLDERS FROM A
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW AS OF THE DATE OF THE OPINION. THE OPINION WAS PROVIDED FOR THE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE OF MULTILINKS SPECIAL COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER CONTEMPLATED BY THE
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER. THE CHANIN OPINION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW SUCH SHAREHOLDER SHOULD VOTE ON THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER. 

In conducting its analysis and arriving at its opinion, Chanin reviewed
information and considered financial data and other factors as Chanin deemed relevant under the circumstances, including the following: 



a draft, dated June 6, 2003 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (including the disclosure letters to the Agreement and Plan of Merger); 



certain publicly-available historical financial and operating data for Multilink, including, but not limited to, (a) Multilinks Form 10-K for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002; (b) 



Multilinks Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003; (c) Multilinks Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 28,
2003; and (d) Multilinks unaudited internal financial statements for the month ended April 30, 2003; 



certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Multilink including, among others, a liquidation analysis and financial forecasts, prepared
by management of Multilink; 



historical stock market prices and trading volumes for Multilinks Class A common stock; 



certain publicly-available historical financial and operating data for Vitesse including, but not limited to, (a) Vitesses Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended September 30,
2000, 2001 and 2002; (b) Vitesses Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003; (c) Vitesses Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2002; and (d) Vitesses Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on
January 28, 2003; 



certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data, including, among others, financial forecasts concerning Vitesse, prepared by management of Vitesse;



historical stock market prices and trading volumes for Vitesse common stock; 



publicly available financial, operating and stock market data concerning certain companies engaged in businesses Chanin deemed reasonably similar to that of Multilink;



the financial terms of certain recent transactions Chanin deemed relevant to its inquiry; and 



such other financial studies, analyses and investigations that Chanin deemed appropriate. 

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Chanin assumed, with Multilinks consent, that the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
when executed, conformed to the drafts of such agreement that Chanin reviewed in all respects material to its analysis. Chanin further assumed that the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger will be consummated on the terms
described in such agreement without modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement therein. 

Chanin discussed with the senior management of Multilink and Vitesse (i) the past and current operating and financial condition of their respective
businesses, (ii) the prospects, including estimates of future financial performance, of their respective businesses, and (iii) such other matters that Chanin deemed relevant. 

In connection with Chanins review and in arriving at its opinion, Chanin relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information that was publicly available or was provided by Multilink or Vitesse. Chanin did not undertake any independent verification of such information or any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Multilink or Vitesse, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Multilink or Vitesse. With respect to the financial forecasts provided to Chanin by Multilink and Vitesse, Chanin
assumed that such information (and the assumptions and bases underlying such information) was reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting managements best then available estimate and judgment as to the future financial performance of Multilink
and Vitesse, respectively. Chanin expressed no view with respect to such forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. 

The Chanin opinion was necessarily based on economic, financial and market conditions as they existed and were disclosed to Chanin as of the date of its
opinion. The Chanin opinion speaks only as of the date thereof, and Chanin has no responsibility to update or revise its opinion based upon events or circumstances occurring after that date. 

In arriving at its opinion, Chanin was not requested or authorized to
solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition of Multilink or any of its assets, and Chanin did not participate in the negotiation of the exchange ratio or any other terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger.
The Chanin opinion does not address, nor should it be construed to address, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other transactions or alternative business strategies that may be available to Multilink. 



In arriving at its opinion, Chanin performed a variety of valuation, financial, and comparative analyses.
The summary of the analyses as set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses Chanin performed. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate
and relevant methods of financial analysis to be employed and the manner in which such methods will be applied to a particular set of facts and circumstances. As such, the preparation of a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Chanin believes that the analyses it performed must be considered as a whole, and selecting portions thereof or portions of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Chanin made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Multilink. Additionally, estimates of the values of businesses and securities examined do not purport to be appraisals thereof and do not necessarily reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities may be sold. Accordingly,
these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. 

In addition, the Chanin opinion did not in any manner address the prices at which Vitesse common stock may trade following consummation of the Merger. Chanin expressed no opinion or view with respect to the Voting
Agreements entered into by certain shareholders of Multilink. 

The Chanin opinion, including Chanins presentation of its opinion to the Multilink Special Committee and Board of Directors, was one of many factors that the Special Committee and the Board of Directors took into consideration in
making their determination to recommend approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Consequently, Chanins analysis described below should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of
Multilink with respect to the Merger Consideration. 

Subject to
the foregoing, the following is a brief summary of the material financial and comparative analyses presented by Chanin to the Multilink Special Committee and Board of Directors, in connection with the delivery of its opinion. You should understand
that the order of the analyses and the results derived from these analyses described below do no represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Chanin. 

Contribution Analysis
.
    Chanin utilized historical financial results and the
financial projections of management of Multilink and the historical financial results and the financial projections of management of Vitesse in order to compare the pro forma ownership of the combined company following the Merger to the pro forma
contributions by each of Multilink and Vitesse based upon historical and projected revenues and gross profit. Multilinks calendar year 2002 gross profit was calculated excluding $1.1 million, $5.7 million and $1.6 million of asset impairment,
inventory write-down charges and deferred stock compensation, respectively. 

The following table indicates the relative contribution of both Multilink and Vitesse to the combined company:

Chanin noted that the percentage contributions of annualized revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2003
and estimated calendar year 2003 revenue of Multilink were similar to Multilinks post transaction pro forma ownership percentages of the combined company. Chanin also noted that Multilinks post transaction ownership percentages compared
favorably to Multilinks last quarter annualized gross profit and estimated calendar year 2003 gross profit contributions. 

Exchange Ratio Premium Analysis
.
    Chanin analyzed the stock price premiums paid in four precedent semiconductor
M&A transactions announced over the past two years, where the stock consideration represented more than 50% of the total consideration and the value of the transaction was less than $300 million. The transactions analyzed were: 



the pending acquisition of Oak Technology, Inc. by Zoran Corporation; 



the acquisition of Clare, Inc. by IXYS Corporation; 



the acquisition of Sage, Inc. by Genesis Microchip, Inc.; and 



the acquisition of Luminent, Inc. by MRV Communications, Inc. 

The average premiums in these transactions over the ratios of the targets closing stock prices to the acquirors closing stock prices prior to
the announcement of the transaction were then applied to the historic average ratios of the closing prices between Multilink Class A common stock and Vitesse common stock as of June 2, 2003, to arrive at an implied exchange ratio for the Merger.

Chanin observed that
the corresponding average exchange ratio premiums implied by the terms of the Merger of 32.9%, 24.0%, 20.0% and 16.0% for the one, five, fifteen and thirty trading days prior to June 2, 2003, respectively, were higher in all cases than the median
percentage premium paid in the precedent semiconductor M&A transactions analyzed by Chanin. Using the range of premiums in the selected precedent transaction, Chanin derived a range of implied exchange ratios for the Merger of 0.3782 to 0.6743.
Chanin noted that the exchange ratio in the Merger of 0.5493 was higher in all cases than the exchange ratios implied by the median percentage premiums for the one, five, fifteen and thirty trading days prior to the announcements of the transactions
analyzed. 

Liquidation
Analysis
.    Chanin analyzed the estimated per share liquidation value available to holders of the Multilink common stock if Multilink were to commence a liquidation on June 30, 2003, and compared the liquidation value
per share to the implied value of Vitesse common stock that each share of Multilink common stock will receive in the Merger, on both a book value basis and a basis reflecting certain estimates of Multilinks management.

Chanin noted that the $2.78 value per

certain liabilities based on its best available estimates ($1.40).

In addition, Chanin reviewed the stock trading history of Multilinks Class A common stock and Vitesses common stock for the following periods
ended June 2, 2003: (i) since Multilinks initial public offering, (ii) the latest twelve months (LTM), (iii) 2003 year to date, and (iv) the latest three months. The following table shows the percent change over the previously

Publicly Traded Company
Analysis
.
    Chanin reviewed the current trading multiples of seven publicly-traded companies that Chanin determined to be comparable to Multilink. However, as further explained below, Chanin did not consider it
appropriate to utilize financial measures of these public companies to determine a range of implied values for Multilink or to compare the trading multiples of Multilink with those of these public companies given Multilinks significant
negative enterprise value and current and projected operating performance. Chanin computed the LTM revenues, projected 2003 revenues, LTM earnings per share, projected 2003 and 2004 earnings per share and the most currently available book value of
these publicly traded companies. Chanin then analyzed the peer groups trading multiples of enterprise value to their respective LTM revenues and projected 2003 revenues, their multiples of equity value per share to their respective LTM
earnings 



per share and projected 2003 and 2004 earnings per share, and their multiples of equity value to their respective book values. The companies analyzed were:



Applied Micro Circuits Corporation 



Conexant Systems, Inc. 



Exar Corporation 



Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. 



PMC-Sierra, Inc. 



Silicon Laboratories, Inc. 



Transwitch Corporation 

Chanin noted that Multilink has a negative enterprise value and does not have positive LTM earnings per share or positive projected 2003 or 2004 earnings
per share. Given these facts and the severe and rapid decline in Multilinks financial results and prospects, Chanin did not deem it appropriate to apply the multiples of the publicly-traded peer group to the operating financial data of
Multilink to arrive at a range of implied values for Multilink, or to compare the trading multiples of Multilink with those of publicly-traded companies. 

Selected Precedent M&A Transactions Analysis.
    Chanin reviewed ten selected merger and acquisition transactions
involving target companies that Chanin determined to be comparable to Multilink. However, as further explained below, Chanin did not consider it appropriate to utilize financial measures of precedent transactions to determine a range of implied
values for Multilink common stock or to compare the multiple paid in the Merger with those of the precedent merger and acquisition transactions given Multilinks significant negative enterprise value and current and projected operating
performance. Chanin computed the LTM revenues, projected revenues, LTM earnings per share, projected net income and the most currently available book value of the target companies Chanin then analyzed the aggregate purchase price of each transaction
to the targets respective LTM revenues and projected revenues, the equity purchase price of the transaction to the respective targets LTM and projected net income, and the equity value of the transaction to the respective targets
book value. The transactions analyzed were: 



the pending acquisition of Oak Technology, Inc. by Zoran Corporation; 



the acquisition of Agere Systems optoelectronics business by TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc.; 



the acquisition of Agere Systems wireless LAN equipment business by Proxim Corporation; 



the acquisition of Clare, Inc. by IXYS Corporation; 



the acquisition of Alcatels microelectronics division by ST Microelectronics NV; 



the acquisition of Transilica, Inc. by Microtune, Inc.; 



the acquisition of Viranta Corporation by Globespan, Inc.; 



the acquisition of Sage, Inc. by Genesis Microchip, Inc.; 



the acquisition of Luminent, Inc. by MRV Communications, Inc.; and 



the acquisition of ServerWorks Corporation by Broadcom Corporation. 

However, given Multilinks negative enterprise value and lack of positive LTM earnings per share or positive projected 2003 or 2004 earnings per
share, and given the severe and rapid decline in Multilinks financial results and prospects, Chanin did not deem it appropriate to apply multiples of the precedent merger and acquisition transactions to the operating financial data of
Multilink to arrive at a range of implied values for Multilink common stock, nor to compare the multiple paid in the Merger with those of the precedent merger and acquisition transactions. 



The comparable companies and the acquired entities in the precedent transactions identified above were
selected for comparative purposes only. None of these entities is identical to Multilink, and none of the comparable transactions reviewed is identical to the proposed transaction. Accordingly, an analysis of selected comparable companies and
transactions is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of
the comparable company or companies to which they are being compared. 

The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Multilink selected Chanin to serve as the its financial advisor and to provide its opinion because Chanin is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with experience and expertise in
transactions similar to the Merger and regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with merger and acquisition transactions. Pursuant to an engagement letter, Chanin has received customary fees for providing its
opinion. In addition, the engagement letter with Chanin provides that Multilink will reimburse Chanin for its out-of-pocket and incidental expenses and will indemnify Chanin and related persons against some liabilities, including liabilities under
securities laws, arising out of the proposed transaction or its engagement by Multilink. 

Agreement with investment bank 

Depending on the total value of the consideration to be received by Multilinks shareholders in the merger, Multilink may be obligated to pay a transaction fee to an investment bank. Prior to Multilinks engagement of Chanin,
Multilink entered into an engagement letter in August 2002 with an investment bank. This engagement letter was terminated by Multilink in November 2002; however, Multilink was subject to a potential obligation to pay a transaction fee to the
investment bank if Multilink completed a strategic transaction within twelve months of the termination of the engagement letter. This fee was contingent upon the total amount of consideration received by Multilink and its shareholders in such a
transaction. Pursuant to a May 2003 letter agreement between Multilink and the investment bank, the investment bank agreed to waive any such fee in connection with the proposed merger between Multilink and Vitesse, on the condition that the total
consideration to be paid by Vitesse in connection with the merger is less than $30 million, subject to Multilinks reimbursement of the investment banks incurred expenses of approximately $80,000. In the event that the aggregate value of
the consideration paid by Vitesse in the merger exceeds $30 million, Multilink could be required to pay an additional transaction fee to the investment bank. 

Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of Multilink in the Merger 

In considering the recommendation of the Multilink board of directors that Multilink shareholders vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement,
Multilink shareholders should be aware that some Multilink executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, their interests as shareholders of Multilink. 

These interests relate to or arise from, among other things: 



the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of Multilink under the merger agreement and Vitesses providing these individuals with directors and
officers insurance; 



the potential receipt of bonus and retention payments; 



the conversion of stock options; and 



the potential acceleration of vesting with regard to those options if the executive officers are terminated after the merger. 



Vitesse has also entered into voting agreements with certain officers, directors and shareholders of
Multilink which are discussed under Agreements Related to the Merger-Voting Agreements. The Multilink board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation. 

Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance 

Under the merger agreement, Vitesse has agreed to cause the surviving corporation, for six years after the merger, to indemnify all directors and officers of Multilink to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
provided under Multilinks articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, and under the indemnification agreements between such persons and Multilink in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, for
all acts or omissions prior to the merger by such individuals in such capacities. Vitesse has also agreed to cause the surviving corporation to provide, for six years after the merger, directors and officers liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger covering each person currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy of Multilink on terms and in amounts no less favorable than those of the policies
of Multilink, provided that Vitesse will not be required to pay aggregate premiums for the insurance in excess of $400,000 (in addition to up to $600,000 that Multilink is permitted to pay prior to closing of the merger for such insurance). Vitesse
has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain charter and bylaw provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those contained in the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Multilink as in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed. 

Payments to Executive Officers and Employees 

The Multilink board of directors has approved the payment of a cash bonus of $300,000 to Dr. Nottenburg contingent upon the completion of the proposed merger with Vitesse. In considering the award, the board of
directors also considered the work undertaken by Dr. Nottenburg to initiate the merger process in an extremely challenging operating environment and the continued efforts which would be required by Dr. Nottenburg in order to complete the merger. The
board of directors also considered Dr. Nottenburgs contributions to Multilink during the past year, as well as Dr. Nottenburgs waiver during 2002 of any bonus compensation. 

The Multilink board of directors also approved retention arrangements with three of Multilinks key financial
employees, John Soenksen, Multilinks Chief Financial Officer, Frank Probst, Multilinks Controller, and Richard Sawchak, Multilinks Director, Investor Relations, whereby each of these individuals would receive retention payments
equal to three months of their respective base salaries in addition to Multilinks standard severance payment upon the earlier of (i) their termination, other than for cause, in connection with the proposed merger, or (ii) the successful
completion of the proposed merger. In considering the award, the board of directors had considered not only the contributions to Multilink made by each of these individuals, but also the continued efforts that would be required by each of these
individuals to complete the merger. 

Prior to the signing of
the merger agreement, the Multilink board of directors also approved amendments to the option agreements of Dr. Nottenburg to provide that (i) the options subject thereto will not accelerate and terminate upon a change in control of Multilink,
including the proposed merger, if and to the extent such options are, in connection with the change in control, to be assumed by the acquiring corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of
the change in control transaction and (ii) if Dr. Nottenburg should cease to be employed by Multilink for any reason while his options are outstanding, then Dr. Nottenburg shall have a period of twelve (12) months following his termination of
employment during which to exercise his options. 

Stock Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock 

Vitesse has agreed to assume, upon the completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Multilink Class A common stock which is outstanding immediately prior to the merger, whether or not



exercisable or vested and each outstanding warrant, whether or not exercisable or vested. Vitesse has agreed to assume each Multilink stock option and
warrant on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the plan and the stock option agreement or warrant agreement pursuant to which the option or warrant was issued and evidenced, subject to the modifications noted above. Each share of
Multilink Class A common stock which is unvested and has been issued pursuant to any Multilink stock option plan shall, upon the closing of the merger, be converted into the right to receive the number of unvested shares of Vitesse common stock
determined pursuant to the same exchange ratio applicable to all outstanding shares of Multilink common stock. Such unvested Vitesse shares shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the unvested shares of Multilink
Class A common stock under each corresponding Multilink stock option plan and the terms of the stock issuance agreements governing such unvested Multilink shares. 



Number of shares of Vitesse common stock subject to option and warrant:
    Each option and warrant shall be exercisable for the same number of shares of
Vitesse common stock as the holder of the option or warrant, as applicable, would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the merger had such holder exercised the option or warrant to purchase Multilink Class A common stock in full immediately
prior to the merger, provided that any fractional share of Vitesse common stock resulting from an aggregation of all the shares of a holder subject to such options or warrants shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.



Exercise price of option and warrant:    
The exercise price per share of Vitesse common stock of each assumed option and warrant shall equal, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent, (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Multilink Class A common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such option or warrant divided by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Vitesse common stock deemed
purchasable pursuant to such option or warrant. 



Vesting of options and restricted stock upon termination of employment:

Options outstanding under Multilinks 1999 Stock Option Plan which are held by persons employed by Multilink as of the
merger and assumed by Vitesse in the merger will automatically accelerate and become fully exercisable for vested shares of Vitesse common stock on the earlier of: (i) 6 months following the date of the merger, or (ii) the date, if any, on which the
optionees employment is terminated without cause after or as a result of the merger. Options outstanding under Multilinks 2000 Stock Incentive Plan which are held by persons employed by Multilink as of the merger and assumed by Vitesse
in the merger will automatically accelerate and become fully exercisable for vested shares of Vitesse common stock upon an involuntary termination of the optionees employment within 18 months following the merger. Options accelerated under the
2000 Stock Incentive Plan will remain exercisable until the earlier of: (i) the original expiration date of the option or (ii) 1 year from the date of the optionees involuntary termination. 

Unvested shares of Vitesse common stock received in the merger in exchange
for unvested shares of Multilink Class A common stock outstanding under Multilinks 2000 Stock Incentive Plan will automatically accelerate and become fully vested shares of Vitesse common stock upon an involuntary termination of the
holders employment within 12 months following the merger. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Vitesse has agreed that unvested shares of Multilink Class A common stock held by employees of Multilink who are terminated without cause after the
date of the merger agreement and prior to the closing of the merger will become fully vested shares of Multilink Class A common stock immediately upon the employees termination. 

In addition, for any Multilink stock option intended to be an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Options held by officers and directors of Multilink as of the merger will be treated in the same manner as other options, other than the options of Dr. Nottenburg discussed above. 



As of July 15, 2003, options to purchase 1,122,520 shares of Multilink Class A common stock were
outstanding under Multilinks 1998 Stock Option Plan, options to purchase 247,600 shares of Multilink Class A common stock were outstanding under Multilinks 1999 Stock Option Plan, and options to purchase 2,068,123 shares of
Multilink Class A common stock were outstanding under Multilinks 2000 Stock Incentive Plan. Of these amounts, options to purchase 1,187,975 shares of Multilink Class A common stock were held by Multilinks officers and directors. As of
July 15, 2003, warrants to purchase 352,508 shares of Multilink Class A common stock were outstanding, of which warrants to purchase 243,920 were held by Multilinks officers and directors and their affiliates. 

Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates 

The shares of Vitesse common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act. These shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Vitesse common stock
issued to any person who is an affiliate of Multilink or Vitesse. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control of Multilink and may include some of their
respective officers and directors, as well as their respective principal stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of Vitesse common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to (1) an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, (2) an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (3) any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

Completion and effectiveness of the merger 

The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by the shareholders of Multilink. The
merger will become effective upon the filing of the articles of merger with the State of California. 

Structure of the merger and conversion of Multilink common stock 

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Margaux Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse, will merge with and into Multilink. Multilink
will then be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse. 

Upon
completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Multilink Class A and Class B common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.5493 shares of Vitesse common stock. No fractional shares of Vitesse common stock will be issued pursuant to
the merger. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of Vitesse common stock, Multilink shareholders will receive cash equal to the product of such fractional share amount, after aggregating all fractional shares to which a former holder of
Multilink common stock would be entitled, and the average closing price of Vitesse common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for the five trading days immediately preceding the effectiveness of the merger. Options to purchase shares of
Multilink common stock will be converted into options to purchase shares of Vitesse common stock after completion of the merger. The number of shares covered by, and the exercise price for, each option will be adjusted using the merger exchange
ratio of 0.5493 shares of Vitesse for each share of Multilink. 

Material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger 

The following summary discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to Multilink shareholders. This discussion does
not address all of the United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular shareholders in light of their particular circumstances or to shareholders who are subject to special rules, such as: 



dealers in securities or foreign currencies 



shareholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; 





tax-exempt organizations; 



non-United States persons or entities; 



financial institutions or insurance companies; 



shareholders whose shares are qualified small business stock under Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code; 



shareholders who acquired Multilink common stock in connection with stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or 



shareholders who hold Multilink common stock as part of an integrated investment, straddle, hedge, or constructive sale, comprised of shares of Multilink common stock and one or
more other positions. 

In addition, this
discussion does not include the tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax law or the consequences of other transactions that may take place before, after, or concurrently with the merger. This discussion assumes that Multilink
shareholders hold their shares of Multilink common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, as property held as an investment). 

The United States federal income tax consequences of the merger depend on whether it will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The completion of the merger is conditioned upon the delivery at closing of an opinion by Allen Matkins that the merger will qualify as a reorganization
and that Vitesse, Multilink and Margaux Acquisition Corporation will be parties to that reorganization. The opinion is not binding upon the courts or the Internal Revenue Service and will not prevent the Internal Revenue Service from successfully
asserting a contrary position. Moreover, the opinion of Allen Matkins will be based on assumptions, representations and covenants, including those in the merger agreement and in representation letters from the managements of Vitesse and Multilink
dated as of the date of this proxy statement and as of the closing date, and on the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, case law, and other authorities, all as presently in effect. Allen Matkins ability to provide the closing tax
opinion will depend on the absence of changes in existing facts or in law between the date of this proxy statement and closing date of the merger. If any of those assumptions, representations or covenants is inaccurate, Allen Matkins may not be able
to provide the required closing date opinion or the tax consequences of the merger could differ form those described in the opinion that Allen Matkins has delivered. Multilink will not request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the
tax consequences of the merger to Multilink shareholders. 

ACCORDINGLY, MULTILINK SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR PERSONAL TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS TO THEIR
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

If the merger were not treated as a
reorganization, it would be a fully taxable transaction for all Multilink shareholders, and each Multilink shareholder would recognize aggregate capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value
of the Vitesse common stock and any cash received pursuant to the merger and (ii) the Multilink shareholders tax basis in its shares of Multilink common stock. In that event, the aggregate tax basis of the Vitesse common stock received by a
Multilink shareholder in connection with the merger would be equal to the fair market value of such Vitesse common stock, and the holding period of that stock would begin the day after the merger. 

The discussion that follows represents the opinion of Allen Matkins as to the
material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger if the merger is treated as a reorganization and Vitesse, Multilink and Margaux are parties to that reorganization, as provided in the opinion to be delivered by Allen Matkins at
the closing of the merger. 



Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization, as provided in the tax opinion described above, then
the following material United States federal income tax consequences will result from such qualification: 



None of Vitesse, Margaux or Multilink will recognize any gain or loss solely as a result of the merger; 



Multilink shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of their shares for shares of Vitesse common stock pursuant to the merger, except with respect to cash
received instead of a fractional share of Vitesse common stock as discussed below; 



The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Vitesse common stock received by Multilink shareholders in exchange for shares of Multilink common stock pursuant to the merger will be the
same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Multilink common stock surrendered in the merger, reduced by any tax basis allocable to a fractional share of Multilink common stock for which cash is received; 



Cash payments received by a Multilink shareholder for a fractional share of Vitesse common stock will be treated as if such fractional share had been issued in connection with the
merger and then redeemed by Vitesse, and a Multilink shareholder will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to such cash payment, measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the shareholders tax basis in
such fractional share. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss to a Multilink shareholder if, as of the date of the merger, the holding period for the fractional share redeemed (which will include the holding period of the
Multilink shares surrendered in the merger) is more than one year; 



The holding period of the shares of Vitesse common stock received in exchange for shares of Multilink common stock will include the holding period of the Multilink common stock
exchanged therefor; and 



Multilink shareholders who receive cash for their Multilink common stock as a result of exercising statutory appraisal rights will be treated as having received a distribution in
redemption of their stock, subject to Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code. Assuming that the requirements of Section 302 are satisfied, such shareholders will have a taxable capital gain (or capital loss), measured by the difference between the
cash payment received and their tax basis in the shares as to which the appraisal rights are exercised, assuming that those shares are held as capital assets when the appraisal rights are elected. In general, such shareholders should also be able to
reduce that capital gain (or increase that capital loss) by the amount of any expenses they incur in pursuing or prosecuting their appraisal rights. Dissenting shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of Section
302. 

The preceding is not meant to be a complete discussion or
analysis of all potential tax effects relevant to the merger. Thus, Multilink shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, federal,
state, local and other applicable tax laws, and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

Accounting treatment of the merger 

The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under generally accepted accounting principles. The purchase price will be allocated to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
acquired from Multilink. A portion of the purchase price may be identified as in-process research and development. This amount, if any, will be charged to Vitesses operations in the quarter the merger is completed and the acquisition
accounting and valuation amounts are finalized. The excess purchase price will be recorded as goodwill. 

Any identified intangible assets with definite lives will be amortized to earnings over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Identified intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill will not be amortized to earnings, but instead will be tested for
impairment at least annually. 



The results of operations and cash flows of Multilink will be included in Vitesses financial
statements prospectively as of the consummation of the merger.

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger 

Vitesse and Multilink conduct operations in a number of other jurisdictions where regulatory filings, notifications or approvals with applicable
commissions and other authorities may be required or advisable in connection with completion of the merger. Vitesse and Multilink are currently reviewing whether filings or approvals may be required or desirable in these other jurisdictions. We
recognize that some of these filings may not be completed before the closing, and that some of these approvals, which are not required to be obtained prior to effectiveness of a merger, may also not be obtained before the closing of the merger.

It is possible that governmental entities having jurisdiction
over Vitesse and Multilink may seek regulatory concessions as conditions for granting approval of the merger. A regulatory bodys approval may contain terms or impose conditions or restrictions relating or applying to, or requiring changes in
or limitations on, the operation or ownership of any asset or business of Vitesse, Multilink or any of their subsidiaries, or Vitesses ownership of Multilink, or requiring asset divestitures, which conditional approval could reasonably be
expected to result in a substantial detriment to Vitesse, Multilink and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after the closing. If such an approval requires these kinds of restrictions, conditions, changes, limitations or divestitures, either
Vitesse or Multilink can decline to close under the merger agreement. 

California dissenters rights 

The following is a summary of Sections 1300 through 1313 of the General Corporation Law of California, which sets forth the procedures for Multilink shareholders to dissent from the merger and to demand statutory appraisal rights under the
General Corporation Law of California. This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the provisions of California law relating to the rights of Multilink shareholders to an appraisal of the value of their shares and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Sections 1300 to and including 1313 of the General Corporation Law of California, the full text of which is attached as Annex D. Failure to follow the following procedures exactly could result in the loss of dissenters
rights. 

Under Sections 181 and 1201 of the General Corporation
Law of California, the merger constitutes a reorganization. Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California provides appraisal rights for shareholders dissenting from reorganizations in certain circumstances. Multilink Class A
common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market. Multilink Class B common stock is not publicly traded. Multilink Class B shareholders will be entitled to dissent and seek appraisal for their shares of Class B common stock. Multilink Class A
shareholders will be entitled to dissent and seek appraisal for their shares of Multilink Class A common stock only if either of the following criteria are satisfied: 



the Class A common shares for which appraisal rights are sought must possess restrictions on transfer (for example, the shares must be restricted securities not
registered pursuant to the Securities Act and must not be eligible for unrestricted resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act); 

OR 



5% or more of the outstanding shares of Multilink Class A common stock (i.e., approximately 255,000 shares of Multilink Class A common stock) must dissent from the proposed merger
and demand appraisal. 

Even though a shareholder
who wishes to exercise dissenters rights may be required to take certain actions before the Multilink special meeting, if the merger agreement is later terminated and the merger is abandoned, no Multilink shareholder will have the right to any
payment from Multilink by reason of having taken that action. The following discussion is subject to those qualifications. 



For a Multilink Class A shareholder to exercise dissenters rights as to any shares of Multilink
Class A common stock in connection with the merger, the shareholder must vote against the merger and merger agreement and make a written demand to have Multilink purchase the shares at their fair market price. For a Multilink Class B shareholder to
exercise dissenters rights as to any shares of Multilink Class B common stock in connection with the merger, the shareholder must not vote in favor of the merger and merger agreement and make a written demand to have Multilink purchase the
shares at their fair market price. 

The written demand must:

1.    be made by the record holder of the
shares; thus, a beneficial owner of Multilink stock registered in the record ownership of another person (such as a broker or nominee) should instruct the record holder to follow the procedures for perfecting dissenters rights if the
beneficial owner wants to dissent with respect to any or all of those shares; 

2.    be mailed or otherwise directed to Multilink Technology Corporation, 300 Atrium Drive, Somerset, NJ 08873, Attention: Corporate Secretary; 

3.    in the case of Multilink Class A common stock, the
demand must be received not later than the date of the special meeting; 

4.    in the case of Multilink Class B common stock, the demand must be received within 30 days of the date of mailing of the notice of approval of the merger (described below); 

5.    specify the shareholders name and mailing
address and the number of Multilink shares held of record; 

6.    state that the shareholder is demanding purchase of the shares and payment of their fair market value; and 

7.    state the price which the shareholder claims to be the relevant (see below) fair market value of the shares (this statement will
constitute an offer by the shareholder to sell the shares to Multilink at that price). 

In addition, within 30 days after notice of the approval of the merger is mailed to shareholders, the shareholder must also submit to Multilink, for endorsement as dissenting shares, the stock certificates
representing the Multilink shares as to which the shareholder is exercising dissenters rights. 

Simply failing to vote for, or voting against, the proposed merger will not be sufficient to constitute the demand described above. 

Multilink shares held by shareholders who have perfected their
dissenters rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California and have not withdrawn their demands or otherwise lost their rights are referred to in this summary as dissenting shares. 

Within ten days after approval of the merger by Multilink shareholders,
Multilink must mail a notice of the approval to each appropriately dissenting Class A shareholder, and each Class B shareholder who has not voted in favor of the merger. This notice must state the price determined by Multilink to represent the
relevant fair market value of the dissenting shares. Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California states that the fair market value, for this purpose, is determined as of the day before the first announcement of the terms of
the proposed merger. The statute does not explain whether, in the case of shares such as Multilink Class A common stock that are publicly traded, day means trading day or calendar day. The terms of the merger were first announced when
the merger agreement was signed, which was shortly after the close of the trading day for Multilink Class A common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on June 9, 2003. Multilink believes (and in any litigation would assert) that, given the clear
rationale for the statutory rule, the better interpretation of the statute should be that the fair market value of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock for purposes of Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California should be
determined as of June 9, 2003. 



Multilinks notice must also include a brief description of the procedures to be followed by those
holders in order to pursue their dissenters rights and a copy of Sections 1300 through 1304 of Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California. A statement of price by Multilink will constitute an offer by Multilink to purchase the
dissenting shares at the stated amount if the merger closes. 

Irrespective of the percentage of Multilink shares with respect to which demands for appraisal have been properly filed, Multilink must mail the notice referred to above to any shareholder who has filed a demand with respect to Multilink
shares that are subject to transfer restrictions imposed by Multilink. Multilink is not aware of any transfer restrictions on its shares, except for those restrictions which apply to some of the Class A common shares held by shareholders who are
deemed to be affiliates of Multilink as that term is defined in Rule 144 adopted by the SEC under the Securities Act. Any shareholders who believe there is another type of restriction on their shares should consult with their own advisor as to the
nature of the restriction and its relationship to the availability of dissenters rights in connection with the merger. 

If Multilink and a dissenting shareholder agree that the shares are dissenting shares and agree on the purchase price of the shares, the dissenting
shareholder is entitled to receive the agreed-upon price with interest at the legal rate on judgments from the date of that agreement. Payment for the dissenting shares must be made within 30 days after the later of the date of that agreement or the
date on which all statutory and contractual conditions to the merger are satisfied. Payments are also conditioned on the surrender to Multilink of the certificates representing the dissenting shares. 

If Multilink denies that shares are dissenting shares or the shareholder
fails to agree with Multilink as to the fair market value of the shares, then, within the time period provided by Section 1304(a) of Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California, any shareholder who has made a valid written demand and has
not voted in favor of approval of the merger may file a complaint in the superior court in the proper California county requesting a determination as to whether the shares are dissenting shares or as to the fair market value of the holders
shares, or both, or may intervene in any pending action brought by any other Multilink shareholder. 

On the trial of the action, the court determines the issues. If the status of the shares as dissenting shares is in issue, the court first resolves that
issue. If the fair market value of the dissenting shares is in issue, the court determines, or appoints one or more impartial appraisers to determine, the fair market value of the shares. 

If the court appoints an appraiser or appraisers, they proceed to determine the fair market value per share. Within the time
fixed by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of the appraisers, make and file a report in the office of the clerk of the court. Thereafter, on the motion of any party, the report is submitted to the court and considered on such evidence as the
court considers relevant. If the court finds the report reasonable, the court may confirm it. 

If the single appraiser or a majority of the appraisers fails to make and file a report within 10 days after the date of their appointment or within such further time as the court allows, or if the court does not
confirm the report, the court determines the fair market value of the dissenting shares. Subject to Section 1306 of Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of California, judgment is rendered against the corporation for payment of an amount equal
to the fair market value of each dissenting share multiplied by the number of dissenting shares that any dissenting shareholder who is a party, or who has intervened, is entitled to require the corporation to purchase, with interest at the legal
rate from the date on which the judgment is entered. 

The costs
of the action, including reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, is assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable. However, if the price determined by the court is more than 125 percent of the price offered by
the corporation, the corporation pays the costs (including, in the discretion of the court, attorneys fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest at the legal rate on judgments from the date the shareholder made the demand and submitted shares
for endorsement). 



Except as expressly limited by Chapter 13, holders of dissenting shares continue to have all the rights
and privileges incident to their shares until the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined. 

A holder of dissenting shares may not withdraw a demand for payment unless Multilink consents to the withdrawal. Dissenting shares lose their status as
dissenting shares, and dissenting shareholders cease to be entitled to require Multilink to purchase their shares, if: 



the merger is abandoned; 



the shares are transferred before their submission to Multilink for the required endorsement; 



the dissenting shareholder and Multilink do not agree on the status of the shares as dissenting shares or do not agree on the purchase price, but neither Multilink nor the
shareholder files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action within six months after Multilink mails a notice that its shareholders have approved the merger; or 



with Multilinks consent, the holder delivers to Multilink a written withdrawal of such holders demand for purchase of the shares. 

To the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 of the General Corporation Law
of California prevent the payment to any holders of dissenting shares of the fair market value of the dissenting shares, the dissenting shareholders will become creditors of Multilink for the amount that they otherwise would have received in the
repurchase of their dissenting shares, plus interest at the legal rate on judgments until the date of payment, but subordinate to all other creditors in any liquidation proceeding, with the debt to be payable when permissible under the provisions of
Chapter 5 of the General Corporation Law of California. 

For
federal income tax purposes, Multilink shareholders who receive cash for their shares of Multilink stock after exercising dissenters rights will recognize taxable gain or loss. See Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger.

Listing on Nasdaq of Vitesse common stock to be issued in the merger 

Vitesse has agreed to cause the shares of common stock to be issued in the merger to be listed for trading on The Nasdaq National Market. 

Delisting and deregistration of Multilink common stock after the merger 

If the merger is completed, Multilinks Class A common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 



THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

General 

The merger agreement contemplates the merger of Margaux Acquisition
Corporation, a subsidiary of Vitesse, with and into Multilink, with Multilink surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitesse. The merger will become effective at the effective time in accordance with the articles of merger to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of California. We anticipate that we will make these filings as soon as practicable after the last of the conditions precedent to the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement, has been satisfied or
waived. The merger agreement obligates Vitesse to have the shares of Vitesse common stock to be issued in connection with the merger listed for trading on The Nasdaq National Market. The following description of the merger agreement may not contain
all the information about it that is important to you. We thus encourage you to refer to the merger agreement itself, which we attach as Annex A and incorporate by reference. 

Merger Consideration 

At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Multilink Class A and Class B common stock will be converted into the right to
receive 0.5493 shares of Vitesse common stock. Any share of Multilink Class A or Class B common stock held by Multilink as treasury shares will be canceled and retired. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Vitesse common stock that
would otherwise be issuable. 

Exchange of Shares 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Vitesse will
deposit with an exchange agent designated by Vitesse and reasonably acceptable to Multilink certificates representing the shares of Vitesse common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Multilink common stock and will deposit
cash in an amount required to be paid for fractional shares of Vitesse common stock and dividends and other distributions on the shares of Vitesse common stock. As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, Vitesse will send, or
will cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder of Multilink common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions. Thereafter, holders of shares of Multilink common stock may surrender their certificates to the exchange agent, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal. In exchange for the share certificates, holders will receive Vitesse common stock certificates representing the number of shares as described under Merger Consideration. Holders of unexchanged
shares of Multilink common stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions payable by Vitesse with respect to those shares of Vitesse common stock until the applicable Multilink certificate is surrendered. Upon surrender
and subject to applicable laws, however, those holders will receive accumulated dividends and distributions, without interest, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares. 

Vitesse will not issue fractional shares of common stock in the merger. For each fractional share that would otherwise be
issued, the exchange agent will pay the holder an amount equal to the fractional part of a share of Vitesse common stock multiplied by the average closing Vitesse stock price on the five trading days immediately preceding the effective time of the
merger. 



Stock Options and Warrants 

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option and warrant to purchase Multilink common stock, regardless of
the extent vested and exercisable, shall be assumed by Vitesse and become an option or warrant, as applicable, to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Multilink stock option or warrant, the same number of shares of
Vitesse common stock as the holder of the Multilink option or warrant would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement, had the holder exercised the Multilink option or warrant in full immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent and shall equal: 



the aggregate exercise price for the Multilink common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to the Multilink option or warrant, divided by 



the aggregate number of shares of Vitesse common stock deemed purchasable pursuant to the Multilink option or warrant in accordance with the foregoing. 

Vitesse has agreed to take all action necessary to implement the above,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of a sufficient number of shares of Vitesse common stock for delivery upon exercise of these assumed options and warrants. Vitesse shall cause the Vitesse common stock issuable upon exercise of these
options and warrants to be covered by a registration statement and maintain its effectiveness for so long as the options and warrants remain outstanding. 

Restricted stock 

Each share of Multilink Class A common stock which is unvested and has been issued pursuant to any Multilink stock option plan shall, upon the closing of
the merger, be converted into the right to receive the number of unvested shares of Vitesse common stock determined pursuant to the same exchange ratio applicable to all outstanding shares of Multilink common stock. Such unvested shares of Vitesse
common stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the unvested shares of Multilink Class A common stock under each corresponding Multilink stock option plan and the terms of the stock issuance agreements governing
such unvested Multilink shares. 

Vitesse has agreed that
unvested shares of Multilink Class A common stock held by employees of Multilink who are terminated without cause after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the closing of the merger will become fully vested immediately upon the
employees termination. 

Representations and Warranties 

The merger agreement contains a number of representations and warranties
of Vitesse and Multilink as to, among other things, due incorporation and valid existence, corporate authority and required shareholder approvals to enter into the contemplated transactions, required consents and filings with government entities,
absence of conflicts with organizational documents and material agreements, capitalization, ownership of subsidiaries, reports filed with the SEC, financial statements, information supplied for use in this document, material contracts, material
changes or events, undisclosed liabilities, compliance with laws, litigation, finders fees, opinion of financial advisor, tax matters, employee benefit plans, environmental matters and intellectual property. 

Many of these representations and warranties are qualified by the absence of
a material adverse effect, which, for purposes of the merger agreement, means with respect to Vitesse or Multilink, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or results of operations of
such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than a change in the market price or trading volume of either partys stock, adverse changes or conditions affecting the telecommunications equipment industry or general economic
conditions, changes in laws, rules, regulations or accounting requirements or principles or any adverse change or effect, including any litigation, loss of employees, cancellation of or delay in customer orders, reductions in revenues or income or
disruption of business relationships, arising from or attributable to the announcement or 



pendency of the merger, compliance with the terms or the taking of any action, or omitting to take any action, pursuant to, as required by or in accordance
with the merger agreement or the taking of any action by Multilink after obtaining the written consent or approval of Vitesse in accordance with the merger agreement. 

The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time of the merger. 

Principal Covenants 

Interim Operations of Multilink.
    Multilink has undertaken a covenant that places restrictions
on it and its subsidiaries until either the effective time or termination of the merger agreement. In general, Multilink and its subsidiaries are required to conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to preserve
intact their present business organizations and relationships with third parties. 

Multilink has also agreed to some specific restrictions that are subject to exceptions described in the merger agreement. These restrictions include prohibitions against: 



amending its organizational documents; 



entering into certain significant transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or material acquisition or disposition; 



taking any action that would make any representation and warranty inaccurate in any respect; 



changes to the vesting and exercisability provisions of equity compensation arrangements; 



repurchase or redemption of outstanding Multilink common stock; 



incurrence of material indebtedness;

material increase in compensation or severance benefits for employees; and 



certain other matters. 

Vitesse and Multilink have agreed to cooperate with each other and take actions and do all things necessary or advisable under the merger agreement and
applicable laws to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

No Solicitation by Multilink.
    Multilink has agreed that it and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors will not take action to solicit or encourage an offer for an alternative acquisition transaction involving Multilink of a nature defined in the merger agreement.

Restricted actions include engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with any potential bidder, disclosing any nonpublic information relating to Multilink or any of its subsidiaries or affording access to their properties, books or records to any potential bidder, granting any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of Multilinks equity securities, or entering into any agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal, other than in the manner contemplated below. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restricted actions described in the
previous paragraph are permitted in response to an unsolicited bona fide offer so long as, before doing so: (1) the Multilink board of directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consulting with its financial advisor and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the offer, that the offer is a superior proposal, which is defined in the merger agreement to mean any bona fide, written acquisition proposal for over 51% of the outstanding Multilink common shares or a sale
of Multilink assets representing over 51% of the value of the business on terms that are more favorable and provide greater value to Multilinks shareholders than the merger; (2) Multilink has otherwise complied with the no 



solicitation restrictions discussed above, as well as with the notice requirement specified below; and (3) Multilinks board of directors
determines in good faith by a majority vote after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it must take the action in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. In addition, before providing non-public information,
Multilink must receive from the person making the offer an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to Multilink that those in the existing confidentiality agreement between Vitesse and Multilink. In addition, Multilink may not
enter into any agreement with respect to any third party offer without first complying with the further restrictions discussed below. 

Multilink must keep Vitesse informed of the identity of any potential bidder and the terms and status of any offer. 

Multilink Boards Covenant to
Recommend.
    The Multilink board of directors has agreed to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger agreement to Multilinks shareholders. The board, however, can withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to
Vitesse, its recommendation if: (1) Multilink has otherwise complied with the no solicitation restrictions discussed above under No Solicitation by Multilink; (2) a superior proposal is pending at the time; (3) the board determines
in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it must take the action to comply with its fiduciary duties to its shareholders; and (4) it delivers prior written notice to Vitesse that it intends to take
this action. 

Vitesse may terminate the merger agreement if
Multilinks board of directors fails to make or withdraws its recommendation of merger with Vitesse or if it fails to call the meeting of its shareholders. The circumstances in which the merger agreement may be terminated are described more
fully below under the heading Termination. 

Indemnification and Insurance.
    These provisions of the merger agreement are discussed above under the heading Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of Multilink in the
MergerIndemnification, Directors and Officers Insurance. 

Benefits Continuation.
    Vitesse has agreed that it will provide, for employees of Multilink and its subsidiaries, benefits under employee benefits plans that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to those provided by Vitesse to its employees. 

Certain Other Covenants.
    The merger agreement contains additional mutual covenants, including cooperation regarding filings with governmental and other agencies and organizations and obtaining any governmental
or third-party consents or approvals, public announcements, further assurances, access to information, mutual notification of particular events, confidential treatment of non-public information and actions to be taken so as not to jeopardize the
intended tax or accounting treatment of the merger.

The percentage of shares beneficially owned is based on 5,274,000 shares of Class A common stock and 2,600,000 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of July 15, 2003.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Shares of common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after July 15, 2003 are deemed to be outstanding and
beneficially owned by the person holding such options for the purpose of computing the number of shares beneficially owned and the percentage ownership of such person, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table, and subject to applicable community property laws, such persons have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Multilink common stock shown as
beneficially owned by them. 

(2)

Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock is

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF 

MULTILINK COMMON STOCK AND VITESSE COMMON STOCK 

Multilink is incorporated under the laws of the State of California and
Vitesse is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The rights of Multilink shareholders are governed by the General Corporation Law of California, Multilinks amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and
Multilinks amended and restated bylaws. The rights of Multilinks shareholders who receive Vitesse shares as a result of the merger, will be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, Vitesses amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, and Vitesses bylaws. The following discussion summarizes certain material differences between the rights of holders of Multilink common stock and Vitesse common stock resulting from the differences in their governing
documents and California and Delaware law. 

The following
summary is not a complete summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to governing corporate documents of Vitesse and Multilink and applicable law. See Where You Can Find Additional Information on page 110. 

Capitalization 

Multilink 

The total authorized shares of capital stock of Multilink consist of (1) 200,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $.0001 par value, (2) 100,000,000
shares of Class B common stock, $.0001 par value; and (3) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.0001 par value. 

The shares of Multilink Class B common stock are substantially identical to the shares of Multilink Class A common stock, except that the holders of Class
A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to shareholder vote. Holders of shares of Class A common stock and holders of shares of Class B
common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a shareholder vote, except (1) as otherwise required by law or (2) with respect to a proposed issuance of additional shares of Class B common stock, which issuance requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting separately as a class. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock and
will, in general, automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon sale or other transfer to any person or entity other than a person or entity that owns or controls an entity that owns Class B common stock. 

Multilinks amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended,
provide that shares of Multilinks preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, and authorize the board of directors to determine the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions,
of the preferred stock. Multilinks amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize the board of directors to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares
of such series then outstanding. 

Vitesse

The total authorized shares of capital stock of
Vitesse consist of (1) 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, and (2) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. 

Vitesses amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of Vitesse preferred stock may be issued from time to time, in one
or more series. Vitesses amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that shares of Vitesse preferred stock, and each series thereof, will have the designations, powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions set forth in the resolutions of the board of directors. The Vitesse board of directors is authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of such series, but not
above the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock and not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. 



Vitesse currently has designated 500,000 shares of Series A participating cumulative preferred stock,
none of which is outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock is issuable in connection with the Vitesse rights plan, discussed below. Holders of Vitesse Series A
participating cumulative preferred stock will be entitled to quarterly cash dividends when, as and if declared by the Vitesse board of directors out of legally available funds, subject to any superior rights of other holders of preferred stock, upon
declaration of cash dividends on Vitesse common stock. If no dividend is declared on the Vitesse common stock in a given quarter, a dividend of $1.00 per outstanding share of Series A participating cumulative preferred stock shall be declared.
Unpaid dividends will accrue. Each outstanding share of Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock will have 1,000 votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of Vitesse stockholders, voting as a single class with the Vitesse
common stock, except as otherwise provided by law. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Vitesse, holders of Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock will be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share equal to
1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Vitesse common stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock. In any
consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction involving an exchange of Vitesse common stock, the shares of Series A participating cumulative preferred stock will be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share equal to 1,000 times
the aggregate amount of consideration into which or for which each share of Vitesse common stock is changed or exchanged. The Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock is not redeemable and will rank junior to all other series of
Vitesse preferred stock unless the terms of any other series provides otherwise. 

Number, election, vacancy and removal of directors 

Multilink 

Multilinks amended and
restated bylaws provide that the authorized number of directors cannot be less than four or more than seven, as determined by the board from time to time. Multilink currently has six directors. All directors are elected at each annual meeting of
shareholders to serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors have been elected and qualified. An amendment to Multilinks amended and restated bylaws that would reduce the minimum number of directors to less than five cannot
be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a shareholders meeting or the shares not consenting to an action by written consent are equal to or more than 16

/

 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors only if Multilink is not a listed corporation (as
such term is defined in Section 301.5(d) of the General Corporation Law of California). Under cumulative voting, if any shareholder has given timely notice of an intention to cumulate votes for the election of directors, such shareholder and any
other shareholder of the corporation would be entitled to cumulate his or her votes at such election. Cumulative voting provides that each share of stock normally having one vote is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of directors to
be elected. A shareholder may then cast all such votes for a single candidate or may allocate them among as many candidates as the shareholder may choose. Since Multilink is a listed corporation, its shareholders are not entitled to cumulate their
votes for candidates in an election of directors. 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide that except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the remaining directors at a properly noticed meeting, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Multilinks amended and restated bylaws further provide that vacancies occurring in the board by reason
of the removal of directors may be filled only by approval of the shareholders. Any election by written consent of the shareholders to fill a vacancy created by removal requires the consent of all the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 



Vitesse 

Vitesses amended and restated certificate of incorporation, provides that the number of directors is to be designated
in the bylaws of Vitesse. Vitesses bylaws provide that the board of directors will consist of five members, but may be changed by a duly adopted amendment to Vitesses bylaws or amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware
law permits a board of directors, acting alone, to change the authorized number of directors in the manner provided in the bylaws, unless the number of directors is fixed in the certificate of incorporation (in which case a change in the number of
directors may be made only by amendment to the certificate of incorporation following approval of such change by stockholders). Vitesses bylaws provide that all directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to serve until
the next annual meeting and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Vitesses amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors. 

Vitesses bylaws provide that vacancies in the board of directors may be
filled by a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; provided, however, that a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the stockholders for cause, may be filled by a majority of
directors then in office or by the stockholders. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that if, at the time of filling any vacancy, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the board (as constituted immediately prior
to any increase), the Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any holder or holders of at least ten percent of the total number of the outstanding stock having the right to vote for directors, summarily order a special election to be
held to fill the vacancy or to replace directors chosen by the board to fill the vacancies. 

Vitesses bylaws provide that any director may be removed from office, with or without cause, by a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors, provided that, so long as stockholders are
entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire
board of directors. 

Amendments to charter documents and bylaws

Multilink 

Under California law, a proposed amendment to a corporations articles
of incorporation generally requires approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide that they may be amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of
shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote or by the board of directors; provided, however, that, a bylaw specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to
a variable board, or vice versa, may only be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

Vitesse 

The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that approval of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon is required to amend a
certificate of incorporation. 

Vitesses bylaws may be
amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders entitled to vote and Vitesses amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to adopt, alter, amend or repeal Vitesses bylaws.



Action by written consent 

Multilink 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide that any action which may be taken at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and
without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.

Vitesse 

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, any action which may be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if written consents for the action so taken are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all stock entitled to vote were present and voted. However, the Vitesse amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides
that following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of Vitesse pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
Vitesses common stock was registered in 1991. 

Notice of shareholder
actions 

Multilink 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide that written notice of
the date, time, place and purpose of every meeting of shareholders must be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail or other means of written communication to each shareholder entitled
to vote. 

Multilinks amended and restated bylaws further
provide that any proper matter may be presented at the annual meeting of shareholders for action, but action on the following matters will be valid only if the proposal was stated in the notice of the meeting or in a written notice, unless the
matter was unanimously approved by those entitled to vote: 



the approval of a contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors or with any corporation, firm or association in which one or more of its
directors has a material financial interest; 



an amendment to its articles of incorporation; 



a reorganization (as defined in Section 181 of the California General Corporation Law) required to be approved by Section 1201 of the California General Corporation Law;



the voluntary winding up and dissolution of the corporation; or 



a plan of distribution under Section 2007 of the California General Corporation Law in respect of a corporation in the process of winding up. 



Vitesse 

Vitesses bylaws provide that a written notice of the place, date, time and purpose of all meetings of stockholders
must be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting, either personally or by mail or other means of written communication, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Vitesses bylaws further
provide that only such business may be conducted as has been properly brought before a meeting of stockholders. To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, the business must be: 



specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the board of directors; 



otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors; or 



otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. 

Special shareholder meetings 

Multilink 

Pursuant to Multilinks amended and restated bylaws, a special meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of directors, the chairman of the
board, the President of Multilink, the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at such meeting or such additional persons as are authorized by Multilinks restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated
bylaws. 

Vitesse 

Vitesses bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may
be called only by Vitesses president or chief executive officer, Vitesses board of directors or the chairman of Vitesses board of directors, or a holder of more than 10% of Vitesse common stock, and that such persons may call a
special meeting of stockholders at any time. Vitesses bylaws further provide that only such business may be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as has been stated in the notice for such meeting. 

Shareholder inspection rights; shareholder lists 

Multilink 

California law and Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide that
the accounting books and records of Multilink, and minutes of proceedings of the shareholders, the board of the directors and committees of the board of directors must be open to inspection during usual business hours upon the written demand of any
shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate, for a purpose reasonably related to his interests as a shareholder or as the holder of a voting trust certificate. In addition, California law and Multilinks amended and restated bylaws
provide for an absolute right to inspect and copy the corporations shareholder list by persons holding an aggregate of five percent or more of the corporations voting shares, or shareholders who hold an aggregate of one percent or more
of such shares and have filed a Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Vitesse 

Under
Delaware law, any stockholder, in person or by attorney or other agent, may, upon written demand given under oath and stating the purpose thereof, inspect for any proper purpose a corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its
other books and records. A proper purpose is a purpose reasonably related to such persons interest as a stockholder. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders must be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to such meeting. The list must also be kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. 



Monetary liability of directors 

Multilinks amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and Vitesses amended and restated
certificate of incorporation each provide for elimination of personal monetary liability of directors for breach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permissible under the laws of California and Delaware, respectively. The laws of California and
Delaware permit corporations to adopt a provision in their charter documents eliminating the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of the directors fiduciary duty of care to the
corporation and its shareholders. Neither state permits the elimination of liability for breaches of loyalty, for bad faith conduct, for intentional misconduct, transactions from which the director derives an improper benefit, or for the unlawful
payment of dividends, stock purchases or redemptions. California, in addition, prohibits the elimination of liability for conduct that would constitute the reckless disregard of a directors duty to the corporation or its shareholders where the
director in the ordinary course of performing a directors duties should have been aware of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders, for conduct that would constitute the directors abdication of duty in connection
with transactions in which the director is an interested party, and in addition to prohibiting the elimination of liability for the unlawful payment of dividends, stock purchases or redemptions, prohibiting the elimination of liability for improper
loans or guarantees. 

Indemnification of directors and officers

Multilink 

Under California law, (a) a corporation has the power to indemnify any
person who was or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines and settlements (other than in connection with actions by or in the
right of the corporation) if that person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of
the person was unlawful, and (b) a corporation has the power to indemnify, with certain exceptions, any person who is a party to any action by or in the right of the corporation, against expenses actually or reasonably incurred by that person in
connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. In addition, California law allows a corporation to
advance payment on an indemnitees expenses prior to the final disposition of an action, provided that the indemnitee undertakes to repay any such amount advanced if it is later determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
with regard to the action for which the expenses were advanced. As described above, Multilinks amended and restated bylaws provide for the indemnification of Multilinks directors and officers to the maximum extent and in the manner
permitted by California law. 

The indemnification expressly
authorized by California law and described above is not exclusive, and a corporation may grant its directors, officers, employees or other agents certain additional rights to indemnification. Multilinks restated articles of incorporation
permit indemnification to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by California law. 

Vitesse 

Vitesses bylaws provide that the corporation will, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, indemnify any person against expenses, judgments, fine, and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the corporation. Vitesses bylaws define a director or officer as any person (1) who is or was a director or officer of Vitesse, (2) who is or was serving at the request of Vitesse as a director or
officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (3) who was a director of officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of Vitesse 



or another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. Vitesses bylaws only require the corporation to indemnify a director or officer
in connection with a proceeding initiated by the director or officer if the initiation of the proceeding by the director or officer was authorized by Vitesses board of directors. 

Vitesses bylaws provide that Vitesse will pay the expenses incurred by a director or officer who is entitled to
indemnification under Vitesses bylaws in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, only if such director or officer agrees to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to
indemnification. 

Vitesses bylaws further provide that
the rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition are not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
the Vitesse amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

Vitesses bylaws also provide that Vitesse may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
Vitesse or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not Vitesse would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
Delaware law. 

Vitesses bylaws allow the corporation to
indemnify its employees and agents with the same scope and effect as the indemnification of directors and officers.

Dividends 

Multilink 

Under California law, a corporation may not make any distribution to its shareholders unless either: (i) the corporations retained earnings
immediately prior to the proposed distribution equal or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution; or (ii) immediately after giving effect to such distribution, the corporations assets (exclusive of goodwill, capitalized research and
development expenses and deferred charges) would be at least equal to 1

/

 times its liabilities (not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred credits), and the corporations current assets would be at
least equal to its current liabilities (or 1

/

 times its current liabilities if the average pre-tax and pre-interest expense earnings for the preceding two fiscal years were less than the average interest expense for such
years). Such tests are applied to California corporations on a consolidated basis. In addition, under California law, a corporation may not make a distribution to its shareholders if the corporation is, or would be as a result of the distribution,
likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. 

Vitesse 

Delaware law provides that a corporation may pay dividends out of its surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Delaware law also
provides that dividends may not be paid out of the net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, the corporations capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference
upon the distribution of assets. 

Conversion 

Holders of Multilink Class A common stock and Vitesse common stock have no
rights to convert their shares into any other securities. Each share of Multilink Class B common stock is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock and will, in general, automatically convert into one share of
Class A common stock at the option of the holder and upon sale or other transfer to any person or entity other than a person or entity that owns or controls an entity that owns Class B common stock. 



Shareholder approval of certain business combinations 

Multilink 

California law provides that holders of nonredeemable common stock must
receive nonredeemable common stock in a merger of the corporation with a holder of more than 50% but less than 90% of such corporations common stock or such holders affiliate, unless all of the holders of such common stock consent to the
transaction or it is approved by the California Department of Corporations at a fairness hearing. California law also provides that, in certain circumstances, when a tender offer or proposal for a reorganization or sale of assets is made by an
interested party, an affirmative opinion in writing as to the fairness of the consideration to be paid to the shareholders must be delivered to the shareholders. Further, if a tender of shares or vote is sought pursuant to an interested partys
proposal, and a later proposal is made by another party at least 10 days prior to the date of acceptance of the interested party proposal, the shareholders must be informed of the later offer and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to withdraw any
vote, consent or proxy, or to withdraw any tendered shares. 

Vitesse 

Vitesse is subject to the
anti-takeover provisions in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These anti-takeover provisions prohibit business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an interested stockholder, as described below, within three years of
the time the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder unless: 



before that time, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder;



upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation,
excluding shares held by directors who are also officers of the corporation and by employee stock ownership plans that do not permit employees to determine confidentially whether shares held by the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
offer; or 



on or following that time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and the business combination transaction is approved by the holders of at least

/

% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. 

The anti-takeover provisions do not apply to a business combination that: 



is proposed after the public announcement of, and before the consummation or abandonment of 



a merger or consolidation of the corporation; 



a sale of 50% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all
outstanding shares of the corporation; or 



a tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation. 



is with a person who either was not an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of the board of directors;
and 



is approved by a majority of the current directors who were also directors before any person became an interested stockholder during the previous three years.

An interested stockholder generally
is defined as a person that owns 15% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of that person. 



The term business combination includes the following transactions with an interested
stockholder: 



a merger or consolidation of the corporation with an interested stockholder; 



any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, except proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation, of assets of the corporation or its
subsidiaries having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of either the aggregate market value of all assets of the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding
stock of the corporation; 



any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation or its subsidiaries of stock of the corporation or the subsidiary to the interested stockholder, except
for transactions involving the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities outstanding before the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and certain other transactions which do not increase the interested stockholders
proportionate share of any class or series of the corporations stock; 



any transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries which increases the proportionate share of any class or series of stock, or securities convertible into the
stock of any class or series, of the corporation or any subsidiary which is owned by the interested stockholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any shares
of stock not caused by the interested stockholder; or 



any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, except proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation, of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial
benefits provided by the corporation or its subsidiaries. 

There is no equivalent provision to Section 203 in California. 

Shareholder rights plan 

Multilink

Multilink does not have a shareholder rights plan.

Vitesse 

Vitesse maintains a stockholder rights plan that is designed to protect
stockholders from attempts to acquire control of the company without the approval of the companys board and prevent abusive tactics by potential acquirers. 

The rights issued under the plan are not currently exercisable or transferable, and no separate certificates evidencing such
rights will be distributed unless certain events, described below, occur. The plan may cause substantial dilution to certain persons or groups that beneficially acquire 15% or more of Vitesses common stock, unless the rights issuable under the
plan are first redeemed by Vitesses board of directors. A summary of the key provisions of the plan is provided below. 

Vitesse adopted a stockholders rights plan in February 2003, pursuant to which the Vitesse board declared a dividend of one Vitesse right for each
outstanding share of Vitesse common stock. Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. has been appointed to serve as rights agent. Each Vitesse right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Vitesse Series A participating
cumulative preferred stock at a price of $20, subject to adjustment. The terms of the rights are fully described in the Rights Agreement between Vitesse and the rights agent. 



Until the distribution date under the rights agreement, described below, the rights attach to and trade
only together with the shares of Vitesse common stock. The rights will separate from shares of Vitesse common stock and become exercisable, and certificates representing the rights will be issued, upon the earlier of the following events, which we
refer to as the distribution date: 



ten days after public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
the outstanding Vitesse common stock, referred to as a triggering event; or 



ten days, or such later date as the Vitesse board may determine, after the announcement or commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group
having beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Vitesse common stock. 

Any person or group of affiliated or associated persons who beneficially owns 15% of the outstanding Vitesse common stock, other than Vitesse and certain
of Vitesses affiliates, is referred to as a 15% acquirer. 

After the distribution date, rights certificates will be mailed to recordholders of Vitesse common stock as of the distribution date. The rights will expire on the earliest of: 



February 7, 2013; or 



redemption or exchange of the rights. 

Following the distribution date, and until one of the further events described below occurs, each right will entitle the holder to receive, for payment of
the rights purchase price of $20, one one-thousandth of a share of Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock. For a description of Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock, refer to the subheading entitled
CapitalizationVitesse above. If a triggering event has occurred, Vitesse may, at the option of the Vitesse board, instead substitute cash, assets or other securities for Series A participating cumulative preferred stock issuable
upon exercise of rights. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a triggering event, any rights held by a 15% acquirer will be void. 

Unless the rights are earlier redeemed, after a triggering event occurs, each holder of a Vitesse right, other than a 15% acquirer, whose rights will be
void, will have the right to receive, upon exercise and payment of the rights purchase price, Vitesse common stock having a value equal to two times the purchase price of the rights; provided that if Vitesse does not have the sufficient common stock
available to for all rights to be exercised and the Vitesse board determines it to be necessary or appropriate and not contrary to the interests of rights holders, cash, assets or other securities may be substituted for common stock. 

Unless the rights are earlier redeemed, if, after a triggering event,



Vitesse is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or 



50% or more of Vitesses consolidated assets or earning power are sold other than in the ordinary course of business, 

each outstanding Vitesse right, other than rights owned by the 15% acquirer, will become
exercisable for shares of common stock of the acquiring company with a value equal to two times the rights exercise price. 

At any time prior to a triggering event, the Vitesse board may exchange all or part of the then outstanding rights for rights of substantially equivalent
value, as it determines reasonably and in good faith based upon the advice of one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms. 

At any time after a triggering event and before the acquisition by such 15% acquirer of 50% or more of the outstanding Vitesse common stock, the Vitesse
board may exchange the rights, other than rights owned by the 15% acquirer, in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Vitesse common stock per right. Upon an 



action by the Vitesse board ordering an exchange, the rights will terminate and the holders of the rights will be entitled only to receive shares of common
stock in accordance with the exchange ratio. If Vitesse does not have sufficient common stock available for all rights to be exchanged, the Vitesse board may, at its option, exchange rights for cash, assets or other securities instead of for common
stock. 

At any time before the earlier of the tenth day
following acquisition by a 15% acquirer and February 7, 2013, the Vitesse board may redeem the rights in whole, but not part, for $0.001 per right, as adjusted, payable in cash or shares of Vitesse common stock based on the market price of the
common stock. Following the Vitesse boards order of redemption, the rights will terminate and the holders of the rights will be entitled only to receive the determined redemption price. 

No fractional portion less than integral multiples of one share of Vitesse
common stock will be issued upon exercise or exchange of a right. In place of the issuance of a fractional share, a cash adjustment will be made based on the market price of Vitesse common stock on the last trading date before the date of exercise
or exchange. 

The rights agreement may be supplemented or
amended by the Vitesse board before a distribution date without the approval of holders of rights. After a distribution date, the rights agreement may be amended by the Vitesse board to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to make changes
that do not adversely affect the interests of holders of rights, other than a 15% acquirer, or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the rights agreement to protect, enhance or clarify the rights and/or benefits of rights holders, other than
a 15% acquirer; except no amendment to adjust the time period governing redemption may be made when the rights are not redeemable. 

The Vitesse Series A participating cumulative preferred stock is only issuable in connection with the rights plan. For a description of the Vitesse Series
A participating cumulative preferred stock, refer to the subheading entitled CapitalizationVitesse above. 

This description of the rights plan is qualified by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus. See 
Where You Can Find Additional Information on page 110. 

Mergers, sales
of assets and other transactions 

Multilink

Under California law, the principal terms of a merger
must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon, except that, unless required by a corporations articles of incorporation, no authorizing shareholder vote is required of a
corporation surviving a merger if the shareholders of such corporation own, immediately after the merger, more than five-sixths of the voting power of the surviving corporation or its parent. Multilinks amended and restated articles of
incorporation, as amended, do not require a greater percentage vote. California law further requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon if (a) the surviving corporations articles of
incorporation will be amended and would otherwise require shareholder approval or (b) shareholders of such corporation will receive shares of the surviving corporation having different rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions (including
shares in a foreign corporation) than the shares surrendered. Shareholder approval is not required under California law for mergers or consolidations in which a parent corporation merges or consolidates with a subsidiary of which it owns at least
90% of the outstanding shares of each class of stock. 

Vitesse 

Under Delaware law, mergers or
consolidations or sales or exchanges of all or substantially all of a corporations assets or a dissolution of the corporation require the affirmative vote of the board of directors (except in certain limited circumstances). In addition, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock 



of the corporation entitled to vote on the matter is required, except in certain cases where stockholder approval is not required by a corporations
certificate of incorporation. 

Under Delaware law, stockholder
consent is not required under the following circumstances: 



for a corporation that survives a merger and does not issue in the merger more than 20% of its outstanding shares immediately prior to the merger; 



if the merger agreement does not amend in any respect the survivors certificate of incorporation; 



if each share of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior to the merger remains an identical outstanding share of the surviving corporation after the merger; and



for either corporation where one corporation owns 90% of each class of outstanding stock of the other corporation. 

Appraisal rights 

Multilink 

Under California law, dissenters rights are available to holders of a class of shares which are not listed on a national securities exchange or The
Nasdaq National Market and are available to holders of a class of shares listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq National Market if demands for payment are filed with respect to at least five percent of the outstanding shares of that
listed class or there exists any restriction on transfer of such listed shares imposed by the corporation or by any law or regulation. Appraisal rights are also unavailable if the shareholders of a corporation or the corporation itself, or both,
immediately prior to the reorganization will own immediately after the reorganization equity securities constituting more than five-sixths (or 83.3%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring corporation or its parent entity. For more
detailed information regarding appraisal rights, see the section titled California Dissenters Rights on page 55. A copy of the text of Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law, which sets forth the appraisal rights of
Multilink shareholders, is attached as Annex D. 

Vitesse

Under Delaware law, a stockholder of a corporation
participating in certain major corporate transactions may, under varying circumstances, be entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to which the stockholder may receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of his or her shares in lieu of the
consideration he or she would otherwise receive in the transaction. Unless a corporations certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, these appraisal rights are not available: 



with respect to the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, 



with respect to a merger or consolidation by the corporation the shares of which are either listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq National Market or are held of record
by more than 2,000 holders if the terms of the merger of consolidation allow the stockholders to receive only shares of the surviving corporation or shares of any other corporation that are either listed on a national securities exchange or on
Nasdaq National Market or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, or 



to stockholders of the corporation surviving a merger if no vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation is required to approve the merger because the merger agreement does
not amend the existing certificate of incorporation, each share of the surviving corporation outstanding prior to the merger is converted into an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger, and the number of share to be issued in the
merger does not exceed 20% of the shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior to the merger and if some other conditions are met. 



Vitesse stockholders are not entitled to exercise appraisal rights as a result of the merger or to demand
cash payment for their shares. 

Loans to directors, officers and employees

The Delaware General Corporation Law permits Vitesse to
make loans to, guarantee the obligations of, or otherwise assist its officers or other employees when that action, in the judgment of the directors, may reasonably be expected to benefit Vitesse. 

Under the General Corporation Law of California, any loan to, or guaranty for
the benefit of, a director or officer, including pursuant to an employee benefit plan, of the corporation requires approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation. However, the General Corporation Law of California and
Multilinks bylaws provide that if a corporation has 100 or more shareholders of record, the Multilink board alone may approve loans, to or guaranties on behalf of, an officer, whether or not the officer is a director, or adopt an employee
benefit plan authorizing the loans or guaranties, by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of any interested director or directors, if the Multilink board determines that the loan, guaranty or plan may reasonably be expected to benefit the
corporation. 

Notwithstanding the Delaware General Corporation
Law and the General Corporation Law of California, however, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits both Vitesse and Multilink from extending any personal loans to, or arrange credit for, any director or executive officer. 

Interested director transactions 

Under the laws of both California and Delaware, contracts or transactions
between a corporation and one or more of its directors or between a corporation and any other entity in which one or more of its directors are directors or have a financial interest, are not void or voidable because of the interest or because the
director is present at a meeting of the board which authorizes or approves the contract or transaction, provided that specific conditions, such as obtaining the required approval and fulfilling the requirements of good faith and full disclosure, are
met. With specific exceptions, the conditions are similar under the General Corporation Law of California and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under the General Corporation Law of California and the Delaware General Corporation Law, either (1)
the shareholders or the board of directors must approve the contract or transaction in good faith after full disclosure of the material facts and, in the case of board approval other than for a common directorship, the General Corporation Law of
California requires that the contract or transaction must also be just and reasonable to the corporation, or (2) the contract or transaction must have been fair (in Delaware) or, in the case of a common directorship (in California), just and
reasonable as to the corporation at that time it was approved. The General Corporation Law of California explicitly places the burden of proof of the just and reasonable nature of the contract or transaction on the interested director. 

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, if board approval is sought,
the contract or transaction must be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, even though less than a majority of a quorum. Under the General Corporation Law of California, if shareholder approval is sought, the interested director is
not entitled to vote his or her shares at a shareholders meeting with respect to any action regarding the contract or transaction. If board approval is sought, the contract or transaction must be approved by a majority vote of a quorum of the
directors, without counting the vote of any interested directors, except that interested directors may be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. 

Shareholder derivative suit 

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a person may only bring a derivative action on behalf of the corporation if the person was a stockholder of
the corporation at the time of the transaction in question or his or her stock devolved upon him or her by operation of law after the transaction. The General Corporation Law of 



California provides that a shareholder bringing a derivative action on behalf of the a corporation need not have been a shareholder at the time of the
transaction in question, provided that specific criteria are met. The General Corporation Law of California also provides that the corporation or the defendant in a derivative suit may, under specific circumstances, make a motion to the court for an
order requiring the plaintiff shareholder to furnish a security bond. Delaware law does not have a similar bonding requirement. 

Dissolution 

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a dissolution must be approved by the written consent of stockholders holding 100% of the total voting power
or the dissolution must be initiated by the Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders of the corporation. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation, in the event of such a Board-initiated dissolution, to include in its certificate of
incorporation a super-majority voting requirement for the board and stockholders in connection with a dissolution. Under the General Corporation Law of California, shareholders holding 50% or more of the total voting power may authorize a
corporations dissolution, with or without the approval of the corporations board of directors. The board may cause the corporation to dissolve if (1) an order for relief under Chapter 7 of the Federal bankruptcy law has been entered, (2)
no shares have been issued, or (3) the corporation has disposed of all of its assets and has not conducted any business for a period of five years preceding the adopting of a resolution to dissolve.



CERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING MULTILINK 

Business 

Multilink designs,
develops and markets advanced integrated circuits, modules and higher-level assemblies that enable next generation optical networking systems. Multilinks current products address the markets for DWDM and SONET/SDH optical networking equipment.
Multilink focuses on the fastest commercially available speeds of OC-192, or 10 gigabits per second, or higher, and are developing products that are designed to address systems for the Metro/Access and Enterprise markets. Multilink seeks to be first
to develop innovative products with system functions that allow communications equipment manufacturers to rapidly build and deliver high performance fiber optic systems ahead of their competitors. 

Realignment Plan 

In August 2002, Multilink announced a corporate realignment plan to create a more efficient cost structure and realign
Multilinks business to reflect the current telecommunication market environment, which will permit Multilink to focus its employees on Multilinks key business strategies. The major initiatives of the plan included a reduction of 40 to 45
percent in Multilinks worldwide headcount, the consolidation of facilities through the closure of certain locations and the reduction in the level of activity at other locations. During 2002, Multilink recorded an $11.0 million charge in
connection with this plan. During the three months ended December 31, 2002, Multilink expanded the plan by deciding to close facilities in addition to those already included in the charge recorded during the third quarter of 2002. During the three
months ended March 31, 2003, Multilink decided to accelerate the closure of one of its facilities. When Multilink originally recorded the realignment charge for this closure during 2002, Multilink had planned on closing this facility sometime during
the middle of 2003. As a result of Multilinks decision to accelerate the closure date to March 30, 2003, Multilink recorded severance and lease expenses of $0.2 million in excess of its original estimates. Multilink has estimated that the
total cash cost of the realignment plan is approximately $4.7 million. The estimated remaining cash outflows related to the plan are expected to be $2.2 million in 2003, less than $0.6 million in 2004 and $0.7 million thereafter. The estimated cash
outflow related to the plan will, however, be negatively impacted if it takes Multilink longer than anticipated to sublease some of its closed facilities or if Multilinks planned further headcount reductions are delayed. 

Based upon headcount reduction associated with Multilinks realignment
plan, attrition in the normal course of business and headcount reductions as a result of Multilinks continuing efforts to reduce expense across all functions, Multilinks headcount has decreased to 157 employees as of March 31, 2003.
During the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, Multilink decided to make further headcount reductions to reduce headcount to 60 employees by September 2003. Based upon Multilinks actual revenues being below managements expectations,
coupled with having very limited visibility to future revenues, Multilink concluded that these reductions in headcount were necessary in order to reduce cash usage and to position Multilink for the future. Accordingly, during the second quarter
ended June 30, 2003, Multilink will record additional severance and termination benefit charges of approximately $1.5 million associated with attaining the 60 employee level by September 2003 and asset impairment charges associated predominantly
with purchased research and development software. The headcount reductions have occurred at all of Multilinks locations in Europe, Israel and the United States. 



Products 

Multilink designs and develops advanced products targeted for use in high bandwidth optical networking systems. These products consist of integrated
circuits, modules and higher-level assemblies that generate, manipulate, transmit and receive electrical and optical signals. 

Multilinks products focus on three segments of optical networking systems: the physical media dependent layer, or PMD, the physical layer and the
datalink layer. Collectively, the products within these segments connect data processing devices to optical fiber and constitute an integral part of optical networking systems. 

The following is a diagram that shows the different functions required for fiber optic transmission systems: 

PMD devices perform the conversion
between electrical and optical signals and can be categorized as either transmitters or receivers. Transmitters convert voice and data transmissions carried as electrical signals into optical signals for transmission over optical fiber, while
receivers convert optical signals into electrical signals. Transmitters are composed of an electrical-to-optical, or E/O, converter, which converts electrical signals to optical pulses, and a driver, which amplifies and conditions signals for use by
the E/O converter. E/O converters are composed of a light source, or laser, and an external modulator, which creates individual pulses of light, or optical signals. Receivers consist of a semiconductor device that converts an optical signal into
electrical pulses, an optical-to-electrical, or O/E, converter, and a transimpedance amplifier, or TIA, which amplifies these electrical pulses. 

The physical layer is composed of mixed-signal devices, which include both digital and analog circuits and can be categorized as either multiplexers or
demultiplexers. Multiplexers combine multiple slower signals into a single high-speed signal, while demultiplexers perform the reverse function. 

Datalink layer devices connect the physical layer to networking equipment. Datalink layer devices have three primary functions: framing, mapping and
forward error correction, or FEC. In framing and mapping, which generally occur simultaneously, data is placed in formatted frames, prior to being transmitted over fiber, to make the data recognizable at the receiving end of the transmission. In
FEC, data is placed in special frames that can be used to correct errors that occur during transmission. 

Multilinks PMD Products 

There are two primary types of modulators: crystal-based modulators, which offer optimal performance for long-haul systems but consume significant power
and cannot be integrated with lasers; and semiconductor-based modulators, which use less power and can feature on-chip integration with lasers. Multilink currently produces several drivers for crystal-based modulators. These products have been
designed to improve signal quality and system efficiency. Multilink has developed Micro-Module
TM
 technology that
allows Multilink to integrate several high-speed devices into a single Ball Grid Array, or BGA, package, which is used in Multilinks next generation of PMD devices. 



Multilinks Physical Layer Products 

Multilink has broad experience in the production of physical layer products.
Multilink has designed its multiplexers with exceptionally low jitter, which is a type of noise in optical channels, directly improving signal quality and transmission distance. Multilink has designed its demultiplexers with highly sensitive signal
processing that eliminates the need for additional components to perform the same function. Multilinks demultiplexers are highly insensitive to jitter, allowing for longer optical transmission distances. Multilink is currently broadening its
portfolio of multiplexers and demultiplexers to include product offerings that are designed to incorporate greater functionality, higher levels of integration, smaller physical size, lower power consumption and tighter integration with its datalink
layer components. 

Multilinks physical layer products can
incorporate the following functions: 



Clock Multiplier Unit, or CMU, converts the clock at the input of the multiplexers into the higher speed clock needed at the output. Clocks synchronize the movement of data
throughout communications systems; 



Input Phase Locked Loop, or IPLL, synchronizes the transfer of data from Datalink devices into a multiplexer; 



Loss of Signal, or LOS, is an alarm that SONET/SDH systems need to analyze potential system faults; 



Clock and Data Recovery, or CDR, extracts data from the noisy signals received from optical systems; and 



Jitter filtering. 

Datalink Layer Products 

Multilink is currently investing in the development of numerous datalink layer products, including FEC devices and Framer/Mappers that integrate the
framing and mapping functions. In FEC, Multilink has invested heavily in algorithm, architecture and product development for both standards-based FEC and advanced FEC. FEC allows communications equipment manufacturers to increase the number of DWDM
optical channels in a fiber strand and/or to increase the length of the fiber transmission system. In addition, FEC devices can be designed to support new optical networking standards. 

Multilinks first FEC device, the MTC6130, is currently available, while a second FEC device, the MTC6131
SuperFEC
TM
 is shipping to customers. Future FEC products will address higher performance, higher levels of
integration, and/or higher bit rates. Multilink has announced the MTC6134 EFEC which greatly reduces the power while increasing the functionality of high-performance FEC. Framer/Mappers that are currently in development include advanced products for
10 Gb/s systems, as well as devices targeted for Gigabit Ethernet applications in the Metro market. Multilink has also announced the MTC 6210 framer/mapper for support of 10Gb/s systems utilizing Ethernet over SONET/SDN functionality. 

Customers 

In 2002, Multilink shipped its products to over 30 customers, including Alcatel, Ciena, Cisco, Lucent, Marconi, Nortel,
Siemens and TyCom. Multilink sold its integrated circuits, modules and higher-level assemblies to leading and emerging communications equipment manufacturers that develop high-speed optical transport networking systems. 

Lucent, Adva and Cisco accounted for approximately 36%, 9% and 8%,
respectively, of Multilinks revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2003. TyCom, Alcatel and Lucent accounted for approximately 25%, 19% and 10% of Multilinks revenues in 2002, respectively. During 2001, TyCom with 34% and Alcatel
with 29% accounted for more than 10% of Multilinks revenues and four other customers each accounted for 



greater than 5% of Multilinks revenues. Lucent, Alcatel, and Cisco accounted for approximately 34%, 28% and 11% of Multilinks revenues in 2000,
respectively. 

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

Sales 

Multilink targets leading and emerging communications equipment manufacturers that develop high-speed optical transport
networking systems. Multilink manages the sales process by interacting with its customers at multiple layers of its organization. Multilinks initial contact with a potential customer generally begins with either direct contact by its
management or sales force or through third-party manufacturers or independent sales representatives. Multilinks strategic account managers and marketing personnel manage the customer relationship throughout the pre-and post-sales
process. As needed, systems engineering personnel have detailed technical interactions with Multilinks customers during product definition. Multilinks application engineers assist the customer in designing the solution into the
customers systems. Close interaction further enables Multilink to establish strategic customer programs or relationships. 

Multilink sells its products through its direct sales force and through independent sales representatives working under the direction of Multilinks
strategic account managers. As of March 31, 2003, Multilinks direct sales force consisted of 18 direct sales professionals, application engineers, managers and administrative personnel located at Multilinks headquarters in Somerset, New
Jersey and other locations in the United States, and in Germany, Italy and China. 

Marketing 

Multilink
has traditionally marketed its products in North America and Europe and has recently begun to market its products in Asia. As of March 31, 2003, Multilinks marketing staff included 4 marketing professionals and administrative personnel.
Multilinks marketing activities include: 



product management and planning; 



seminar programs, trade shows, guest speaker invitations and technical conferences; 



public relations activities and customer events; 



advertising, technical articles in industry publications and marketing collateral materials; and 



communication on the Internet. 

Customer Service and Support 

Multilinks customer support activities are primarily managed by its applications engineering group consisting of both field applications engineers
and internal applications experts. This group supports customers during their design activities to facilitate Multilinks customers success, and can perform experiments to validate customers design ideas including insertion into
Multilinks fiber optic test facility. Multilinks philosophy is to provide comprehensive customer support to facilitate the design of its complex products into its customers systems. Multilinks applications engineering group
is also the initial point of contact for its customers should they experience any problems with a product after purchase. 

Manufacturing 

Multilink outsources the fabrication and assembly of its semiconductor devices, modules, high-level assemblies and transceivers. Multilink has in-house
semiconductor testing capabilities that allow it to develop and perform testing for low volume production. Multilink also has in-house final assembly and test for its high-level assemblies and transceivers. Multilink expects to continue its
outsource strategy and to continue to move its 



testing from its in-house capabilities to outside vendors. As a fabless semiconductor company, Multilink is able to concentrate its resources on supply chain
management design, development and marketing of its products. During October 2001, Multilink obtained its ISO 9001:2000 certification from the International Organization of Standardization. ISO 9001:2000 refers to an international set of quality
management system standards that organizations use worldwide. ISO 9001:2000 requires that Multilink plans and manages the process necessary for the continual improvement of its quality management system. 

Wafer Manufacturing 

Multilink outsources its semiconductor fabrication to several foundries for
high bit-rate technologies, including TSMC, TRW, IBM, TriQuint Semiconductor, and Conexant. The older generation of Multilinks mixed-signal products, which comprised a significant portion of Multilinks 2001 revenue, is based
predominantly on GaAs HBT wafers supplied by TRW. The wafers for the third and fourth generation of Multilinks mixed-signal products are based on SiGe technology supplied by IBM. Multilinks latest generations of products utilize wafers
using TSMCs 0.13 CMOS process technology. Multilinks manufacturing strategy is to qualify and utilize leading process technology for the fabrication of high bit-rate semiconductor devices and to utilize these external foundries
for a variety of different semiconductor technologies. There are certain risks associated with Multilinks dependence upon external foundries, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and costs,
the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand, limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to Multilink, increases in the prices and potential misappropriation of Multilinks intellectual property. Finding
alternative sources for these wafers will result in substantial delays in production and additional costs. 

Packaging, Assembly and Testing 

The primary vendors for the packaging, assembly and testing of Multilinks integrated circuit products are Kimball Electronics Group, ASAT Inc. and
Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. ASAT is currently building product for Multilink in its Hong Kong facility. The primary outsource vendor for the assembly and testing of Multilinks driver module products is Natel Engineering Co.,
Inc., and the majority of Multilinks surface mount technology assembly is being contracted from SMTEK International and Flextronics. 

Multilink operates in-house module manufacturing facilities that allow rapid prototyping and development of new products and also serve to complement its
outsource module manufacturing partners. Multilink has in-house module and integrated circuits testing facilities in California and New Jersey. Multilink maintains comprehensive review and inspection of its outsourcing facilities to ensure
compliance with its quality standards for manufacturing assembly and test. Multilinks manufacturing processes and outsource vendors utilize stringent quality controls, including incoming material inspection, in-process testing and final test,
and all are ISO 9001 certified. 

Research and Development 

As of March 31, 2003, Multilink had 98 employees dedicated to research and
development, of whom 50 hold advanced degrees, including 24 PhDs. Multilink has additional engineering employees dedicated to marketing, application engineering and business development. These employees are involved in advancing Multilinks
core technologies and applying these core technologies to product development and activities in Multilinks targeted markets. 

Multilink believes that the achievement of higher-levels of integration, functionality and performance and the introduction of new products in its target
markets is essential. As a result, Multilink has made and will continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Multilinks research and development expenses, exclusive of deferred stock compensation and warrant issuances,
for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $7.3 million, $46.1 million, $54.7 million and $24.6 million, respectively. 



Competition 

Multilink competes with component suppliers for optical networking systems. Multilink believes that the principal factors of competition for these markets
are: 



product time-to-market; 



product performance; 



product price; 



product quality; 



product reliability; 



success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies; 



market acceptance of competitors products; 



efficiency of production; 



expansion of production of Multilinks products for particular systems manufacturers; and 



customer support and reputation. 

Multilink competes with a number of major domestic and international suppliers. Multilink competes primarily against Agere, Applied Micro Circuits, Intel,
Infineon, JDS Uniphase, Maxim, MindSpeed (a Conexant company), Nortel (microelectronics division), NTT Electronics, Philips, PMC-Sierra and Vitesse. In addition to these established companies, Multilink also competes with various start-up entities.
In certain circumstances, most notably with respect to ASICs supplied to Lucent and Nortel, Multilinks customers or potential customers have internal integrated circuit and/or manufacturing capabilities. 

In addition, suppliers may begin to offer product solutions, including both
electronic and optical components. This creates the potential that suppliers of optical components, which are currently complementary to suppliers of electronic components, may become competitors as they broaden their product portfolio with
electronic components, or vice versa. Companies with existing capabilities or products in both areas may benefit from significant competitive advantages. 

Intellectual Property 

Multilink relies on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other
protective measures to protect its proprietary rights. Multilink also utilizes unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets and employ various methods to protect such intellectual property. To date, Multilink has one U.S. patent issued and 14
U.S. patent applications pending. 

Although Multilink employs a
variety of intellectual property in the development and manufacturing of its products, Multilink believes that none of such intellectual property is individually critical to its current operations. Taken as a whole, Multilink believes, however, that
its intellectual property rights are significant and that the loss of all or a substantial portion of such rights could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. There can be no assurance that Multilinks intellectual
property protection measures will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of its technology. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect Multilinks intellectual properties to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. From time to time, Multilink may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from others in order to further develop and market commercially viable products effectively. There can be no assurance that any necessary licenses will be
available on reasonable terms. 



Backlog 

Multilinks sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Quantities of Multilinks products to be
delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. For these reasons, Multilinks backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Accordingly,
Multilinks actual sales could be materially different than its recorded backlog. 

Environmental Matters 

Multilink is subject to
a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process. Any failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in the imposition of fines on Multilink, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. In addition, such regulations could restrict Multilinks ability to operate or expand any of its manufacturing
facilities or could require it to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2003, Multilink had a total of 157 employees, including 22 in sales, marketing and application engineering, 17 in manufacturing,
purchasing and quality, 98 in research and development and 20 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, approximately 130 were located in North America, 24 were located in Europe, 2 were located in Israel and one was located in
Asia. None of Multilinks employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor has Multilink experienced any work stoppages. 

Company 

Multilinks website address is 
www.mltc.com
. Multilink makes its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, available free of charge on Multilinks website as soon as reasonably practicable after it files these reports. 

Property 

Multilinks
corporate headquarters facility, consisting of approximately 36,000 square feet, is located in Somerset, New Jersey. Multilink leases its corporate headquarters facility pursuant to a sublease agreement that expires in April 2007 for approximately
12,000 square feet and pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in February 2006 for approximately 24,000 square feet. In June 2003, Multilink exercised its early termination option for the 12,000 square foot sublease and accordingly, such
sublease will now expire in April 2004. Multilink also leases its principal design facility, consisting of approximately 31,000 square feet, in Somerset, New Jersey, pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in October 2006. Pursuant to
Multilinks corporate realignment plan whereby it has consolidated facilities, Multilink has substantially vacated the Somerset, New Jersey design facility and is attempting to sublease the entire facility for the remaining lease term. In June
2003, Multilink entered into a termination agreement for 10,000 square feet in the design facility for less than $0.3 million in termination costs. Multilink continues to market the remaining 21,000 square feet. Multilink leases approximately 24,600
square feet of design space in Santa Monica, California pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in December 2005. Multilink entered into an early termination agreement for its approximate 7,000 square feet design center in Allentown, Pennsylvania
for less than $0.3 million. Multilink also leases approximately 1,800 square feet for a sales office in Los Altos, California pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in August 2003 that Multilink is also attempting to sublease. Multilink also
leases approximately 6,600 square feet for a design center in Santa Clara, California pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in May 2005. 



Multilink has terminated its Bochum, Germany lease for less than $0.1 million in termination costs and
now leases on a month-to-month basis. Multilink has also reduced its Munich lease square footage by approximately one-half from the original 19,400 square feet and revised the remaining lease term to expire in December 2003 for less than $0.1
million in termination costs. 

Multilink has a lease agreement
for an approximate 3,500 square feet facility in Kaunas, Lithuania, which expires in November 2004. Multilink entered into early termination agreements for its approximately 13,000 square feet facility in Israel and its approximate 2,200 square feet
facility in Milan, Italy.

Legal Proceedings 

In
February 2003, Multilink, its chief executive officer and its former chief financial officer were named as issuer defendants in a class action stockholder complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,
captioned Liu v. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, or CSFB, et al., Case No. 03-20459. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that CSFB knowingly conspired with dozens of issuers, including Multilink, to conduct initial public offerings based
on misinformation about the issuers future prospects and the proper pricing of their shares, in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages
and other relief. Neither Multilink nor the named individuals have yet been served with the complaint. Multilink believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously. 

In May 2003, Multilink was named as the defendant in a complaint filed by
Kimball Microelectronics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. In the complaint, plaintiff alleges that Multilink breached an Amended and Restated Supply Agreement between the parties. The plaintiffs allege
that such breach has resulted in damages in the amount of approximately $748,000. 



Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Multilinks financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Multilinks actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors including those set forth under Risk Factors herein. 

OVERVIEW 

Multilink designs, develops and
markets advanced integrated circuits, modules and higher-level assemblies that enable next generation optical networking systems. Multilink is expanding into the Access and Enterprise markets by leveraging its intellectual property portfolio of
mixed-signal, analog and digital signal processing technologies. During the past two years, Multilink has made significant research and development investments in developing mixed-signal products that utilize 0.13m CMOS technology. Multilink
recently announced products related to a new family of SerDes devices targeted at local area and storage area networks that can utilize Multilinks mixed-signal expertise. Multilink outsources substantially all of its semiconductor fabrication
and focuses its efforts on the design, development and marketing of its products. 

To date, Multilink has generated a substantial portion of its revenues from a limited number of customers. Multilinks top three customers for the three months ended March 31, 2003 were Lucent, ADVA and Cisco,
representing 36%, 9% and 8% of Multilinks revenues, respectively. Multilinks top three customers for the three months ended March 31, 2002 were TyCom, Alcatel and Lucent, representing 44%, 21% and 16% of Multilinks revenues,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Multilinks top three customers were TyCom, Alcatel and Lucent, representing 25%, 19% and 10% of Multilinks revenues, and three other customers each accounted for greater than 5% of
Multilinks revenues. 

A number of telecommunication
service providers have curtailed the level of their capital expenditures on their infrastructure build-out, which has significantly reduced the demand for Multilinks products by communications equipment manufacturers, including these principal
customers. Multilinks revenues continued to decline in the first quarter of 2003 compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. Due to general economic conditions and slowdowns in purchases of optical networking equipment, it has become
increasingly difficult for Multilink to predict the purchasing activities of its customers and Multilink expects that its operating results will fluctuate substantially in the future. 

During August 2002, Multilink commenced a significant corporate realignment plan that included workforce reductions, the
consolidation of facilities through closure of certain locations, a reduction in the level of activity at other locations and asset impairment charges. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, Multilink decided to make further headcount
reductions to reduce headcount to 60 employees by September 2003. Based upon Multilinks actual revenues being below managements expectations coupled with having very limited visibility to future revenues, Multilink concluded that these
reductions in headcount were necessary in order to reduce cash usage and to position Multilink for the future. Accordingly, during the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, Multilink will record additional severance and termination benefit charges of
approximately $1.5 million and asset impairment charges associated predominantly with purchased research and development software. Based upon headcount reductions associated with Multilinks realignment plan, attrition in the normal course of
business and headcount reductions as a result of Multilinks continuing efforts to reduce expenses across all functions, Multilinks headcount is expected to be approximately 60 employees by September 2003. The headcount reductions have
occurred at all of Multilinks locations in Europe, Israel and the United States. The headcount reduction portion of the initial plan was completed by April 2003. 

Multilink focuses its sales and marketing efforts on North American, European and Asian communications equipment
manufacturers. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, Multilink derived 67% of its total revenues from communications equipment manufacturers in North America compared with 86% during the comparable period in 2002. Multilink currently sells
through its direct sales force in North America, Europe and 



Asia and through selected independent sales representatives in the United States, France, Israel, China, Korea and Japan. International revenues are
denominated in U.S. dollars, which reduces Multilinks exposure to foreign currency risks. Multilink expects international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues. 

Revenues
.    Multilink recognizes product revenues
at the time of shipment. Multilinks customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase its products and can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice. Multilinks revenues substantially declined in 2002, compared
to 2001. In the ordinary course of business, Multilink receives order cancellations and rescheduled shipments. To the extent possible, Multilink pursues order cancellation fees from its customers. Depending upon the facts and circumstances
surrounding these cancellation fees, the receipt of such fees may have an immediate impact on revenues in the period that such fees are collected or the fees may need to be deferred and then recognized as revenue over some future period. Multilink
cannot ensure that it will be able to collect an order cancellation fee for each order cancelled and Multilink cannot project how such fees will affect revenue. 

Cost of Revenues
.    Cost of revenues consists of component and materials cost, direct labor, deferred stock compensation
relating to manufacturing labor, manufacturing, overhead costs and estimated warranty costs. Cost of revenues also includes adjustments to write down inventory to its net realizable value resulting from such items as customer order cancellations and
excess and obsolete inventory. Multilink outsources substantially all of the fabrication and assembly, and a portion of the testing, of its products. Accordingly, a significant portion of Multilinks cost of revenues consists of payments to its
third-party manufacturers. If revenues increase, Multilink believes favorable trends should occur in manufacturing costs due to its ability to absorb overhead costs over higher volumes. Nevertheless, there is a substantial fixed component to cost of
revenues, and the decline in Multilinks revenues in 2003, compared to 2002, has materially adversely affected its gross margins. 

Research and Development
.    Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs,
material, third-party costs and fees related to the development and prototyping of Multilinks products and depreciation associated with engineering and design software costs. Multilink expenses its research and development costs as they are
incurred, except for the purchase of engineering and design software licenses, which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life. Research and development is key to Multilinks future success and it will continue to
strategically invest in research and development in order to maximize its product offerings. Multilink expects that research and development expenses will decrease during 2003 in absolute dollar amounts due to the effects of its previously announced
corporate realignment plan. 

Sales and
Marketing
.    Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, customer service and application engineering support functions. As a result
of its corporate realignment plan, Multilink expects that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in 2003 in absolute dollar amounts as it executes on its corporate realignment plan. 

General and Administrative
.    General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries
and related expenses for executive, finance, accounting, facilities, information services, human resources, recruiting, professional fees and other corporate expenses. Multilink expects that general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2003
in absolute dollar amounts due to the effects of its corporate realignment plan and various cost reduction programs that were initiated in 2001 with the purpose of maximizing the leverage within general and administrative functions. 

Deferred Stock Compensation
.    In connection with
stock option and restricted stock grants to its employees, officers and directors, Multilink recorded deferred stock compensation. Deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the grant price and the fair value of the common stock
underlying options and restricted stock granted during these periods. Deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity. Multilink is amortizing its deferred stock compensation using the graded vesting method, in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, over the vesting period of each respective option, generally three to 



four years. Based on Multilinks balance of deferred stock compensation as of March 31, 2003, Multilink estimates its amortization of deferred stock
compensation for each of the periods below to be as follows: 

Year Ending December 31,

Amount

(in thousands)

2003 (subsequent to March 31, 2003)

$

Total

$

1,276

Approximately $0.2
million of the remaining amortization of deferred stock compensation will be charged to cost of revenues. Subsequent to its initial public offering, Multilink did not issue any stock options that required the recognition of any deferred stock
compensation. 

Net Income
(Loss)
.    In addition to the items discussed above, net income (loss) also includes interest expense, other income, income or loss associated with Multilinks equity investments and a provision or benefit for income
taxes. Interest expense relates to interest associated with capital leases and equipment and software financings. Other income represents investment earnings on Multilinks cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 

Revenues.
    Revenues decreased to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $10.1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2002. The decrease was due to a continuing dramatic decline in demand for products in Multilinks sector generally, resulting in reduced component purchases by communications equipment manufacturers. 

Gross Profit
.    Cost of revenues, including
less than $0.1 million of deferred stock compensation, decreased to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues, or gross
margin, decreased to a negative 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with a positive 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2002. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, it accrued $0.2 million for the portion of a minimum
purchase contract that Multilink believes is in excess of its requirements. Multilinks lower sales volume and the accrual for this purchase contract were the most significant factors contributing to the gross margin reduction. Gross margin for
the three months ended March 31, 2002 is favorably impacted by the sale of inventory, with a cost of $0.5 million, that was previously written down to its net realizable value during the first quarter of 2001. Gross margins were increased to 40%
from 37% from the sale of this previously written down inventory. The inventory was written down during the first quarter of 2001 based upon information from the sole customer of the product that they were moving from GaAs to SiGe technology. The
customers transition from GaAs to SiGe was delayed. Multilink does not expect any material orders for this product during 2003; however, it will continue to disclose the effect of such sales on gross margin. 

Research and Development
.    Research and
development expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, decreased to $7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. As a percentage of revenues, research and
development expenses increased to 765% for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with 127% for the three months March 31, 2002. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to the reduction in revenues discussed above. The decrease in
absolute dollars is the result of Multilinks focused spending on projects that it believes will be accretive to revenues in the near term, Multilinks company-wide expense reduction programs and its corporate realignment program. Despite
the reduction in communications equipment manufacturer spending, Multilink will continue to strategically invest in research and development and seek to build relationships with a global customer base of 



communications equipment manufacturers. Multilink is targeting investments in research and development on expanding its addressable markets to include
Metro/Access and Enterprise applications. Multilinks research and development spending will be reduced if forecasted 2003 revenues do not meet its expectations. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2003, stock based compensation expense associated with research and development
decreased to $0.5 million as compared with $1.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2002. The decrease is due to headcount reductions as a result of Multilinks corporate realignment plan and the acceleration of stock based
compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2002 in connection with Multilinks stock option exchange program. As a result of Multilinks stock option exchange program, there is less deferred stock compensation that
remains to be amortized into the consolidated statement of operations. 

Sales and Marketing
.    Sales and marketing expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, decreased to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $3.9 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2002. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased to 192% for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The increase as a percentage of revenues is due
primarily to the reduced revenues discussed above. The decrease in absolute dollars is the result of Multilinks company-wide expense reduction programs and its corporate realignment program. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense
associated with sales and marketing expenses during 2003 compared with 2002 is due to the same reasons discussed above under research and development. 

General and Administrative
.    General and administrative expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, decreased to $1.7
million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 176% for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared
with 24% for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The decrease in absolute dollars was due primarily to Multilinks focused efforts to leverage its general and administrative expenses by reducing spending and the execution of its corporate
realignment plan. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense associated with general and administrative expenses during 2003 compared with 2002 is due to the same reasons discussed above under research and development.

Deferred Stock Compensation
.    Operating expenses
included amortization of deferred stock compensation of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The decrease is due to (i) a greater proportion of deferred stock
compensation expense being recognized earlier in the vesting period, (ii) the cancellation of options due to employee terminations in connection with Multilinks realignment plan and (iii) the reduction in deferred stock compensation as a
result of accelerating the amortization of expense during the three months ended September 30, 2002 relating to options that were tendered in connection with Multilinks stock option exchange program. Since its initial public offering in June
2001, Multilink has not issued any stock options with an exercise price below fair value that would require the recognition of any deferred stock compensation. Multilink has issued restricted stock to certain of its employees. The deferred stock
compensation associated with these restricted stock grants is being amortized over the vesting period, which generally ranges from six months to three years. The deferred stock compensation associated with the restricted stock grants will increase
deferred stock compensation expense in future quarters. 

In
June 2002 Multilink initiated a voluntary stock option exchange program to its employees, officers and board members located in the United States and Europe. The program commenced on June 24, 2002, and as amended in July 2002, participants were able
to tender for cancellation stock options to purchase Multilink Class A common stock that have an exercise price equal to or greater than $13.50 per share (calculated after giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split) for replacement options
to purchase Class A common stock to be granted on a date which is at least six months plus one day from the date of cancellation of the tendered options. The cancellation date was August 30, 2002. On March 3, 2003, 718,530 replacement options were
granted with an exercise price of $1.98, which was equal to the market price of Multilink Class A common stock on such date. The remaining terms and conditions of the replacement options, including the vesting schedules, are substantially the same
as the terms and conditions of the options cancelled. 



Investment Impairments and Related Charges
.    During the three months ended
March 31, 2003, Multilink recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million associated with its investment in Innovative Processing AG (IPAG). Multilink believes that the reduction in the value of its investment in IPAG is other than
temporary. IPAG is an optical component start-up company and is subject to many of the same industry risks as Multilink. 

In determining whether its investment in IPAG was impaired, Multilink considered several factors such as, but not limited to, the reduction in market
valuations for optical component companies, the continued reduction in spending by communications equipment manufacturers, the historical and forecasted operating results of IPAG and changes in technology. Upon review of these and other qualitative
and quantitative factors, Multilink concluded that its investment in IPAG was impaired. 

Corporate Realignment
.    During the three months ended March 31, 2003, Multilink decided to accelerate the closure of one of its facilities. When Multilink originally recorded the
realignment charge for this closure during the three months ended December 31, 2002, Multilink had planned on closing this facility sometime during the middle of 2003. As a result of its decision to accelerate the closure date to March 30, 2003,
Multilink recorded severance and lease expenses of $0.2 million in excess of its original estimates. 

Based upon headcount reductions associated with Multilinks realignment plan, attrition in the normal course of business and expected headcount
reductions as a result of its continuing efforts to reduce expenses across all functions, Multilink anticipates that its worldwide headcount will decrease to less than 100 people by June 30, 2003. The headcount reductions will occur at all of
Multilinks locations in Europe, Israel and the United States. Generally, as attrition occurs, Multilink is allocating current resources to fill the vacancies. Multilink has estimated that the total cash cost of the realignment plan is
approximately $4.9 million and that the plan, combined with its other cost saving initiatives, will contribute approximately $35.0 million of annual cash savings. The estimated remaining cash outflows related to the plan are expected to be $1.6
million for the remainder of 2003, less than $0.6 million in 2004 and $0.7 million thereafter. The estimated cash outflow and annual cash savings related to the plan will, however, be negatively impacted if it takes Multilink longer than anticipated
to sublease some of its closed facilities or if its planned terminations are delayed. 

Other Income and Expenses, Net
.    Other income decreased to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The
decrease is due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from software and equipment financings during 2001 and the first half of 2002 and lower interest income as a result of having a lower average cash and short-term investment balance.
Multilink expects that other income will continue to decrease as its cash and short-term investments decrease during 2003, offset by a decrease in interest expense related to software and equipment financing. 

Net Income (Loss)
.    Net loss increased to $12.2
million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared with $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The increase in net loss is predominantly due to the items discussed above including the reduction in revenue and the
corresponding decrease in gross profit, discontinuing the recognition of a deferred tax benefit offset by Multilinks reduced spending in all areas. During the three months ended March 31, 2002, Multilink recognized a tax benefit of $6.4
million. During the three months ended June 30, 2002, Multilink concluded that significant uncertainty existed surrounding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. 

On a quarterly basis, Multilink assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets by reviewing a number of factors,
including operating trends, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future projections of taxable income, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required to reduce such deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than
not to be realized. Multilink considered the following factors in assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets: (i) further announced reductions in 2002 capital spending by the major telecommunication service providers and industry
analysts forecasting a further reduction in capital spending in 2003, (ii) significant workforce reductions within the telecommunications and related industries, (iii) continued poor visibility of customer orders, (iv) a depressed capital market
which makes obtaining new capital difficult and (v) a lower than expected demand for 10 gigabit products. 



Based on the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are
realizable, Multilink believes that significant uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, Multilink continues to record a valuation allowance equal to its deferred tax assets. 

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 

Revenues.
    Revenues decreased to $18.3 million
in 2002, compared with $130.5 million in 2001. The decrease was due to a continuing dramatic decline in demand for products in Multilinks sector generally, resulting in reduced component purchases by communications equipment manufacturers.

Gross Profit.
    Cost of revenues
decreased to $18.5 million in 2002, compared with $59.4 million in 2001. During 2002, cost of revenues included $1.6 million of deferred stock compensation. Gross margin decreased to negative 1% in 2002 compared with 54% in 2001. The significant
reduction in gross margin during 2002 is partially a result of the significant charges, offset by certain credits, recorded against cost of revenues during 2002. The significant items that affected gross margin during 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

Excluding the impact
of the above-mentioned items, gross margins would have been 34% and 63% during 2002 and 2001, respectively. As discussed above, the decrease in gross margin is due to the decrease in sales volume as a result of reduced spending by communications
equipment manufacturers. 

Inclusive of the above-mentioned
items, the decrease in gross margin was due predominantly to $5.7 million of inventory charges to reduce inventories to their net realizable value and to write off an advance made to a supplier. Included in the $5.7 million is a $4.8 million
inventory write-down. The inventory was written down to its net realizable value based upon Multilinks determination that excess quantities of certain modules and raw materials existed. The excess quantities of the modules are the result of
forecasted demand not developing as expected and the introduction of two new modules. The new modules have enhanced performance and cost less to produce thereby rendering the prior modules obsolete. Accordingly, after allowing for forecasted demand
and warranty issues, Multilink wrote down this product to its net realizable value. Certain raw materials were also written down based upon the reduction in forecasted demand for the finished goods that these raw materials were used to manufacture.
The remaining raw materials in excess of required demand have no alternative uses and therefore will be disposed. 

As part of its corporate realignment plan, Multilink discontinued manufacturing transponders. As a result of this decision, Multilink wrote down $0.4
million of transponder raw material inventory to its net realizable value. Multilink has no alternative uses for these raw materials. Also included in this inventory charge is $0.5 million that represents an advance made to a finished goods supplier
in 2000. Multilink agreed to reduce amounts owing under the advance by receiving a discount on purchases it made from the supplier. Multilinks agreement stated 



that if it did not make sufficient purchases to utilize the entire advance through such discounts, it would not require the supplier to repay the remaining
balance. Based upon its review of forecasted demand for the products that this supplier manufactures, Multilink believes that it is unlikely that it will utilize the remaining advance. 

In conjunction with the lower forecasted demand discussed above, Multilink performed an impairment analysis of its
manufacturing assets. Based upon review of future undiscounted cash flows, which indicated impairment, Multilink recorded a $1.1 million impairment charge to write down these assets, which are all equipment, to their fair value. Fair value was
predominantly determined based upon used equipment prices quoted by independent third parties. 

The foregoing charges were offset by the reversal of $1.0 million of certain accruals and the sale of inventory, with a cost of $0.7 million that was previously written down to its net realizable value during the
first quarter of 2001. The $1.0 million of accrual reversals pertains to accruals that existed at December 31, 2001. During 2002, when final information used to determine the adequacy of these accruals was obtained, the accruals were adjusted
accordingly. The sale of previously written down inventory relates to inventory that was written down during the first quarter of 2001 based upon information from the sole customer that it was moving from GaAs to SiGe technology. The customers
transition from GaAs to SiGe has been delayed resulting in immaterial purchases of this inventory by the customer. Multilink does not expect any material orders for this product during 2003; however, it will continue to disclose the effect of such
sales on gross margin. 

During 2002, stock-based compensation
expense associated with cost of revenues decreased $0.5 million compared to 2001. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense in 2002 compared with the comparable period in 2001 is due predominantly to headcount reductions and the reduction in
the rate of amortization of deferred stock-based compensation as a result of being further into vesting periods. As the vesting period progresses, the amount of deferred stock-based compensation amortized into expense decreases. As discussed below,
stock-based compensation includes additional charges of $0.3 million relating to stock-based compensation that was accelerated into the statement of operations as a result of Multilinks stock option exchange program that concluded on August
30, 2002. 

Included in the $8.8 million inventory charge during
2001 is a $4.3 million inventory write-down required as a result of a migration by certain of Multilinks customers from GaAs-based products to comparable SiGe-based products. Also included in this inventory charge is $3.4 million relating to
order cancellations as a result of decreased carrier spending, $0.6 million that relates to inventory shrink and lower than expected production yields of consigned inventories located at Multilinks finished goods suppliers and $0.5 million of
raw materials used in a previous generation of Multilinks transponder that is no longer being utilized in the newer, more advanced version of its transponder. 

Research and Development.
    Research and development expenses, excluding deferred stock
compensation, decreased to $46.1 million in 2002, compared with $54.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased to 253% in 2002, compared with 42% in 2001. The increase in research and development
expenses as a percent of revenues was due to the significant reduction in Multilinks revenues during this period. The decrease in absolute dollars is the result of Multilinks focused spending on projects that it believes will be
accretive to revenues in the near term, Multilinks company-wide expense reduction programs and its corporate realignment program. The decrease in absolute dollars is partially due to the reversal of an accrual of $1.2 million during 2002.
Additional data was obtained which provided Multilink with enough information to adjust these accruals downward. Despite the reduction in communications equipment manufacturer spending, Multilink will continue to strategically invest in research and
development and seek to build relationships with a global customer base of communications equipment manufacturers. Multilink is targeting investments in research and development on expanding its addressable markets to include Metro/Access and
Enterprise applications. Multilinks research and development spending will be adversely impacted if forecasted 2003 revenues do not meet its expectations. 



During 2002, stock-based compensation expense associated with research and development increased $1.5 as
compared to 2001. The increase was due to restricted stock grants to engineering personnel and the acceleration of $1.3 million of additional expense. The additional stock compensation expense relates to deferred stock-based compensation that was
accelerated into the statement of operations as a result of Multilinks stock option exchange program that concluded on August 30, 2002. 

Sales and Marketing.
    Sales and marketing expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, decreased to $12.4 million in
2002, compared with $17.4 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased to 68% during 2002, compared with 13% during 2001. The decrease in absolute dollars was due primarily to Multilinks concentrated
effort to reduce expenses as it began to execute on its corporate realignment plan. The increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduced revenues discussed above. 

In conjunction with its stock option exchange program, Multilink accelerated
$0.5 million of stock-based compensation into the statement of operations relating to option grants to sales and marketing personnel that were tendered as part of the option exchange. After adjusting for the accelerated expense associated with
Multilinks stock option exchange program, the decrease in stock-based compensation expense associated with sales and marketing expenses during 2002 compared with 2001 is due predominantly to the reduction in the rate of amortization of
deferred stock-based compensation as a result of being further into vesting periods and headcount reductions. As the vesting period progresses, the amount of deferred stock-based compensation amortized into expense decreases.

General and Administrative.
    General and
administrative expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, decreased to $7.7 million in 2002, compared with $11.8 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 42% in 2002, compared with 9% in 2001. The
decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to Multilinks focused efforts to leverage its general and administrative expenses by reducing spending and the execution of its corporate realignment plan. The increase in general and
administrative expense as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduced revenues discussed above. 

In conjunction with its stock option exchange program, Multilink accelerated $0.5 million of stock-based compensation into the statement of operations
relating to option grants to general and administrative personnel that were tendered as part of the option exchange. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense associated with general and administrative expenses during 2002 compared with 2001
is due to the same reasons discussed above under sales and marketing.

Deferred Stock Compensation.
    Operating expenses included amortization of deferred stock compensation of $11.2 million in 2002, compared with $9.9 million in 2001. As discussed below, the
increase is due predominantly to Multilinks stock option exchange program. 

As previously disclosed herein, in June 2002 Multilink initiated a voluntary stock option exchange program to its employees, officers and board members located in the United States and Europe. The program commenced on
June 24, 2002, and as amended in July 2002, participants were able to tender for cancellation stock options to purchase Multilink Class A common stock that have an exercise price equal to or greater than $13.50 per share (calculated after giving
effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split) for replacement options to purchase Class A common stock to be granted on a date which is at least six months plus one day from the date of cancellation of the tendered options. The cancellation date
was August 30, 2002. On March 3, 2003, replacement options to purchase a total of 718,530 shares of Multilink Class A common stock were granted with an exercise price of $1.98, which was equal to the market price of Multilink Class A common stock on
such date. The remaining terms and conditions of the replacement options, including the vesting schedules, are substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the options cancelled. During 2002, $2.6 million of deferred stock compensation
associated with the stock options that were tendered in connection with this offer was accelerated into Multilinks statement of operations. 



Deferred stock compensation associated with stock options decreased offset by deferred stock compensation
associated with restricted stock grants since 2001. The decrease in the deferred stock compensation associated with stock options is due to a greater proportion of deferred stock compensation expense being recognized earlier in the vesting period
and the cancellation of options due to employee terminations. Under the graded vesting method of amortization, a greater proportion of deferred stock compensation is recorded in the earlier years of the vesting period. Since the most significant
portion of deferred stock-based compensation was recorded on option grants in 2000 and early 2001, much of the deferred stock-based compensation associated with these grants has already been amortized as expense. Since its initial public offering in
June 2001, Multilink has not issued any stock options with an exercise price below fair value that would require the recognition of any deferred stock compensation. Multilink has, however, issued restricted stock to certain of its employees. The
deferred stock compensation associated with these restricted stock grants is being amortized over the vesting period, which generally ranges from six months to three years. The deferred stock compensation associated with the restricted stock grants
will increase deferred stock compensation expense in future quarters. 

Investment Impairments and Related Charges
.    During 2002, Multilink recorded impairment and related charges associated with its investments in ASIP and IMC. ASIP is a privately held, optical device start-up
company that is subject to many of the same risks as Multilink. Multilink accounts for its investment in ASIP under the equity method of accounting. During 2002, Multilink recorded a $3.5 million charge associated with its relationship with ASIP.
This charge consists of (i) an impairment charge on the remaining net investment balance of $0.4 million, (ii) a $0.7 million write off of goodwill associated with the ASIP investment and (iii) a $2.4 million asset impairment charge on equipment
that was consigned to ASIP in accordance with an existing development and license agreement that expires in May 2003. 

In determining whether its investment in ASIP and related goodwill was impaired, Multilink considered several factors such as, but not limited to, the
reduction in market valuations for optical device companies, the continued reduction in spending by communications equipment manufacturers, the historical and forecasted operating results of ASIP and changes in technology. Upon review of these and
other qualitative and quantitative factors, Multilink concluded that its remaining net investment in ASIP and corresponding goodwill was impaired. Multilink also performed a recoverability analysis of the consigned equipment at ASIP. Multilink has
no alternative uses for this equipment and cannot project any future cash flows from such equipment. Accordingly, Multilink recorded an asset impairment charge to write down the consigned equipment to fair value. 

Multilink has also provided a guarantee for a facility lease of ASIP. The
guarantee is through December 31, 2005, provided that ASIP continues to meet all terms and conditions of the lease. Assuming that ASIP is current on their lease payments, the total remaining lease payments to be made by ASIP during the guarantee
period are $1.0 million. Because the likelihood that Multilink would have to satisfy this guarantee is not probable, no liability has been recorded for the guarantee. In addition, Multilink is obligated to incur an additional $1.0 million of
development expenses and to expend an additional $0.8 million for capital in accordance with the development and license agreement. 

Also during 2002, Multilink recognized an other than temporary reduction in the value of its investment in IMC. Multilink reduced the carrying value of
its investment in IMC by $1.4 million from an original cost basis of $1.6 million. IMC is an optical device company and is subject to many of the same industry risks as Multilink. Multilink concluded that a write down was required as a result of
market valuation reductions in Multilinks and IMCs industries, coupled with new financial projections received from IMC. 

Corporate Realignment
.    During 2002, Multilink recorded an $11.0 million charge in connection with the corporate realignment
plan that it announced in August 2002. Multilink commenced this plan to create a more efficient cost structure and realign its business to reflect the current telecommunication market environment, which will permit Multilink to focus its employees
on its key business strategies. The major initiatives of the plan include a reduction of 40 to 45 percent in Multilinks worldwide headcount, the consolidation of facilities through the closure of certain locations and the reduction in the
level of activity at other locations. The headcount 



reduction portion of the plan was substantially completed by December 2002 and is expected to be fully completed by September 2003. During the three months
ended September 30, 2002, Multilink recorded $12.3 million of this charge. The charge includes (i) $1.9 million for workforce reductions that represents predominantly severance costs, (ii) $3.9 million predominantly representing lease termination
costs relating to the consolidation of facilities through closure of certain locations and/or a reduction in the level of activity at other locations and (iii) asset impairment charges of $6.5 million. As a result of the employee terminations
associated with the realignment plan, a portion of Multilinks purchased research and development software, equipment and leasehold improvements will not be fully utilized. The asset write down charge of $6.5 million was determined upon the
review of the future undiscounted cash flows related primarily to purchased research and development software, equipment and leasehold improvements. Multilink concluded that an impairment charge was necessary to write down these assets to their fair
value. 

During the three months ended December 31, 2002,
Multilink expanded the plan by deciding to close additional facilities in addition to those already included in the charge recorded during the third quarter of 2002. During the three months ended December 31, 2002, Multilink recorded a net credit of
$1.3 million to the realignment charge. This net credit represents (i) asset impairment charges of $0.6 million relating predominantly to research and development equipment as determined upon the review of the future undiscounted cash flows related
to such assets, (ii) $0.3 million of lease costs resulting from the decision to close or consolidate additional facilities, (iii) a credit of $1.4 million resulting from favorable contract termination costs and (iv) a $0.8 million credit as a result
of a favorable settlement for certain software licenses that were financed with the vendor. Multilink recognized the $1.4 million from favorable contract termination costs because it successfully negotiated a reduction in certain liabilities
recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2002 relating to three operating facility leases and one purchase contract. When these liabilities were originally recorded, Multilink recorded a liability for the expected cost of terminating
these contracts. In regard to operating leases for facilities, Multilink recorded a liability for the remaining lease term less estimated sublease income and for the purchase contract, Multilink recorded a liability for the quantity of test boards
that it believed would not be purchased. Multilink expects to purchase less test boards as a result of the headcount reductions and the rationalization of its research and development resources to different projects in accordance with its
realignment plan. Multilink successfully negotiated favorable termination settlements for the three facility operating leases and the purchase commitment contract. Multilink settled these liabilities for $1.4 million less than originally estimated.
The $0.8 million is the result of favorable negotiations with a software vendor relating to financed software licenses. Multilink successfully negotiated a reduction in the remaining financed obligation and recorded such amount as a credit to the
asset write down charge. 

Upon completion of the plan,
Multilink anticipates that its worldwide headcount will decrease to approximately 150 people as compared to 382 at December 31, 2001. The headcount reductions will occur at all of Multilinks locations in Europe, Israel and the United States.
This reduction in headcount is due to both terminations in accordance with Multilinks realignment plan and attrition in the normal course of business. Generally, as attrition occurs, Multilink is allocating current resources to fill the
vacancies. After adjusting for the favorable contract terminations discussed above, Multilink has estimated that the total cash cost of the realignment plan is approximately $4.7 million and that the plan, combined with its other cost saving
initiatives, will contribute approximately $35.0 million of annual cash savings. The estimated remaining cash outflows related to the plan are expected to be $2.2 million in 2003, less than $0.6 million in 2004 and $0.7 million thereafter. The
estimated cash outflow and annual cash savings related to the plan will, however, be negatively impacted if it takes Multilink longer than anticipated to sublease some of its closed facilities or if Multilinks planned terminations are delayed.

Other Income and Expenses,
Net.
    Other income decreased to $0.4 million in 2002, compared with $1.0 million in 2001. The decrease is due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from software and equipment financings during 2001 and the first
half of 2002 and lower interest income as a result of having a lower average cash and short term investment balance during 2002, as compared to 2001 which included proceeds of Multilinks June 2001 initial public offering. Multilink expects
that other income will continue to decrease as its cash and short term investments decrease during 2003, offset by a decrease in interest expense related to software and equipment financing. 



Net Income (Loss).
    Net loss was $106.2 million in 2002, compared with $12.4
million in 2001. The increase in net loss is predominantly due to the items discussed above including the reduction in revenue and the corresponding decrease in gross profit, corporate realignment expenses, the inventory write downs and related
charges, investment impairments and related charges and the fixed asset impairment charge. In addition to the items discussed above, the net loss is also increased by Multilinks recognition of a valuation allowance against all of its deferred
tax assets. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2002,
Multilink concluded that significant uncertainty existed surrounding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. On a quarterly basis, Multilink assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets by reviewing a number of factors, including
operating trends, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future projections of taxable income, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required to reduce such deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. Multilink considered the following factors that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2002 in assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets: (i) further announced reductions in 2002 capital spending by the major
telecommunication service providers and industry analysts forecasting a further reduction in capital spending in 2003, (ii) significant workforce reductions within the telecommunications and related industries, (iii) continued poor visibility of
customer orders, (iv) a depressed capital market which makes obtaining new capital difficult and (v) a lower than expected demand for 10 gigabit products. 

Based on the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are realizable, Multilink believes that significant
uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, during 2002, Multilink recorded a valuation allowance equal to its deferred tax assets. As a result of recording the valuation allowance, $12.2 million was
charged against additional paid-in capital. The $12.2 million charge represents deferred tax assets that were recorded as a result of employee stock option and warrant exercises. The $12.2 million benefit was originally recorded as a credit to
additional paid-in capital and not as a credit to the income tax benefit. 

Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 

Revenues.
    Revenues increased to $130.5 million in 2001, compared with $72.7 million in 2000. The increase was due to higher unit volume shipments of integrated circuits, modules and higher-level assemblies to
existing and new customers and the introduction of new products. Sales of modules and higher-level assemblies accounted for approximately 60% of revenues in 2001. 

Gross Profit.    
Cost of revenues, including $2.1 million of deferred stock compensation,
increased to $59.4 million in 2001, compared with $27.9 million in 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues, or gross margin, decreased to 54% in 2001 compared with 62% in 2000. The decrease in gross margin was due predominantly to (i)
increased deferred stock compensation of $1.2 million due to stock option grants to manufacturing employees coupled with increased manufacturing headcount and (ii) $8.8 million of charges to reduce inventories to their net realizable value and to
record order cancellation charges due to Multilinks vendors. Included in the $8.8 million is a $4.3 million inventory write-down required as a result of a migration by certain of Multilinks customers from GaAs-based products to
SiGe-based comparable products. This has resulted in cancellation of orders by certain customers, the most significant of which was by Alcatels submarine networks division, which has moved to a new design system more rapidly than expected, and
certain other customers indicating that they will be utilizing SiGe products instead of GaAs products in the future. This inventory charge also includes a $3.4 million inventory write-down required as a result of order cancellations as a result of
decreased spending by telecommunication service providers. Also included in this inventory charge is $0.6 million that relates to consigned inventories located at Multilinks finished goods suppliers. The charge is the result of inventory
shrink and lower than expected production yields during the three months ended March 31, 2001 at these finished goods suppliers. Multilink performed procedures to ensure that the entire charge is associated with the first quarter of 2001 including
conducting a physical count of the consigned inventory during the fourth quarter of 2000. Multilink identified this inventory shortage as its suppliers utilized consigned raw materials for the production of Multilinks products. As the
consigned raw material inventory balance was reduced, Multilink realized that a 



discrepancy existed between its perpetual records and the actual physical quantity on hand at its suppliers locations. Multilink will no longer consign
inventory to these suppliers as Multilink is allowing these suppliers to purchase their own raw materials to manufacture Multilinks finished good products. This will improve cash flows by maintaining lower raw material inventory levels. The
remaining inventory charge of $0.5 million represents raw materials used in a previous generation of Multilinks transponder that is no longer being utilized in the newer, more advanced version of Multilinks transponder. 

Excluding the impact of the $8.8 million inventory charge and of deferred
stock compensation, gross margins would have been 63% in 2001 and 2000. 

Research and Development.
    Research and development expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, increased to $54.7 million in 2001 compared with $24.6 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, research
and development expenses increased to 42% in 2001 compared with 34% in 2000. The increase in both dollars and as a percent of revenues was due primarily to the addition of engineering personnel in the United States and three new research and
development centers located within Europe and Israel as Multilink continues the development of new products to support revenue growth, costs associated with a joint development agreement that Multilink entered into during May 2000 and depreciation
and amortization on research and development equipment and software purchased during late 2000 and early 2001. A significant portion of the 2001 research and development spending was on complex VLSI devices that perform critical edge framing and
client aggregation functions and for high speed CMOS to drive integration of these functions across the entire line card. 

Stock-based compensation expense associated with research and development increased $2.5 million due to stock option grants to engineering personnel
coupled with increased headcount. 

Sales and
Marketing.
    Sales and marketing expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, increased to $17.4 million in 2001 compared with $7.1 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased to
13% in 2001 compared with 10% in 2000. The increase in both dollars and as a percent of revenues was due primarily to the addition of sales and marketing and application engineering personnel as Multilink has begun to expand its internal domestic
and international sales force. Stock-based compensation expense associated with sales and marketing increased $1.5 million due to stock option grants to sales and marketing personnel coupled with increased headcount. 

General and Administrative.
    General and
administrative expenses, excluding deferred stock compensation, increased to $11.8 million in 2001 compared with $7.6 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative were 9% in 2001 compared with 10% in 2000. The increase in
dollars was due primarily to the addition of personnel in the latter half of 2000 and the associated payroll and related costs within the areas of senior management, finance and human resources. The decrease as a percentage of revenues is due to
getting better leverage of such costs in 2001. There was no material change in stock-based compensation expense associated with general and administrative expenses.

Deferred Stock Compensation.
    Operating expenses included amortization of deferred stock
compensation of $9.9 in 2001 compared with $6.1 in 2000 due to a greater number of option grants to new and existing employees and a full year of amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with 2000 option grants. 

Other Income and Expenses, Net
.    Other income
decreased to $1.0 million in 2001 compared with other income of $1.6 in 2000. The decrease was due primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from software and equipment financings during 2001 and $0.7 million of losses from Multilinks
investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

Net Income (Loss).
    Net loss increased to $12.4 million in 2001 compared with $3.7 million in 2000. The increase in net loss is predominantly due to the items discussed above including the inventory write-off,
increased spending in the areas of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative 



and an increase in deferred stock compensation expense offset by an income tax benefit. The tax benefit was predominantly created as a result of
Multilinks determination that the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was no longer necessary coupled with the current year net loss.

During April 2001, Multilink guaranteed a facility lease for ASIP. The guarantee is through December 31, 2005 provided that ASIP continues to meet all terms and conditions of the
lease. The total remaining lease payments to be made by ASIP during the guarantee period are $0.9 million. Because the likelihood that Multilink will have to satisfy this guarantee is not probable, no liability has been recorded for the guarantee
and Multilink cannot project when or if it will have to satisfy such guarantee. 

As of March 31, 2003, Multilink had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $36.2 million. As of December 31, 2002, Multilink had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $47.6 million.

Cash used in operating activities was $10.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2003 compared with cash provided by operations
of $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2002. Net loss of $12.2 million includes non-cash charges of $2.1 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.7 million for amortization of deferred stock compensation, $0.3 million of
investment impairments and $0.2 million for the additional corporate realignment charge discussed above. Cash used in operating activities was $33.7 million during 2002 compared with cash provided by operations of $5.9 million during 2001. Net loss
of $106.2 million includes $11.0 million of corporate realignment charges and non-cash charges of $11 7 million for depreciation and amortization, $12.7 million for amortization of deferred stock compensation, $1.1 million of asset impairment
charges that are not included in the corporate realignment charge, $5.7 million of inventory write down and related charges, $4.9 million of investment impairments and related charges and deferred tax expense of $14.5 million. The increase in cash
used in operating activities is due to the significant reduction in revenues discussed above. The increase in cash used in operating activities is due to the significant reduction in revenues discussed above. 

Cash provided by investing activities was $9.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2003 compared with $11.9 million of cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2002. The increase in cash provided by investing activities is due to the net sale of $9.0 million of marketable securities
during the first quarter of 2003 as compared with a net purchase of $10.8 million of marketable securities during the first quarter of 2002, coupled with a decrease in fixed asset purchases and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets. Cash provided
by investing activities increased to $21.6 million for 2002 from $62.4 million of cash used in investing activities for 2001. The increase is due to the net sale of $27.9 million of marketable securities during 2002 as compared with a net purchase
of $42.8 million of marketable securities during 2001, coupled with a decrease in fixed asset purchases. In addition, during 2001, Multilink made $2.0 million of investments in non-marketable securities (ASIP and IPAG). The proceeds from the sale of
marketable securities were used predominantly for operating purposes and to pay certain financing obligations that were due. 



Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003 compared
with $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2002. The increase in cash used by financing activities is due to a decrease in stock option exercises during the first quarter of 2003, an increase in Multilinks debt payments due to
software and equipment financings that were entered into during the first half of 2002, and a decrease in the restricted cash balance required as a result of the terms of Multilinks credit facility discussed below. Cash used in financing
activities was $5.1 million for 2002 compared with $77.1 million of cash provided by financing activities for 2001. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is predominantly due to the proceeds from Multilinks initial public
offering in June 2001. During 2002, Multilinks debt payments increased due to software and equipment financings that it entered into during the latter part of 2001 and during the first half of 2002. In addition, Multilink made a $0.5 million
loan to its Co-Chairman and Executive Vice President. The loan was made to assist the officer with the purchase of a new home upon his transfer from Multilinks European headquarters in Germany to its California facility. In October 2002,
Multilink entered into a separation agreement with this officer, which was amended in December 2002, requiring a $125,000 separation payment, the vesting of the officers unvested stock options and the extension of the exercise period to 18
months for all options, the payment of COBRA benefits for up to six months, and the reimbursement of up to $25,000 for relocation expenses. During December 2002, the officer fully paid all outstanding principal and interest due under the promissory
note and Multilink paid severance and adjusted the officers options according to the separation agreement. 

During 2002, Multilink secured financing of $7.2 million through vendor financings and negotiated extended payment terms (generally payable within 12
months from purchase date) for another $2.6 million for some of its equipment and software needs. Multilink also received $1.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. 

During April 2002, Multilink entered into an unsecured $6.0 million credit
facility which was amended in December 2002. The agreement provided for two separate draw downs, referred to as Tranche A and Tranche B, and required that Multilink maintains (i) a liabilities to tangible net worth ratio of .50 to 1, (ii) a minimum
cash balance of $50 million and (iii) at least $12 million invested at the financial institution. During December 2002, Multilink amended this facility to eliminate these covenants, remove the draw down ability for Tranche B and to cash secure the
outstanding balance under Tranche A. The cash collateral is equal to 110% of the amount outstanding under the facility. No further amounts will be borrowed under this facility. 

As of March 31, 2003, cash equivalents of $2.7 million were considered restricted and are held as collateral pursuant to the
amended credit facility and $2.5 million was outstanding under Tranche A described above, of which $1.2 million, plus interest, is due within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2002, cash equivalents of $3.1 million were considered restricted
and is held as collateral pursuant to the amended credit facility and $2.8 million was outstanding under Tranche A described above, of which $1.2 million, plus interest, is due within the next 12 months. Interest under this facility is fixed at 4.0
percent per annum. 

Multilink operates in the semiconductor
industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. The semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a significant downturn. This downturn is characterized by diminished product demand, excess
customer inventories and excess production capacity. These factors have caused a substantial decrease in Multilinks revenues and in its results of operations. For example, during the first quarter of 2003 Multilink reported a net loss of $12.2
million and, as compared to the year ended 2002, reported a net reduction in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $11.4 million and a reduction in shareholders equity of $11.4 million. The substantial decrease in cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments is predominantly due to cash used in operations and for debt service requirements. At March 31, 2003, Multilink had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $36.2 million and working capital of
$21.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are expected to decrease throughout 2003. Multilink expects that its net cash usage will range from $36 to $38 million during 2003. Given the short maturity of Multilinks
short-term investments and their high liquidity, a material change in interest rates will not materially affect its liquidity. 



The current downturn and future downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and
any failure of this industry to recover from the current downturn will seriously impact Multilinks revenue and harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. Multilink will continue to experience losses and use its cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments if it does not receive sufficient product orders and its costs are not controlled. Multilink will continue to (i) focus on cash preservation and expense reductions, (ii) expand market share with existing
and new products by focusing on its strength in mixed signal and digital signal processing technology, (iii) rationalize research and development spending on projects that will be accretive to revenues in the near term and (iv) secure system design
wins with Tier I and emerging communication equipment and optical module manufacturers. 

As a result of the continuing significant economic slowdown and the related uncertainties in the technology sector and semiconductor industry, Multilink initiated its corporate realignment plan as discussed above. The
plan included workforce reductions of approximately 150 employees, the consolidation of facilities through closure of certain locations, a reduction in the level of activity at other locations and asset impairment charges. Multilink recorded a
charge during 2002 of $11.0 million associated with this realignment. The realignment plan will significantly reduce expenses and cash usage while permitting Multilinks crucial personnel to focus on key business strategies such as expanding
market share and securing design wins. Excluding the $4.9 million of cash necessary to execute the realignment plan, Multilink estimates that such plan, combined with the its other cost saving initiatives, will provide annual cash savings of
approximately $35.0 million. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, Multilink decided to make further headcount reductions to reduce headcount to 60 employees by September 2003. Based upon its actual revenues being below managements
expectations coupled with having very limited visibility to future revenues, Multilink concluded that these reductions in headcount were necessary in order to reduce cash usage and to position it for the future. Accordingly, during the second
quarter ended June 30, 2003, Multilink will record additional severance and termination benefit charges of approximately $1.5 million and asset impairment charges associated predominantly with purchased research and development software. Based upon
headcount reductions associated with Multilinks realignment plan, attrition in the normal course of business and headcount reductions as a result of Multilinks continuing efforts to reduce expenses across all functions, Multilinks
headcount is expected to be approximately 60 employees by September 2003. The headcount reductions have occurred at all of Multilinks locations in Europe, Israel and the United States. 

Although Multilink undertook cost reduction programs and initiated its
corporate realignment plan during 2002 to reduce expenses, it may still need additional capital. The market for its products has declined substantially; accordingly, Multilink will continue to utilize significant amounts of capital. In the event
that Multilink is required, or elects, to raise additional funds, it may not be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Multilinks inability to raise additional capital may result in the need to further restructure its operations. As an
alternative to raising capital, Multilink has entered into a merger agreement with Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation. Multilink cannot give any assurance that such a merger will occur. 

Multilinks decrease in revenues continues to reflect the limited demand for optical equipment in its end markets and
the additional reductions in carrier spending during 2002 and 2003. Multilinks business prospects depend substantially on the continued build-out of the communications infrastructure. Almost all telecommunication service providers have
curtailed the level of their capital expenditures on their infrastructure build-out, which has significantly reduced the demand for Multilinks products by communications equipment manufacturers. This slowdown has caused Multilinks
revenues and backlog to decline substantially. Multilinks revenues declined in each quarter of 2002, compared to the comparable periods in 2001. Because of general economic conditions and slowdowns in purchases of optical networking equipment,
it has become increasingly difficult for Multilink to predict the purchasing activities of its customers. Multilinks success in emerging from this prolonged downturn requires that it significantly reduces its cost structure to preserve cash
and enhance its ability to invest in opportunities that expand market share and grow revenues in new markets. Multilink will continue to focus on its strength in mixed-signal and digital signal processing technology and will expand into new markets
based upon this strength. Multilink has continued to secure design wins with Tier I and emerging 



communication equipment and optical module manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Multilinks exclusive focus is now on
building discrete components for communication equipment and optical module manufacturers. By focusing on components, Multilink ensures that its customers will have access to the best component technology and Multilink avoids competing with its
transceiver and transponder customers. 

Exclusive of obtaining
any new capital or material increases in revenues, Multilink believes that if it executes on the items discussed above, it will have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for at least the next fifteen months. The fifteen
months assumes that Multilink can execute on the items discussed above and that revenues meet its forecast. If Multilink cannot satisfactorily execute on the above items or if 2003 revenues are lower than Multilink expects, it will be required to
make further headcount and expense reductions which may limit certain operational abilities including, but not limited to, making new product introductions in a timely manner, obtaining design wins, procuring required raw materials and meeting
customer shipping schedules. If Multilink is able to obtain new capital and/or revenues grow greater than expected, Multilinks liquidity will exceed fifteen months. Based upon Multilinks cost reduction efforts, revenues of less than $10
million per quarter will be cash neutral to Multilink and any revenues in excess of this amount will generate positive cash flows from operations. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In June and August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
and SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, respectively. SFAS No. 143, which is effective for Multilink on January 1, 2003, requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No. 144, which was
effective for Multilink on January 1, 2002, establishes a single accounting model for the accounting of a discontinued segment of a business as well as addresses significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. The adoption of SFAS No. 143
did not have a material impact on Multilinks financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Multilink implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 144 to record the asset impairment charges discussed above. 

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. This differs from prior guidance, which required the
liability to be recognized when a commitment plan was put into place. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Multilink does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on Multilinks financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of SFAS No. 123, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results. Multilink has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002. Multilink accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any,
on the date of grant, between the fair value of Multilinks stock and the exercise price. 



Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Foreign Currency Risk 

Multilink develops and markets its products in North America, Europe and Asia. As a result, Multilinks financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in
foreign markets. As Multilinks sales are currently made or denominated in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the dollar could make its products less competitive in foreign markets. Although Multilink recognizes its revenues in U.S. dollars, it
incurs expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 

Multilink is exposed to fluctuations in the Euro, Lita and the Israeli shekel. During 2001, Multilink opened sales offices in Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom and during 2002 closed its Canadian office. Multilink is now exposed to
fluctuations in the British pound. The expenses of Multilinks foreign sales offices are not material. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, total expenses denominated in these currencies were $1.7 million or 13% of total expenses
before income taxes. Expenses denominated in the Euro and shekel represented approximately $0.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of foreign expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2003. During 2002, total expenses denominated in
these currencies were $17.4 million or 16% of total income before income taxes. During 2002, expenses denominated in the Euro represented approximately $10.5 million of foreign expenses, and expenses denominated in the shekel were approximately $6.6
million. Multilink expects that its foreign expenses will decrease as it continues to execute on its corporate realignment plan. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2003 and during 2002, Multilink did not enter into any foreign forward contracts and it currently has no foreign
forward contracts outstanding. Multilink does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on Multilinks operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to
variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, may cause Multilink to adjust its financing and operating strategies. Consequently, isolating the effect of changes in
currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Software and Equipment
Financings 

All of Multilinks software and equipment
financings have a fixed interest rate and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations. An immediate 100 basis point fluctuation in these rates would not have a material impact on Multilinks financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. 

Short-term Investments 

At March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Multilinks investment
portfolio included fixed and floating rate securities of $5.9 million and $15.0 million, respectively. The maximum maturity of these investments is 12 months with an overall dollar-weighted maturity of the portfolio of less than six months. Fixed
rate securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase whereas floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease. Accordingly, Multilinks future investment
income may not meet expectations as a result of interest rate fluctuations or a loss of principal may occur if Multilink was to sell securities that have declined in market value as a result of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of the
relatively short average maturity of the portfolio, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on Multilinks financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Multilink does not attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk
through the use of derivative financial instruments due to the short-term nature of its portfolio. 



Other Investments 

Multilinks other investments include several strategic investments in privately held companies. These investments have
an inherent level of risk associated with them, as they are comprised of investments in start-up or development stage companies. 

Multilink considers these investments long-term strategic investments. The market for these technologies or products that they have under development is
typically in the early stages, and may never materialize. Accordingly, Multilink could lose its entire investment in these companies. In fact, during the three months ended March 31, 2003, Multilink recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million on
its investment in IPAG and during 2002, recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million and $1.4 million on its investment in ASIP and IMC, respectively, because it believes that the reduction in these investments value is other than temporary.
Multilink also recorded an impairment charge of $2.4 million on equipment that it had consigned to ASIP. Multilink has also provided a guarantee for a lease of ASIP, which is an equity basis investment. The guarantee is through December 31, 2005,
provided that ASIP continues to meet all terms and conditions of the lease. The total remaining lease payments to be made by ASIP during the guarantee period are $0.9 million. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires Multilink to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Multilink
believes the most critical accounting policies that are significantly affected by these estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory reserves, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, warranty accruals, related party
transactions and equity-based compensation. 

Revenues
.    Multilink recognizes product revenues at the time of shipment. Multilinks customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase its products and can generally cancel or reschedule
orders on short notice. The recent slowdown in the build-out of the communications infrastructure has caused Multilinks revenues to grow less rapidly than they otherwise would have. In the ordinary course of business, Multilink receives order
cancellations and rescheduled shipments. To the extent possible, Multilink pursues order cancellation fees from its customers. Depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding these cancellation fees, the receipt of such fees may have an
immediate impact on revenues in the period that such fees are collected or the fees may need to be deferred and then recognized as revenue over some future period. Multilink cannot ensure that it will be able to collect an order cancellation fee for
each order cancelled and it cannot project how such fees will affect revenue.

Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable
.    Accounts receivable are reduced by a valuation allowance to estimate the amount that will actually be collected from Multilinks
customers. Many of Multilinks customers have been adversely affected by reduced carrier spending and have been paying Multilink slower than in the past and are attempting to negotiate longer payment terms. Multilinks customers are
aggressively managing their cash flows while other customers have virtually no cash flows and have filed for bankruptcy protection. If the financial condition of Multilinks customers were to materially deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. 

Inventory reserves
.    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories
are provided based on historical experience and current product demand. If Multilinks estimate of future demand is not correct or if its customers place significant order cancellations, actual inventory reserves could materially differ from
its estimate. Multilink may also receive orders for inventory that has been fully or partially reserved. To the extent that the sale of reserved inventory has a material impact on its financial results, Multilink will appropriately disclose such
effects. Multilinks inventory carrying costs are not material; thus it may not physically dispose of reserved inventory immediately. 



Valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets
.    Multilink records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. During 2002, Multilink concluded that significant uncertainty existed surrounding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. On a
quarterly basis, Multilink assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets by reviewing a number of factors, including operating trends, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future projections of taxable income, to determine
whether a valuation allowance is required to reduce such deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Based on the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are
realizable, Multilink believes that significant uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, during 2002, Multilink recorded a valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets. 

Warranty accruals
.    Multilinks warranty
costs are predominantly driven by product failure rates. Should actual failure rates differ from Multilinks estimates and vary significantly from historical trends, revisions in the estimated warranty liability would be required. Multilink has
also recently introduced many new products with no historical failure data. A material failure in a new product would materially affect the required warranty accrual. 

Related party transactions
.    Multilink enters into transactions with some of its equity holders
for various products used in both the manufacturing and research and development functions. Multilink enters into these transactions, as these parties are predominant, well-established suppliers in its industry for these products. 

Equity-based compensation
.    As part of its
compensation and retention structure, Multilink grants employees, officers and directors stock options and restricted stock. Prior to its initial public offering during June 2001, most of Multilinks stock options were issued at an exercise
price lower than Multilinks estimated fair market value. The difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair market value of the options is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity as deferred stock
compensation and amortized into expense over the vesting period of the options. Subsequent to its initial public offering, Multilink did not issue any options with an exercise price lower than the fair market value of its stock on the option grant
date. When Multilink issues restricted stock, it also records deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price, which is zero, and the fair market value of its stock on the grant date of the restricted stock. This amount is
also amortized into expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock. Multilink accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB Opinion No.
25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the fair value of Multilinks stock and the exercise price. Multilink accounts for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, and Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus on Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.
Multilink is amortizing deferred stock compensation using the graded vesting method, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28, over the vesting period of each respective option or restricted stock award, which
ranges from six months to four years. 

Corporate
Realignment
.    Multilink recorded a corporate realignment charge that includes estimated costs for severance and costs to exit leased facilities. If actual severance costs are higher than Multilinks estimate or if it
cannot sublease its vacant facilities as quickly as it anticipates and/or if the actual sublease income is less than Multilinks estimate, it may be required to record additional charges for these items in future periods. 

Long-Lived Asset Impairments
.
    Multilink
evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the
use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down is recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. For purposes of estimating future cash flows from possibly impaired assets, Multilink groups assets at the lowest
level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. For 



purposes of establishing fair value, Multilink generally uses information supplied by independent third parties or information Multilink obtained through
sales of similar assets to independent third parties. Accordingly, Multilink utilizes significant estimates in the calculation of potential longlived asset impairments. A material change in any of these estimates would materially effect
Multilinks conclusions.

Multilink Technology Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) are in the business of designing, developing, and marketing high-bandwidth, advanced integrated circuits, modules and
higher-level assemblies that enable next generation optical networking systems. The Company was incorporated in 1994, and is headquartered in Somerset, New Jersey. The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy,
