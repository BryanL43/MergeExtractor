Subject to Completion, dated June 5, 2003

The information in this proxy statement/prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This proxy statement/prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities, and we are not soliciting offers to buy these securities, in any state where
the offer or sale is not permitted.  

Dear Stockholders: 

        LendingTree, Inc.
has entered into a merger agreement that would result in LendingTree becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of USA Interactive. 

        If
LendingTree and USA complete the merger, each outstanding share of LendingTree common stock will be exchanged for 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock, and each share of LendingTree
preferred stock (other than shares held by holders who validly perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be exchanged for the number of shares of USA common stock that the holder would have
received had such preferred stock been converted into LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger. In the transaction, USA expects to issue approximately 18.3 million basic shares of
USA common stock and approximately 21 million shares on a fully diluted, treasury method basis, representing approximately 4.0% of the USA common stock outstanding as of May 15, 2003. 

        USA
common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "USAI," and LendingTree common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "TREE." Based upon
the closing price of USA common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on                , 2003, the last practicable trading day date before the
printing of this proxy statement/prospectus, 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock had a value of $                . You should be aware that,
because the number of shares of USA common stock you will receive in the merger is based on a fixed exchange ratio, the value of the consideration you will receive will fluctuate as the market price
of USA common stock changes. 

        We
cannot complete the merger unless, among other things, LendingTree's stockholders approve the merger agreement and a related amendment to the preferred stock certificate of
designations that is a part of LendingTree's certificate of incorporation to facilitate the merger. LendingTree will hold a special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote upon both of these
items on                ,                , 2003, beginning at 9:00 a.m.,
local time,
at its principal executive office located at 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277. 

YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.
    Regardless of the number of shares you own or whether you plan to attend the special meeting, it
is important that your shares be represented and voted. Voting instructions are inside. 

The board of directors of LendingTree unanimously recommends that LendingTree stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and "FOR" approval of the
charter amendment.

        The
accompanying proxy statement/prospectus and notice of special meeting of stockholders explains the proposed merger and charter amendment and provides specific information concerning
the special meeting. Please read these materials carefully. 

Please see "Risk Factors" beginning on page 16 for a discussion of matters that LendingTree stockholders should consider
before voting at the special meeting relating to an investment in USA common stock.

Sincerely,

Douglas R. Lebda

Chief Executive Officer

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the USA common stock to be
issued in the merger or determined if the information contained in this document is accurate or adequate. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The
date of this proxy statement/prospectus is                , 2003, and it is first

being mailed or otherwise delivered to LendingTree stockholders on or about                , 2003. 

LendingTree, Inc.

    NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
  TO BE HELD ON                ,
                , 2003    

        NOTICE
IS HEREBY GIVEN that LendingTree, Inc. will hold a special meeting of stockholders at LendingTree's principal executive office located at 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte,
North Carolina 28277 on        ,        , 2003, beginning at 9:00 a.m., local time, for the purpose of transacting the
following business: 

1.
To
consider and vote upon a proposal to approve an amendment to the preferred stock certificate of designations of LendingTree's Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock that is
part of the certificate of incorporation of LendingTree, Inc. (a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A).

2.
To
consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 5, 2003, by and among USA Interactive, Forest Merger Corp. and
LendingTree, Inc. (a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B).

3.
To
transact such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

        We
describe these items more fully in the proxy statement/prospectus attached to this notice, which we urge you to read. Please give your careful attention to all of the information in
the proxy statement/prospectus. As of the date of this notice, LendingTree's board of directors knows of no business to be conducted at the special meeting other than proposals 1 and 2 above. 

The board of directors of LendingTree unanimously recommends that LendingTree stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the charter amendment and "FOR" approval of the
merger agreement.

        Holders
of record of shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock at the close of business on                ,
2003 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement. 

        Approval
of the charter amendment is a condition to the completion of the merger. The approval by the holders of shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock
representing a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote, voting as a single class, with each share of LendingTree
common stock having one vote and each share of LendingTree preferred stock having one vote for each share of LendingTree common stock into which it is then convertible, is required to approve the
charter amendment and the merger agreement. In addition, the approval by the holders of 68.5% of the outstanding shares of LendingTree preferred stock, voting as a separate class, is required to
approve the charter amendment. Stockholders of LendingTree who as of the record date for the special meeting held, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately [31.2]%
of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an
as-converted basis, and approximately [71.8]% of the voting power of the outstanding LendingTree preferred stock, have agreed with USA to vote their shares in favor
of approval of the charter amendment and the merger agreement at the special meeting. 

        All
LendingTree stockholders are cordially invited to attend the special meeting. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting in person, please complete, date, sign and
return the enclosed proxy card(s) as promptly as possible to ensure your representation at the special meeting. We have enclosed a postage prepaid envelope for that purpose. Please note that
LendingTree is providing separate proxy cards for holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock and that any stockholder who holds both LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock 

should
receive two different proxy cards, both of which the stockholder will need to complete, sign, and return to have all shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock held by
such holder represented by proxy at the special meeting. It is important that you return your proxy to ensure the satisfaction of the quorum requirements for the conduct of business at the special
meeting of stockholders. Any LendingTree stockholder may revoke its proxy in the manner described in the proxy statement/prospectus at any time before the proxy has been voted at the special meeting.
Even if you have given your proxy, you may still vote in person if you attend the special meeting. Please do not send LendingTree any stock certificates at this time. 

        We
encourage you to vote on these very important matters. Your vote at the special meeting is very important. 

By
Order of the Board of Directors

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:
What is the proposed transaction?

A:
USA
is proposing to acquire LendingTree. The acquisition will be effected by the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of USA with and into LendingTree, with LendingTree surviving as a
wholly owned subsidiary of USA.

Q:
What will I receive in exchange for my LendingTree shares?

A:
If
you own shares of LendingTree common stock, you will receive 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock in exchange for each share of LendingTree common stock owned at the time we
complete the merger. If you own shares of LendingTree preferred stock, in exchange for each share of LendingTree preferred stock owned at the time we complete the merger (unless you properly exercise
appraisal rights), you will receive the number of shares of USA common stock that you would have received had you converted your LendingTree preferred stock into LendingTree common stock immediately
before the merger. The exact number of shares of USA common stock that you will receive in exchange for each share of LendingTree preferred stock depends on the date we complete the merger, because
under the preferred stock certificate of designations that is a part of LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, the formula for calculating the number of shares of LendingTree common stock into
which each share of LendingTree preferred stock is convertible takes into account the amount of accrued dividends on the LendingTree preferred stock from the last dividend payment date through the
conversion date. The minimum number of shares of USA common stock that you will receive in exchange for each share of LendingTree preferred stock is approximately 0.6726 of a share of USA common stock
(if we complete the merger on a quarterly dividend payment date) and the maximum is approximately 0.6859 of a share of USA common stock (if we complete the merger on the last day before a quarterly
dividend payment date), since each share of LendingTree preferred stock is convertible into between approximately 1.0850 and approximately 1.1065 shares of LendingTree common stock, depending on the
conversion date. 

USA
will not issue fractional shares of USA common stock. Any LendingTree stockholder otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of USA common stock will receive a cash payment instead of a
fractional share. 

Q:
What vote of LendingTree stockholders is needed to approve the merger agreement?

A:
Under
Delaware law and LendingTree's certificate of incorporation (after giving effect to the charter amendment described below), the approval by the holders of LendingTree common
shares and LendingTree preferred shares representing a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote, voting as a
single class, with each share of LendingTree common stock having one vote and each share of LendingTree preferred stock having one vote for each share of LendingTree common stock into which it is
convertible at the time of such vote (which we refer to as voting on an "as-converted basis"), is required in order to approve the merger agreement. As of the record date for the
LendingTree special meeting, LendingTree stockholders holding shares representing approximately [31.2]% of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares and
LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote on the merger agreement, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred shares voting on an as-converted basis, have agreed
with USA to vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement. 

i

Q:
Why are LendingTree stockholders being asked to approve an amendment to the preferred stock certificate of designations that is part of LendingTree's
certificate of incorporation?

A:
Approval
of the proposed charter amendment is a condition to the merger. The LendingTree preferred stock is currently convertible into LendingTree common stock at the option of each of
its holders. The proposed amendment to the LendingTree preferred stock certificate of designations that is a part of LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, or charter, provides for the treatment
of the LendingTree preferred stock in the merger as if it had been converted into LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger, as described above under "What will I receive in exchange for
my LendingTree shares?" As a result of this amendment, each preferred stockholder will receive consideration in the merger on an as-converted basis. In addition, while the holders of LendingTree
preferred stock will have a separate class vote on the approval of the charter amendment, the charter amendment will eliminate a separate class vote by the holders of the LendingTree preferred stock
on the merger agreement.

Q:
What vote of LendingTree stockholders is needed to approve the proposed charter amendment?

A:
Under
Delaware law and LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, the approval by the holders of LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares outstanding as of the date
for the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders representing a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote,
voting as a single class, with each share of LendingTree common stock having one vote and each share of LendingTree preferred stock having one vote for each share of LendingTree common stock into
which it is then convertible, is required in order to approve the proposed charter amendment. In addition, the approval by the holders of 68.5% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock outstanding
as of the date of the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders, voting as a separate class, is required to approve the proposed charter amendment. As of the record date for the special meeting,
LendingTree stockholders holding shares representing approximately [31.2]% of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled
to vote on the proposed charter amendment, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis, have agreed with USA to vote in favor of
approval of the proposed charter amendment. Because the shares of LendingTree preferred stock that these stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the proposed charter amendment represent
approximately [71.8]% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting, approval of the proposed charter amendment in the
separate class vote by the holders of the LendingTree preferred stock is assured.

Q:
When and where will LendingTree hold the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders?

A:
LendingTree
will hold the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders at LendingTree's principal executive office located at 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina
28277 on                ,                , 2003, beginning at 9:00 a.m.,
local time.

Q:
Will I have appraisal rights in connection with the merger?

A
Under
Delaware law, holders of LendingTree preferred stock will be entitled to appraisal rights. For a detailed discussion of the appraisal rights of holders of LendingTree preferred
stock, see "The MergerAppraisal Rights." Holders of LendingTree common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

ii

Q:
Will LendingTree stockholders be taxed on the USA common stock that they receive in exchange for their LendingTree shares?

A:
The
exchange of shares by LendingTree stockholders is intended to be tax-free to LendingTree stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except for taxes on cash
received instead of fractional shares of USA common stock and cash received by holders of shares of LendingTree preferred stock properly exercising appraisal rights in connection with the merger. We
recommend that LendingTree stockholders carefully read the complete explanation of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger beginning on page 50, and that LendingTree
stockholders consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences to them.

Q:
Will you complete the merger if LendingTree stockholders approve the merger agreement but fail to approve the proposed charter
amendment?

A:
No.
The effectiveness of the proposed charter amendment is a condition to the completion of the merger.

Q:
Can I vote "FOR" one proposal and "AGAINST" the other?

A:
Yes.
However, completion of the merger is contingent upon approval of the charter amendment, and the charter amendment will have no force or effect if we do not complete the merger.
Accordingly, the board of directors of LendingTree recommends that you vote in favor of both proposals.

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reviewing this proxy statement/prospectus, indicate on your proxy card(s) how you want to vote on the proposed charter amendment and how you want to vote on the merger
agreement. Please note that LendingTree is providing separate proxy cards for holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. If you hold both LendingTree common stock and
LendingTree preferred stock, please complete and return both of the provided proxy cards. Then sign, date and mail your proxy card(s) in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your
shares may be represented at the special meeting. 

If
you do not sign and send in your proxy card and do not attend and cast your vote in person at the LendingTree special meeting, such inaction will have the effect of voting against the proposed
charter amendment and voting against the merger agreement. 

If
you sign, date and send in your proxy card, but do not indicate how you want to vote on either or both proposals, your proxy card will be voted in favor of such proposal or proposals for which you
did not indicate how you want to vote. 

After
we complete the merger, LendingTree stockholders will receive written instructions and a letter of transmittal for exchanging their shares of LendingTree common stock and/or LendingTree
preferred stock for shares of USA common stock and cash instead of fractional shares of USA common stock. 
Please do not send in your LendingTree stock certificates until you
receive the instructions and letter of transmittal.

Q:
If my LendingTree shares are held in street name by my broker, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?

A:
No.
Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote. You should fill out the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker with
this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to instruct your broker will have the effect of voting against the merger agreement and voting against the proposed charter amendment.

Q:
May I change my vote even after submitting a proxy card?

A:
Yes.
If you are a holder of record, there are three ways you can change your proxy 

iii

instructions
after you have submitted your proxy card. First, you may send a written notice to the person to whom you submitted your proxy revoking your proxy. Second, you may complete and submit a
new proxy card. The latest proxy actually received by LendingTree before the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders will be counted, and any earlier proxies will be revoked. Third, you may attend
the LendingTree special meeting and vote in person. Any earlier proxy will thereby be revoked. However, simply attending the meeting without voting will not revoke your proxy. 

If

Forest Merger Corp.

c/o USA Interactive

152 West 57th Street

New York, New York 10019

(212) 314-7300 

        Forest
Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of USA created solely for the purpose of effecting the merger. In the merger, Forest Merger Corp. will be merged
with and into LendingTree, with LendingTree surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of USA. 

The Merger (Page 27)  

        In the merger, Forest Merger Corp. will merge with and into LendingTree, and LendingTree will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of USA. In the
merger, each share of LendingTree common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock and each share of LendingTree preferred stock (unless the holder
properly exercises appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of USA common stock that the holder would have received had its LendingTree preferred stock been
converted into LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger. Any LendingTree stockholder entitled to receive a fractional share of USA common stock after giving effect to the conversion of
all LendingTree shares owned by the stockholder will receive a cash payment instead of the fractional share. In the transaction, USA expects to issue approximately 18.3 million basic shares of
USA common stock and approximately 21 million shares on a fully diluted, treasury method basis, representing approximately 4.0% 

of
the USA common stock outstanding as of May 15, 2003. 

        The
merger agreement is the legal document that governs the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We have attached the merger agreement as
Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read it carefully in its entirety. 

Charter Amendment (Page 26)  

        At the LendingTree special meeting, LendingTree will ask its stockholders to approve an amendment to the LendingTree preferred stock certificate of designations
that is a part of LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, or charter. We have provided the full text of the proposed charter amendment in Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus. If
LendingTree stockholders approve the charter amendment proposal by the required votes, LendingTree will effect the charter amendment by filing a certificate of amendment to LendingTree's certificate
of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 59)  

        You should be aware that a number of directors and officers of LendingTree have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder of LendingTree. Both the directors and officers of LendingTree may have interests that include, among others, the vesting of options and other equity-based awards in
connection with the merger. Certain executive officers of LendingTree will have a continuing equity interest in the surviving corporation following the merger and interests under existing employment
continuity agreements with LendingTree. In addition, a USA subsidiary, Forest Merger Corp., has entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers of LendingTree that will become
effective at the time we complete the merger. Further, the directors and officers of LendingTree have an interest in continuing rights to liability insurance and indemnification for losses relating to
his or her service as an officer or director of LendingTree before the merger. 

Votes Required; Voting Agreements (Page 24)  

        Under Delaware law and LendingTree's certificate of incorporation (after giving effect to the proposed charter amendment described above), the approval by the
holders of LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares representing a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares
entitled to vote, voting as a single class, is required to approve the merger agreement. In this vote, each share of LendingTree common stock will have one vote, and each share of LendingTree
preferred stock will have approximately        votes. 

        Under
Delaware law and LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, the approval by the holders of LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares representing a majority of
the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class, is required to approve the proposed amendment to
LendingTree's certificate of incorporation. In this vote, each share of LendingTree common stock will have one vote, and each share of LendingTree preferred stock will have approximately
        votes. In addition, the approval by the holders of 68.5% of the outstanding shares of LendingTree preferred stock, voting as a separate class, is required to
approve the proposed charter amendment. 

        As
of the record date for the special meeting, LendingTree stockholders, including an executive officer and director and an entity with which two directors are associated, holding shares
representing approximately [31.2]% of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote on the proposed charter
amendment and the merger agreement, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis, have agreed 

with
USA to vote in favor of approval of the proposed charter amendment and the merger agreement. Because the shares of LendingTree preferred stock that these stockholders have agreed to vote in favor
of the proposed charter amendment represent approximately [71.8]% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting, approval
of the proposed charter amendment in the separate class vote by the holders of the LendingTree preferred stock is assured. 

        As
of the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive officers of LendingTree and their affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned and had the right to
vote                shares of LendingTree common stock
and                shares of
LendingTree preferred stock, representing an aggregate of approximately                % of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares
and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote at the special meeting, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred shares voting on an as-converted basis, and
approximately                % of the LendingTree preferred stock voting as a separate class. LendingTree expects directors and executive officers
of LendingTree and their affiliates to vote their LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock in favor of the proposed charter amendment and the approval of the merger agreement. Certain
directors and executive officers of LendingTree and/or entities associated or affiliated with them, who, together, beneficially own shares representing
approximately                % of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares entitled to vote at the
special meeting, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred shares voting on an as-converted basis, and
approximately                % of the LendingTree preferred stock voting as a separate class, have agreed with USA to vote in favor of the proposed
charter amendment and the approval of the merger agreement. 

Reasons for the Merger (Pages 31 and 50)  

        The board of directors of LendingTree believes that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock. For a description of the factors on which the board of directors based its determination, see "The MergerLendingTree's Reasons for the Merger." 

        The
board of directors of USA believes that the merger is in the best interests of USA. See "The MergerUSA's Reasons for the Merger." 

Recommendations to LendingTree Stockholders  

        The board of directors of LendingTree unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the charter
amendment, and unanimously recommends that LendingTree stockholders vote at the special meeting 
"FOR"
 approval of the charter amendment and 

"FOR"
 approval
of the merger agreement. 

        You
should refer to the factors considered by the LendingTree board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger agreement and the charter amendment (see "The
MergerRecommendation of the LendingTree Board of Directors" on page 31 and "The MergerLendingTree's Reasons for the Merger" on page 31). 

Opinions of LendingTree's Financial Advisors (Page 35)  

        In deciding to recommend approval of the merger agreement and the charter amendment, the board of directors of LendingTree considered the separate opinions of its
financial advisors, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Allen & Company LLC, each to the effect that, as of May 5, 2003, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the written opinions, the exchange ratio under the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of LendingTree
common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. The full text of the written opinion of Merrill Lynch, dated May 5, 2003, is attached as Appendix C to 

this
proxy statement/prospectus, and the full text of the written opinion of Allen & Company, dated May 5, 2003, is attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus. We
encourage you to read these opinions carefully for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. These opinions are directed
to LendingTree's board of directors and do not constitute recommendations to any holder of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock as to how any such stockholder should vote on any of
the proposals that will be considered at the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders. 

Treatment of LendingTree Stock Options (Page 70)  

        If we successfully complete the merger, options to acquire shares of LendingTree common stock will be converted into options to acquire shares of USA common
stock, with the number of shares that each option represents a right to purchase and the exercise price per share being adjusted based on the merger exchange ratio, and with the options otherwise
having the same terms. 

Treatment of LendingTree Warrants (Page 71)  

        If we successfully complete the merger, USA will assume LendingTree's common stock warrants outstanding prior to the merger. As a result, warrants to purchase
LendingTree common stock outstanding before the merger will become, following the merger, warrants to purchase shares of USA common stock, with the number of shares that each warrant represents a
right to purchase and the exercise price per share being adjusted based on the merger exchange ratio, and with the warrants otherwise having the same terms. Where the LendingTree warrant permits
LendingTree to deliver cash to the holder instead of converting the warrant into a warrant to purchase USA common shares as described above, LendingTree has agreed to elect to cash out the warrant if
USA requests it do so. 

Regulatory Approvals (Page 56)  

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Act, USA and LendingTree may not complete the merger before furnishing required
information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated. Effective May 27, 2003, the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated early. 

        In
connection with proposed merger, we must also file applications or notifications with governmental entities under various laws, including those regulating real estate brokers or
agents, loan brokers and mortgage brokers and bankers. These governmental entities may disapprove the change in control of LendingTree as a result of the merger based upon the criteria in the
applicable laws and regulations. We are not obligated under the merger agreement to complete the merger unless the surviving corporation has obtained the required regulatory approvals to continue to
operate LendingTree's businesses in California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, and in such other states which, when taken together
with the ten specified states, represent at least 95% of LendingTree's consolidated revenue for 2002. LendingTree and USA currently anticipate receiving the necessary approvals in the third quarter of
2003. 

Non-Solicitation Covenant (Page 76)  

        LendingTree has agreed in the merger agreement not to initiate, solicit, negotiate, knowingly encourage or provide confidential information to facilitate any
proposal or offer to acquire more than 25% of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries, or capital stock of LendingTree or any of its subsidiaries representing more than
15% of the total voting power of all of the entity's voting securities. This covenant is subject to exceptions in connection with unsolicited bona fide written offers for potential or proposed
acquisition transactions under specified 

circumstances,
which we describe more fully under "The Merger AgreementCovenantsAcquisition Transactions." 

Termination of the Merger Agreement; Effects of Termination (Page 82)  

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time: 


By
USA's and LendingTree's mutual written consent.


By
either USA or LendingTree if any governmental entity that must grant a regulatory approval described as a condition to closing under "The Merger
AgreementConditions to the Merger" has denied its approval and the denial has become final and nonappealable, or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final
nonappealable order permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.


By
LendingTree, under certain circumstances, if USA has breached any of its covenants or representations in the merger agreement and the breach is not cured within
30 days following written notice or cannot be cured before the closing date of the merger.


By
USA, under certain circumstances, if (1) LendingTree has breached any of its covenants or representations in the merger agreement, or (2) any LendingTree
stockholder party to one of the voting agreements entered into in connection with the merger agreement has materially breached its obligations under the voting agreement which breach, in either case,
is not cured within 30 days following written notice or cannot be cured before the closing date of the merger.


By
LendingTree if prior to receipt of the required stockholder approvals of the merger agreement and the proposed charter amendment:

(1)
LendingTree
receives a "superior proposal";

(2)
LendingTree
has promptly notified USA of its intention to terminate the merger agreement and has complied with its obligations described under "The Merger
AgreementCovenantsAcquisition Transactions";

(3)
if
requested by USA, within two business days after USA's receipt of the full details of the terms and conditions of the superior proposal, LendingTree has negotiated during the
following five business days with USA to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would enable LendingTree to proceed with the merger on such adjusted terms, and
notwithstanding those negotiations and adjustments, the board of directors of LendingTree concludes, in its good faith judgment, that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the terms
as adjusted, are not at least as favorable to the stockholders of LendingTree as the superior proposal; and

(4)
the
board of directors of LendingTree resolves to accept the superior proposal after having received and considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent,
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of LendingTree's board of directors under applicable law. 

Termination
of the merger agreement by LendingTree under this provision will not be effective until LendingTree pays USA a fee of $25 million. 


By
USA, if the board of directors of LendingTree has failed to recommend, or has withdrawn, or modified in any respect 

materially
adverse to USA, its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or has resolved to take any of these actions, or has recommended another "acquisition proposal," or if the board of
directors of LendingTree has resolved to accept a superior proposal or has failed publicly to affirm its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement within ten days of USA's request made after
any acquisition proposal has been disclosed to LendingTree's stockholders generally. 

If
LendingTree terminates the merger agreement under this provision, LendingTree must pay USA a fee of $10 million within two business days of the termination, and an additional
$15 million on the earliest to occur of the one-year anniversary of the termination date, the date that LendingTree, directly or indirectly, enters into a definitive agreement for
an "acquisition transaction" or the date that an acquisition transaction is consummated. 


By
USA or LendingTree if the stockholders of LendingTree fail to approve the merger agreement upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders called for that purpose
(including any adjournment or postponement). 

If
LendingTree or USA terminates the merger agreement under this provision, LendingTree must pay USA a fee of $25 million if: 

(1)
at
the time of the LendingTree stockholder meeting an acquisition proposal involving more than 33% of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the
capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries has been disclosed publicly or to LendingTree; and

(2)
within
12 months of termination of the merger agreement, LendingTree, directly or indirectly, enters into a definitive agreement for an acquisition transaction involving more
than 33% of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries or such an acquisition transaction is consummated.


By
USA or LendingTree if the merger has not occurred by December 5, 2003, unless due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform
its covenants and agreements in the merger agreement. However, if on December 5, 2003 each of the conditions to the merger, other than those relating to LendingTree stockholder approvals,
required regulatory approvals and/or the existence of injunctions or other legal bars or governmental proceedings, has been satisfied or is capable of being satisfied, then the date on which a party
may terminate the merger agreement under this provision will be automatically extended to February 5, 2004. 

LendingTree
must pay USA a fee of $25 million if LendingTree terminates the merger agreement under this provision and if, at the time of the termination, the following conditions are met: 

(1)
USA
would have been permitted to terminate the merger agreement because of a willful or bad faith breach by LendingTree of any material covenant or agreement contained in the merger
agreement;

(2)
prior
to such termination, an acquisition proposal has been disclosed publicly or to LendingTree that contemplates direct or indirect consideration for the LendingTree common stock
and LendingTree preferred stock (including the value of any stub equity) in excess of the aggregate merger consideration payable under the merger agreement; and

(3)
within
12 months following the termination, LendingTree directly or 

indirectly
enters into a definitive agreement for an acquisition transaction involving more than 33% of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the capital stock
of LendingTree or its subsidiaries or such an acquisition transaction is consummated. 

Resale of USA Common Stock (Page 57)  

        Shares of USA common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to any restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act, except for shares of USA
common stock issued to affiliates of either USA or LendingTree. 

Accounting Treatment (Page 57)  

        USA will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 

Comparison of Stockholder Rights  

        If we successfully complete the merger, each LendingTree stockholder will become a stockholder of USA. Delaware law and USA's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws govern the rights of USA stockholders. While LendingTree is also governed by Delaware law, USA stockholders' rights under USA's certificate of incorporation and bylaws differ in some respects
from LendingTree stockholders' rights under LendingTree's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. For a summary of these material differences, see the discussion beginning on page 102 of this
proxy statement/prospectus. 

Appraisal Rights (Page 53)  

        Under Delaware law, holders of LendingTree preferred stock will be entitled to appraisal rights. For a detailed discussion of the appraisal rights of holders of
LendingTree preferred stock, see "The MergerAppraisal Rights." Holders of LendingTree common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Tax Consequences  

        The exchange of shares by LendingTree stockholders is intended to be tax-free to LendingTree stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except
for taxes on cash received instead of fractional shares of USA common stock and cash received by holders of shares of LendingTree preferred stock properly exercising appraisal rights in connection
with the merger. We recommend that LendingTree stockholders carefully read the complete explanation of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger beginning on page 50, and
that LendingTree stockholders consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences to them.

Certain Historical and Pro Forma Per Share Data    

Unaudited Comparative Per Share Data  

        In the following table we present historical per share data for USA and LendingTree as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2002, and combined pro forma per share data for USA and equivalent pro forma per share data for LendingTree as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2003 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002. The pro forma per share data, which we present for comparative purposes only, assumes that the Ticketmaster merger completed on
January 17, 2003, the proposed Expedia merger, the proposed Hotels.com merger and the LendingTree transaction had each been completed at the beginning of each fiscal period presented for income
statement purposes and for balance sheet purposes it assumes that the Expedia merger, Hotels.com merger and the LendingTree transaction had been completed on March 31, 2003. The unaudited pro
forma per share data does not reflect any payment that may be required to be made in connection with the exercise of dissenters' rights by holders of Expedia common stock in connection with the
Expedia merger. USA did not declare any cash dividends on its common stock during the periods presented. 

        The
unaudited comparative per share data does not purport to be, and you should not rely on it as, indicative of (1) the results of operations or financial position which would
have been achieved if any of the foregoing transactions had been completed at the beginning of the period or as of the date indicated, or (2) the results of operations or financial position
which may be achieved in the future. 

        It
is important that when you read this information, you read along with it the separate financial statements and accompanying notes of USA and LendingTree that we have incorporated by
reference into this document. It is also important that you read the pro forma combined condensed financial information and accompanying notes that we have included in this proxy statement/prospectus

Calculated
beginning February 15, 2000. 

        On
May 2, 2003, the last trading day before we announced the merger, USA common stock closed at $34.96 per share and LendingTree common stock closed at $14.69 per
share. On                , 2003, the last practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus, USA common stock closed
at $                per share and LendingTree common stock closed at
$                per
share. You may obtain more recent stock price quotes from most newspapers or other financial sources, and we encourage you to do so. 

        USA
has never paid any cash dividends on shares of USA common stock, and LendingTree has never paid any cash dividends on shares of LendingTree common stock. USA and LendingTree
currently anticipate that they will retain all of their future earnings available for distribution to the holders of USA common stock and LendingTree common stock, respectively, for use in the
expansion and operation of their respective businesses, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of USA common stock or LendingTree common stock in the immediate future. 

        The
holders of LendingTree preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends on their shares equal to eight percent (8%) per annum of the stated value per share payable at LendingTree's
option in cash on each quarterly dividend date or by an upward adjustment to the stated value per share on a quarterly dividend payment date. LendingTree's revolving credit agreement with GE Capital
Commercial Services, or GE, prohibits LendingTree from paying cash dividends on LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock without the prior written consent of GE. LendingTree obtained
the consent of GE to pay cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and paid such dividends in cash for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2002, September 30, 2002,
December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003. LendingTree also has obtained GE's consent for the payment of cash dividends for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2003. LendingTree has
notified GE of its intention to permit the credit agreement to expire on July 13, 2003. While the merger is pending, the merger agreement requires LendingTree to make all required dividend
payments on the LendingTree preferred stock in cash. 

RISK FACTORS    

        As a result of the merger, LendingTree's stockholders will be subject to the following new or increased risks related to USA's other businesses and/or the
structure of the merger. In addition, as a result of the merger, USA's stockholders will be subject to the following new or increased risks related to LendingTree and/or the structure of the merger.
In addition to the risks described below, the combined company will continue to be subject to the risks described in the documents that LendingTree and USA have filed with the SEC that are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. If any of the risks described below or in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus actually occur,
the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the combined company could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below should be considered along with the
other information included or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Risk Factors Relating to the Merger    

The number of shares of USA common stock that holders of LendingTree common stock and Lending Tree preferred stock will receive in the merger will be based upon a fixed
exchange ratio. The value of the shares of USA common stock at the time LendingTree stockholders receive them could be less than the value of those shares today.

        In
the merger, each share of LendingTree common stock will be exchanged for 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock, and each share of LendingTree preferred stock will be exchanged for a
number of shares of USA common stock based on the same exchange ratio and the rate of conversion of LendingTree preferred stock to LendingTree common stock set forth in the certificate of designations
of the LendingTree preferred stock. USA and LendingTree will not adjust the exchange ratio as a result of any change in the market price of USA common stock between the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the date the LendingTree stockholders receive shares of USA common stock in exchange for shares of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock. The market price of
USA common stock will likely be different, and may be lower, on the date LendingTree stockholders receive shares of USA common stock from the market price of shares of USA common stock today as a
result of changes in the business, operations or prospects of USA, market reactions to the proposed merger, general market and economic conditions and other factors. Because we will complete the
merger only after LendingTree holds its special meeting of stockholders, the price of the USA common stock on the date of the special meeting of stockholders will not necessarily be indicative
of the price of the USA common stock at the time we complete the merger. LendingTree stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for USA common stock and LendingTree common stock. See
"SummaryComparative Per Share Market Price Information and Dividend Policy." 

The trading price of USA common stock may be affected by factors different from or in addition to the factors affecting the trading price of LendingTree common stock or the
price at which holders of LendingTree preferred stock may be able to sell their preferred shares.

        If
the merger is completed, all holders of outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock immediately prior to the merger will become holders of USA
common stock. USA owns and operates in a number of lines of business. Accordingly, USA's results of operations and business, as well as the trading price of USA common stock, may be affected by
factors different from or in addition to those affecting LendingTree's results of operations and business and the price of LendingTree common stock. 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the price of LendingTree common stock or the price at which holders of LendingTree preferred stock may be able to sell
those shares and LendingTree's future business and operations.

        If
we do not complete the merger for any reason, LendingTree may be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 


LendingTree
may be obligated to pay USA a fee of $25 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances;


the
current market price of LendingTree common stock may reflect a market assumption that we will complete the merger, and a failure to complete the merger could result in a
decline in the market price of the LendingTree common stock;


many
costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and financial printing fees, must be paid regardless of whether we complete the merger; and


there
may be substantial disruption to the businesses of LendingTree and a distraction of its management and employees from day-to-day operations. 

Risk Factors Relating to USA    

 USA depends on its key personnel.  

        USA is dependent upon the continued contributions of its senior corporate management, particularly Barry Diller, the chairman and chief executive officer of USA,
and certain key employees for its future success. Mr. Diller does not have an employment agreement with USA, although he has been granted options to purchase a substantial number of shares of
USA common stock. 

        If
Mr. Diller no longer serves in his positions at USA, USA's business, as well as the market price of USA common stock, could be substantially adversely affected. USA cannot
assure you that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller or any other members of its senior management or key employees. 

USA is controlled by Mr. Diller and in his absence will be controlled by Liberty Media Corporation.

        Subject
to the terms of an amended and restated stockholders agreement, dated as of December 16, 2001, among Universal Studios, Inc., or Universal, Liberty,
Mr. Diller and Vivendi, Mr. Diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of USA's stockholders (other than with respect to the election
by the holders of USA common stock of 25% of the members of USA's board of directors (rounded up to the nearest whole number) and matters as to which a separate class vote of the holders of USA common
stock or USA preferred stock is required under Delaware law). 

        In
addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement, dated as of December 16, 2001, among USA, Vivendi, Universal, Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of
Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that USA's ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the governance agreement, equals or exceeds 4:1
over a continuous 12-month period.
USA cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when USA is highly leveraged, in which case USA would not be able to engage in such transactions or
take such actions. 

        Upon
Mr. Diller's permanent departure from USA, Liberty generally would be able to control USA through its ownership of shares of USA Class B common stock. 

USA's success depends on maintaining the integrity of its systems and infrastructure.

        A
fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information, such as credit card numbers or other personal information, over
public networks. USA's current security measures may not be adequate and, if any compromise of USA's security were to occur, it could have a detrimental effect on USA's reputation and adversely affect
its ability to attract customers. As USA's operations continue to grow in both size and scope, USA will need to improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure. This may require USA to commit
substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. 

        USA
relies on its own affiliates' and third-party computer systems and service providers to facilitate and process a portion of its transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in
these services, or a deterioration in their performance, could impair USA's ability to process transactions for its customers and the quality of service USA can offer to them. It is unlikely that USA
could make up for the level of orders lost in these circumstances by increased phone orders. 

System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in USA's information systems may affect USA's business.

        USA's
subsidiaries rely on computer and other systems in order to provide their services to customers. At times, USA subsidiaries may experience occasional system interruptions that make
some or all systems unavailable or prevent the subsidiaries from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. To prevent system interruptions, USA and its subsidiaries
continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade systems and network infrastructure to accommodate both increased traffic on websites and increased sales volume. Computer and
communications systems of USA and its subsidiaries could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism,
acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could
cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent USA subsidiaries from providing services to third parties. While USA and its subsidiaries do have backup systems for
certain aspects of operations, the systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, USA and its subsidiaries may have inadequate
insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of this were to occur, it could damage the reputation of USA and its subsidiaries and be expensive to
remedy. 

Declines or disruptions in the industries in which USA operates, such as those caused by terrorism, war or general economic downturns, could harm USA's businesses. In addition,
negative financial performance of companies in which USA is the majority stockholder can have a negative effect on USA's stock price.

        USA's
businesses in general are sensitive to trends or events that are outside of USA's control. For example, adverse trends or events, such as general economic downturns, decreases in
consumer spending, work stoppages and political instability, may reduce the popularity and frequency of the events to which USA sells tickets, reduce travel and may affect call center and other
operations in areas where these trends or events occur. The occurrence of any of these adverse trends or events could significantly impact USA's businesses, results of operations or financial
condition. In addition, USA's stock price may be adversely affected by negative reports of the results of operations or declines in the stock price of companies in which USA is a major stockholder,
regardless of the effect these negative reports or stock price declines may have on USA's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. 

Travel is highly sensitive to traveler safety concerns, and thus declines after acts of terrorism that impact the perceived safety of travelers, could significantly impact
USA's businesses, results of operations or financial condition.

        In
the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the travel industry experienced a protracted decrease in demand for air travel due to fears regarding additional
acts of terrorism and increased costs and reduced operations by airlines due, in part, to new security directives adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration. USA cannot predict the future scope
and effects of these changes, which could significantly impact USA's long-term results of operations or financial condition. 

USA may experience operational and financial risks in connection with its acquisitions. In addition, some of the businesses USA acquires may incur significant losses from
operations or experience impairment of carrying value.

        USA's
future growth may be a function, in part, of acquisitions. To the extent that USA grows through acquisitions, it will face the operational and financial risks commonly encountered
with that type of a strategy. USA would also face operational risks, such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting its ongoing business, dissipating
its limited management resources and impairing its relationships with employees and customers of acquired businesses as a result of changes in ownership and management. Some of USA's acquisitions may
not be successful and their performances may result in the impairment of their carrying value. 

Changing laws and regulations, and legal uncertainties, regarding the Internet may impair USA's growth and harm its businesses.

        A
number of proposed laws and regulations regarding the Internet, including with respect to consumer privacy, have been proposed or considered that could impact USA's businesses. USA
cannot predict whether any of these types of laws or regulations will be enacted or amended and what effect, if any, such laws or regulations would have on its businesses, financial condition or
results of operations. In addition, the application of various sales, use and other tax provisions under state and local law to USA's historical and new products and services sold via the Internet,
television and telephone is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities. USA believes it is compliant with these tax provisions, but there can be no assurances that taxing
authorities will not take a contrary position or that such positions will not have a material adverse effect on USA's businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

THE LENDINGTREE SPECIAL MEETING    

        This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished to LendingTree stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by LendingTree's board of directors from
the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock for use at the special meeting of LendingTree stockholders. This proxy statement/prospectus is also furnished to LendingTree
stockholders as a prospectus of USA in connection with the issuance by USA of shares of USA common stock to LendingTree stockholders in connection with the merger. 

        We
are first furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to LendingTree's stockholders on or about                , 2003. 

Time and Place; Purposes  

        LendingTree will hold the special meeting on        ,        , 2003 at 9:00 a.m., local
time, at LendingTree's principal executive office located at 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277. At the special meeting (and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting),
LendingTree common stockholders and LendingTree preferred stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the charter amendment and a proposal to approve the merger
agreement. 

Record Date  

        The board of directors of LendingTree has fixed the close of business on                , 2003 as
the record
date for the determination of the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Only holders of record of shares
of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock on the record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were
                shares of LendingTree common stock outstanding held by approximately
                holders of record and                shares of LendingTree
preferred stock
outstanding held by                holders of record. Any shares of LendingTree preferred stock outstanding on the record date for the
LendingTree special meeting that a holder converts into shares of LendingTree common stock after the record date will not be entitled to be voted at the special meeting. 

Recommendation of the LendingTree Board of Directors  

        The board of directors of LendingTree unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger
and the charter amendment, and unanimously recommends that stockholders vote at the special meeting 
"FOR"
 approval of the charter amendment and 

"FOR"

approval of the merger agreement. 

Quorum; Votes Required for Approval  

        The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the votes eligible to be cast by the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis, is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting, and a
majority of the votes eligible to be cast by the LendingTree preferred stockholders as a class is necessary to constitute a quorum for the separate vote by the holders of preferred stock as a class on
the proposed charter amendment. At the special meeting: 


(1)
the shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock voting together as a single class, with each share of LendingTree common stock having one vote and
each share of LendingTree preferred stock having approximately    votes, and (2) the shares of LendingTree 

preferred
stock voting as a separate class, with each share of LendingTree preferred stock having one vote, will vote on the proposal to approve the charter amendment, 


if
the charter amendment is approved, LendingTree will effect the charter amendment by filing a certificate of amendment to LendingTree's certificate of incorporation with
the Delaware Secretary of State before taking the vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement, and


the
shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock voting together as a single class, with each share of LendingTree common stock having one vote and
each share of LendingTree preferred stock having approximately    votes, will then vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. 

        Approval
of the charter amendment requires the affirmative vote of (1) a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock entitled to vote, voting as a single class, with each share of LendingTree common stock having one vote and each share of LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis,
and (2) holders of at least 68.5% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote. In addition, because approval of the charter amendment is a condition to the completion of the
merger, the failure of the stockholders to approve the charter amendment will have the effect of preventing the completion of the merger. Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote, voting as a single class, with each share of LendingTree
common stock having one vote and each share of LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis. 

        USA
has entered into voting agreements with certain of LendingTree's principal stockholders who held, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately [31.2]%
of the total voting power of the outstanding LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, and approximately [71.8]% of the
voting power of the outstanding LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Under the voting agreements, each of these stockholders has given USA his, her or its irrevocable
proxy to vote the LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares held by the stockholder in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the charter amendment at the special meeting
(or any adjournment or postponement). Because these shares represent approximately [71.8]% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote at the special meeting,
approval of the proposed charter amendment in the separate class vote by the holders of the LendingTree preferred stock is assured. 

Voting; Revocation of Proxies  

        You may cause your LendingTree shares to be voted by returning the enclosed proxy card(s) by mail or voting in person at the special meeting. Please note that
LendingTree is providing separate proxy cards for holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock and that any stockholder
who holds both LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock should receive two different proxy cards, both of which the stockholder will need to complete, sign and return to have all
shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock held by such holder represented by proxy at the special meeting. The proxies will vote all shares of LendingTree common stock and
LendingTree preferred stock represented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the special meeting, unless revoked, in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards.
If you do not indicate instructions for a proposal on a properly executed and delivered proxy, the proxies will vote the shares covered by the proxy
"
FOR
" the proposal. We urge you to mark your proxy card(s) to indicate how to vote your shares. 

        Abstentions
may be specified on either proposal. LendingTree will count a properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to either proposal as present for purposes of determining
whether there is a quorum. Because approval of the proposal to approve the merger agreement at the special 

meeting
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote, whether or not
voted, a proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to that proposal will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Similarly, because approval of the proposal to approve the charter amendment at the
special meeting requires the affirmative vote of both (1) a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote and (2) a specified percentage
of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock entitled to vote, whether or not voted, a proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to the
proposal to approve the charter amendment will have the effect of a vote against the proposal to approve the charter amendment. In addition, the failure of a LendingTree stockholder to return a proxy
and to vote in person at the special meeting will have the effect of a vote against both proposals. 

        If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or a nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or nominee when voting your shares or when granting
or revoking a proxy. Absent specific instructions from you, your broker is not permitted to vote your shares. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker or nominee does not vote on a
proposal because it does not have discretionary voting power for that proposal and it has not received instructions from the beneficial owner on how to vote on that proposal. LendingTree will count
broker non-votes as present and represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but the bank, broker or nominee will not vote those shares on any proposal
submitted to stockholders. As a result, a broker non-vote on either the proposal to approve the charter amendment or the merger agreement will have the same effect as a vote against the
proposal. 

        If
you are a holder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


written
notice to the Secretary of LendingTree at 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277 that you wish to revoke your proxy;


timely
submission of a subsequently dated proxy card; or


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting. 

        Your
attendance at the special meeting will not by itself revoke your proxy. 

        LendingTree
is not aware of any business to be acted on at the special meeting, except as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. If any other matters are properly presented at the
special meeting, or any adjournment of the special meeting, the persons appointed as proxies or their substitutes will have discretion to vote or act on the matter according to their best judgment and
applicable law. 

Stockholder Proposals  

        LendingTree's bylaws limit the business that may be transacted at a special meeting of stockholders to matters relating to the purposes of the meeting stated in
the notice of the meeting. Accordingly, stockholders may not submit other proposals for consideration at the special meeting. 

        LendingTree
will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders in 2004 only if the merger is not completed. If LendingTree holds an annual meeting and a stockholder wants the board of
directors to consider including such stockholder's proposal in LendingTree's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting, LendingTree must receive the stockholder proposal at LendingTree's
principal executive offices no later than November 17, 2003. In order for a stockholder proposal to be considered for submission at next year's annual meeting, in accordance with the advance
notice requirement of LendingTree's bylaws, LendingTree must receive such proposal at its executive offices no later than January 25, 2004. If LendingTree receives notice of a stockholder
proposal after this date, the proposal will be considered untimely and the persons named in the proxy statement and the form of proxy for 

the
2004 annual meeting of stockholders will have discretionary authority to vote on such proposal without discussion of the matter in the proxy statement and without such proposal appearing as a
separate item on the proxy card. However, if next year's annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after April 23, 2004, a proposal will be considered
untimely if not received by the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting is mailed to stockholders or is publicly announced, whichever is
earlier. 

Persons Making the Solicitation  

        The proxies of the stockholders of LendingTree are being solicited by LendingTree's board of directors. LendingTree will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies
and will share equally with USA the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus. LendingTree will also request banks, brokers and other nominees of
shares of LendingTree's common stock beneficially owned by others to send this proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will, upon request, reimburse the
holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. In addition to this solicitation by mail, officers and regular employees of LendingTree may solicit proxies in person or by mail, telephone,
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission. We will not pay any additional compensation to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation efforts. 

        LendingTree
has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to distribute proxy solicitation materials to brokers, banks and other nominees and to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
LendingTree stockholders. The fee for such firm's service is estimated not to exceed $10,000 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. 

LendingTree stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with their proxy cards.
 LendingTree common stockholders and LendingTree
preferred stockholders will receive a transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of their LendingTree stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Voting Securities and Principal Holders Thereof  

        Information regarding the security ownership of LendingTree's directors and executive officers and persons known to LendingTree to own more than 5% of the
outstanding LendingTree common stock or the outstanding LendingTree preferred stock is incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference to LendingTree's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, which in turn incorporates the information under the heading "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management"
contained in LendingTree's proxy statement for its 2003 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on March 14, 2003. 

Voting Agreements  

        At the time we entered into the merger agreement, USA entered into voting agreements with each of the following parties: Douglas R. Lebda, Tara G. Lebda and the
Douglas R. Lebda Grantor Annuity Trust, a North Carolina trust; Specialty Finance Partners, a Bermuda general partnership, and Capital Z Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; and
Fidelity National Title Company, a California corporation, Chicago Title Insurance Company, a Missouri corporation, Chicago Title Insurance Company of Oregon, an Oregon corporation, and Fidelity
National Title Insurance Company, a California corporation. Together, the shares subject to these voting agreements represent as of the record date approximately [71.8]% of
LendingTree's outstanding preferred stock and approximately [31.2]% of the combined total voting power of LendingTree's outstanding common stock and preferred stock, voting
together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis. 

        Pursuant
to these voting agreements, each stockholder of LendingTree who is a party to a voting agreement has agreed to be present in person or by proxy and vote (or cause to be voted),
and has granted to USA an irrevocable proxy to vote, all of the LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock beneficially owned by that stockholder, together with any shares of LendingTree
common stock, LendingTree preferred stock or other LendingTree voting securities acquired after the date of the voting agreement in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as in favor of the proposal to approve the charter amendment, including, in the case of the LendingTree preferred stock, voting both as a separate class
and together with the LendingTree common stock as a single class. The LendingTree stockholders who are parties to these voting agreements have also agreed to vote their shares against any unsolicited
bona fide written offer or proposal to acquire more than 25% of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries, or capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries representing
more than 15% of the total voting power of all of such entity's voting securities. The LendingTree stockholders who are parties to these voting agreements have also agreed to vote against any action
or agreement that would impair the ability of LendingTree to consummate the merger or that would otherwise prevent or delay the merger and related transactions, and have pledged not to enter into any
other arrangements with respect to disposition of their LendingTree shares. Each of these voting
agreements will terminate automatically upon a termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms (see "The Merger AgreementTermination of the Merger Agreement; Effects of
Termination"), and will also be deemed satisfied in full and terminated upon the completion of the merger. 

THE CHARTER AMENDMENT    

        At the LendingTree special meeting, LendingTree stockholders will consider and vote upon a proposal to amend the certificate of designations of the LendingTree
preferred stock forming a part of LendingTree's certificate of incorporation. Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus contains the form of charter amendment upon which LendingTree's
stockholders will vote. The following description of certain terms of the certificate of designations of the LendingTree preferred stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the certificate of designations of the LendingTree preferred stock, which forms a part of the certificate of incorporation of LendingTree. See "Where You Can Find More
Information." 

        The
certificate of designations of the LendingTree preferred stock that is part of the certificate of incorporation of LendingTree currently provides that in connection with a merger of
LendingTree with any other entity, at the option of each holder of shares of LendingTree preferred stock: 


the
merger will be treated as a liquidation event in which the holder will receive, upon completion of the merger, an amount equal to the greater of (1) the
liquidation preference of such LendingTree preferred shares (equal to $[4.04] per share of preferred stock as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus) or (2) the
consideration that would have been payable in the merger had such LendingTree preferred shares been converted into shares of LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger;


the
conversion price of the LendingTree preferred shares will be adjusted so that upon completion of the merger (1) the holder will have the right to convert its
shares of LendingTree preferred stock, on the terms and conditions specified in the LendingTree preferred stock certificate of designations, into the consideration that the holder would have been
entitled to receive in the merger had the LendingTree preferred shares been converted into shares of LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger, and (2) appropriate provisions will
be made so that the terms and conditions of the LendingTree preferred stock certificate of designations are applicable as nearly as
practicable in relation to any securities or assets delivered upon the conversion of the LendingTree preferred stock; or


to
the extent not treated under either of the above options, at the holder's election, the shares of LendingTree preferred stock will be repurchased by LendingTree or the
surviving corporation following the merger for an amount in cash equal to the then-current liquidation preference of the shares of such LendingTree preferred stock. 

        The
proposed charter amendment provides for the treatment of the LendingTree preferred stock in the merger as described under "The Merger AgreementTreatment of Securities in
the Merger," and eliminates a separate class vote by the holders of LendingTree preferred stock on the merger agreement. The effectiveness of the charter amendment by the filing by LendingTree of a
certificate of amendment to LendingTree's certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State is a condition to USA's and LendingTree's obligations to complete the merger. 

THE MERGER    

        This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes certain aspects of the merger agreement and the proposed merger. The following description does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by
reference. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety. 

Background to the Merger  

        Founded in 1996, LendingTree became a public company in February 2000, when the company sold approximately 21% of its common equity in an initial public
offering. Certain private investors in LendingTree, including Specialty Finance Partners (an affiliate of Capital Z Partners), remained significant stockholders in LendingTree subsequent to the
initial public offering, as did the company's founder and chief executive officer, Douglas R. Lebda. 

        From
time to time beginning in the summer of 2002, members of management of USA and LendingTree spoke informally regarding their companies and opportunities in their particular lines of
business. In late December 2002, members of USA's senior management met with members of LendingTree's senior management at LendingTree's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina to
explore generally the potential merits of the two companies engaging in business transactions with each other. 

        In
early February 2003, LendingTree's chief executive officer and members of USA senior management met in New York City. At the meeting, USA's representatives expressed USA's
interest in pursuing a possible business combination transaction with LendingTree at a valuation for LendingTree's equity of approximately $500 to $600 million. USA's representatives indicated
that the consideration in any such transaction could consist of either shares of USA common stock or a combination of shares of USA common stock and contingent value rights that would potentially
entitle the holders to receive additional consideration following the closing depending upon the trading price of USA's common stock at a future date. Following this meeting, LendingTree engaged
Merrill Lynch to assist it in the discussions with USA as well as to assist in evaluating LendingTree's alternatives. Merrill Lynch was familiar with LendingTree's business and operations because it
had been the lead underwriter for LendingTree's initial public offering in February 2000 and had also provided LendingTree with other financial advisory services from time to time in the past. 

        Following
USA's initial expression of interest in pursuing a business combination transaction, representatives of LendingTree contacted certain third parties that it believed would be
interested in pursuing an acquisition transaction or other strategic transaction to assess their current interest in a transaction. 

        At
a meeting of LendingTree's board of directors on February 12, 2003, LendingTree's chief executive officer advised the board of the status of the discussions with USA. At this
meeting, representatives of Merrill Lynch provided the board of directors with preliminary information regarding potential valuation ranges for LendingTree as well as information regarding USA and its
various lines of business. The board of directors also reviewed with LendingTree senior management and Merrill Lynch other potential acquirers as well as the status of recent discussions with certain
third parties that had previously expressed an interest in a possible acquisition of LendingTree. 

        During
mid and late February 2003, LendingTree's senior management reviewed and updated LendingTree's long-term plan. During this period, LendingTree's board of
directors reviewed the plan and LendingTree's long-term prospects with senior management and further discussed with Merrill Lynch potential valuation ranges for LendingTree as well as a
variety of information and analyses relating to USA and its various lines of business. 

        In
early March 2003, LendingTree preliminarily concluded that a transaction with USA presented a potentially attractive opportunity that LendingTree should further explore.
Representatives of 

LendingTree
informed USA that LendingTree was prepared to enter into more formal discussions with USA regarding a possible transaction involving the two companies. On March 4, 2003, USA and
LendingTree entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement. 

        On
March 5, 2003, LendingTree senior management participated with representatives of Merrill Lynch in presenting an overview of LendingTree's business to members of USA's
management at USA's corporate headquarters in New York, New York. On March 11, 2003, representatives of Merrill Lynch discussed with representatives of USA their analyses and views regarding
the valuation of LendingTree. 

        Also
during early March 2003, LendingTree's senior management continued to review with the board of directors LendingTree's long-range plan and the related
assumptions, as well as the risks in those analyses. 

        Beginning
on March 7, 2003, members of USA management discussed potential transaction structures and valuation ranges with LendingTree's chief executive officer and
representatives of Merrill Lynch. On March 11, 2003, LendingTree's board of directors met to discuss the status of discussions with USA and other third parties. At this meeting, Merrill Lynch
discussed its analyses with the board regarding an appropriate valuation range for LendingTree, and the board discussed LendingTree's long-range plan with senior management and Merrill
Lynch. 

        On
March 13, 2003, USA delivered to LendingTree and Merrill Lynch two preliminary alternative proposals to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Lending Tree, one of
which was for a fixed number of shares of USA common stock and the other of which was for a combination of a fixed number of shares of USA common stock and contingent value rights that would entitle
the holder to additional consideration if USA's common stock was not trading at or above a specified price 18 months following the closing. The proposed contingent value right was structured to
provide total consideration in exchange for all outstanding equity interests in LendingTree, measured on the 18-month anniversary of the closing, of approximately $600 million so
long as USA's common stock were to be trading in a specified range at such time. That same evening, representatives of LendingTree informed USA that the board of directors of LendingTree had reviewed
USA's proposals and had found both proposals inadequate. 

        LendingTree's
senior management and representatives of Merrill Lynch also had discussions with certain third parties during the first half of March regarding their interest in a possible
strategic transaction with LendingTree. One of the companies that Merrill Lynch had contacted entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with LendingTree. These discussions
ultimately resulted in one party tentatively proposing a transaction with a valuation of LendingTree that was less
than the implied valuation of the early March USA proposal. Another third party indicated that, while it was not presently interested in a transaction, it might be interested in pursuing a transaction
in the future. 

        Between
March 14 and April 16, 2003, USA's management had a number of further discussions with LendingTree's chief executive officer and representatives of Merrill Lynch
regarding possible alternative transaction structures and terms, which generally involved a combination of shares of USA common stock and contingent value rights. These discussions resulted in the
delivery to Lending Tree on April 16, 2003 of a revised proposal by USA to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of LendingTree for a combination of shares of USA common stock and
contingent value rights. The proposed contingent value right had an 18-month maturity and was structured to provide total consideration in exchange for all outstanding equity interests in
LendingTree, measured on the 18-month anniversary of the closing, of approximately $629.4 million so long as USA's common stock were to be trading in the range of $20.00 to $37.02
at such time. 

        LendingTree's
board of directors met on April 16, 2003 to discuss USA's revised proposal as well as the status of USA's recently announced transactions involving Expedia and
Hotels.com. Because of the improved valuation reflected in USA's revised proposal, representatives of Merrill Lynch informed USA that LendingTree's board of directors was willing to continue to
discuss a potential transaction 

with
USA and to proceed toward definitive transaction documents generally on the basis of USA's revised proposal. 

        On
April 19, 2003, LendingTree engaged Allen & Company as a second financial advisor to assist it in evaluating a possible business combination with USA and entered into a formal
engagement letter to that effect on April 28, 2003. The LendingTree board decided to engage Allen & Company because Allen & Company had in the past provided financial advisory
services to LendingTree, and the board believed Allen & Company's particular familiarity with USA would aid the LendingTree board in its evaluation of USA's businesses and the value of any
merger consideration payable in USA securities. In deciding to engage Allen & Company, LendingTree's board of directors was aware of and considered Allen & Company's existing
relationships with USA. See "Opinion of LendingTree's Financial AdvisorsOpinion of Allen & Company LLC." 

        On
April 22, 2003, USA's outside legal counsel delivered a draft merger agreement to LendingTree and its outside legal counsel. On April 23 and 24, 2003, USA management,
together with USA's outside legal and financial advisors, continued their due diligence investigation of LendingTree in Charlotte, North Carolina. Also in late April 2003, USA retained J.P.
Morgan Securities as its financial advisor. 

        On
April 23, 2003, following LendingTree's annual meeting of stockholders, LendingTree's board of directors met to discuss further the terms of USA's proposal and LendingTree's
long-term business plan. In addition, on that date, LendingTree's board met with its outside legal counsel to discuss USA's latest proposal, including the economic terms and proposed
structure of the transaction, the proposed treatment of the LendingTree preferred stock in the transaction and considerations relating to the contingent value rights. At that meeting, LendingTree's
chief executive officer informed the other members of the board that he had received a preliminary proposal from USA regarding a management incentive plan for LendingTree officers that USA would
implement following the consummation of the transaction, as well as the preliminary terms of employment agreements to be entered into between USA and senior executives of LendingTree effective upon
closing of the transaction. 

        Members
of USA's senior management met with and made presentations to the board of directors of LendingTree on April 25, 2003 at USA's corporate headquarters in New York, New
York. In addition, LendingTree and its legal and financial advisors continued their financial and legal due diligence investigation of USA. 

        On
April 25, 2003, LendingTree's chief executive officer and a member of LendingTree's board contacted a representative of Fidelity National Financial, a significant LendingTree
stockholder, and informed him generally about the potential transaction with USA and that USA would require Fidelity to enter into a voting agreement. That same day, Fidelity executed a
confidentiality agreement with LendingTree so that Fidelity could receive more information about the potential transaction. Shortly thereafter, representatives of USA contacted Fidelity to discuss the
importance to USA of the requested voting agreement. 

        On
April 26, 2003, USA's outside legal counsel delivered to LendingTree and its legal counsel a draft form of the voting agreement to be entered into between USA and certain
principal stockholders of LendingTree, which USA had indicated was a condition to USA's willingness to proceed with the proposed transaction. 

        On
April 27, 2003, LendingTree's board of directors met with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors to discuss Allen & Company's views regarding an appropriate
valuation range for LendingTree, as well as to discuss USA and its businesses. The board of directors also received reports on the status of the various transaction documents at this meeting. 

        From
April 26, 2003 until the announcement of the transaction on May 5, 2003, negotiations continued between USA and LendingTree and their respective advisors regarding the
terms of the proposed transaction, the merger agreement and related transaction agreements, including the proposed amendment of the certificate of designations of LendingTree's preferred stock. Two 

non-employee
members of LendingTree's board of directors were actively involved in these discussions and negotiations. During this period, USA and LendingTree agreed to change the form of
merger consideration from a combination of USA common stock and contingent value rights to a fixed number of shares of USA common stock, with the consideration for the LendingTree common stock based
on a fixed exchange ratio and the consideration for the LendingTree preferred stock based on the same exchange ratio applied to the number of LendingTree common shares that the holder would have
received had it converted the preferred shares into common shares immediately before the merger. In evaluating this change in the form of the merger consideration, the LendingTree board of directors
considered the advantages and risks associated with each type of consideration relative to fluctuations in USA's stock price, and the tax consequences and complexity of each form of consideration, and
determined that the greater upside potential, tax-free nature and simplicity of the stock-only consideration made it more favorable for LendingTree's stockholders. 

        Also
during this period from April 26 until May 5, 2003, the parties continued their due diligence investigations and negotiations continued among the parties and their
advisors regarding the terms of the voting agreements between USA and certain principal stockholders of LendingTree. In addition, during this period, members of LendingTree's board from time to time
conferred among themselves and with LendingTree's legal and financial advisors to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction and to provide guidance to LendingTree's legal and financial advisors
regarding the matters being negotiated. 

        Late
in the week of April 28, 2003, after USA and LendingTree had made significant progress on the terms of the proposed transaction, LendingTree's chief executive officer began
to negotiate the terms of the post-transaction management incentive arrangements, including the terms of the new employment agreements and a Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders'
Agreement to be entered into by certain members of LendingTree senior management, each to be effective upon the closing of the proposed merger. Representatives of one of LendingTree's outside legal
advisors participated in these management compensation negotiations, and the LendingTree board of directors received periodic updates on the status of the discussions. During this period,
representatives of USA and representatives of the stockholders that entered into voting agreements continued to discuss and negotiate the terms of the voting agreements. 

        On
May 1, 2003, the USA board of directors met and, after hearing presentations from USA management and USA's legal advisors, approved the proposed transaction in principle,
delegating final approval of the definitive transaction terms and agreements to the executive committee of the board. 

        During
the afternoon of May 4, 2003, LendingTree's board of directors met to consider the proposed transaction. At the meeting, LendingTree's management and its legal and
financial advisors made presentations to the board concerning the proposed merger and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, as well as the terms of the contemplated amendment to
certificate of designations of the LendingTree preferred stock, including the treatment of the LendingTree preferred stock in the transaction, the proposed voting agreements between USA and certain
principal stockholders of the company and the proposed terms of new employment agreements and equity arrangements to be entered into by USA with certain members of LendingTree's senior management.
Merrill Lynch and Allen & Company each delivered an oral opinion to the LendingTree board of directors as to the fairness of the exchange ratio under the merger agreement. The LendingTree board
of directors discussed the matters presented by management and by the company's legal and financial advisors, including the factors discussed under "LendingTree's Reasons for the Merger."
After discussion, the LendingTree board of directors unanimously approved the draft merger agreement and other transaction agreements, the charter amendment and other related matters, subject to
finalization by LendingTree's management and its legal advisors. 

        Also
during the afternoon of May 4, 2003, the executive committee of USA's board of directors convened to consider the proposed transaction. At the meeting, USA's management and
legal and 

financial
advisors made presentations to the USA executive committee concerning the proposed merger and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the proposed charter amendment, as
well as the terms of the voting agreements to be entered into between USA and certain principal stockholders of LendingTree and the new employment agreements and Restricted Share Grant and
Shareholders' Agreement to be entered into with certain members of LendingTree senior management. After discussion, the USA executive committee unanimously approved the merger agreement and related
transaction agreements, subject to finalization by USA's management and its legal advisors. 

        On
the evening of May 4, 2003, representatives of LendingTree's and USA's management and legal advisors completed the definitive merger agreement and related transaction
agreements. During this same evening, the voting agreements to be entered into between USA and certain principal stockholders of LendingTree were also finalized. 

        The
LendingTree board of directors reconvened on the morning of May 5, 2003 prior to the opening of the market to receive a final update on the definitive transaction agreements
as well as the oral opinions of LendingTree's financial advisors, which were subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of that date, and based on the considerations in their respective
opinions, the exchange ratio pursuant to the proposed merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. Following
further discussion, the board of directors of LendingTree unanimously reconfirmed its approval of the merger agreement and the charter amendment, authorized the execution of the merger agreement with
USA and directed that the merger agreement and the charter amendment be submitted to the stockholders of LendingTree along with the LendingTree board of directors' unanimous recommendation that the
LendingTree stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement and the charter amendment. 

        Following
the meeting of LendingTree's board of directors on May 5, 2003, LendingTree and Wachovia Bank N.A. executed an amendment to LendingTree's stockholder rights agreement.
Thereafter, LendingTree and USA executed the merger agreement. In addition, Mr. Lebda and Mr. Reddin entered into the new employment agreements and the Restricted Share Grant and
Shareholders' Agreement with USA and its merger subsidiary, and Mr. Lebda, Specialty Finance Partners and Fidelity, as well as certain of their affiliates, entered into voting agreements with
USA. Thereafter, USA and LendingTree issued a joint press release announcing the transaction and held a joint press conference later that morning. 

Recommendation of the LendingTree Board of Directors  

        On May 5, 2003, LendingTree's board of directors unanimously: 


determined
that the terms and provisions of the merger agreement were fair to, and in the best interests of, LendingTree and its common and preferred stockholders;


approved
the merger agreement;


approved
the charter amendment; and


directed
that the merger agreement and the charter amendment be submitted to LendingTree's stockholders for their consideration and approval. 

        The
board of directors of LendingTree unanimously recommends that stockholders vote at the special meeting 
"FOR"
 approval of the charter
amendment and 
"FOR"
 approval of the merger agreement. 

LendingTree's Reasons for the Merger  

        In reaching its decision to approve the charter amendment and the merger agreement and recommend that LendingTree's stockholders vote to approve the charter
amendment and the merger agreement, LendingTree's board of directors consulted with its financial advisors and legal counsel, as 

well
as with LendingTree's management, and carefully considered a number of factors and potential benefits, including the following: 


the
financial terms and structure of the merger, including the relationship of the exchange ratio of 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock for each share of LendingTree
common stock to recent and historical market prices of LendingTree common stock as well as its relationship to the recent and historical ratio of the LendingTree common stock market price to the USA
common stock market price. In this respect, the board of directors noted that based on the closing price of USA common stock on May 2, 2003, the last trading day prior to announcement of the
merger agreement, the value of the merger consideration per share of LendingTree common stock equaled $21.67, which implied a premium of:


47.5%
over the closing price of LendingTree common stock on May 2, 2003;


72.5%
over the average closing prices of LendingTree common stock during the 30 day period ending on May 2, 2003; and


85.9%
over the average closing prices of LendingTree common stock during the 60 day period ending on May 2, 2003;


current
and historical market prices of LendingTree common stock relative to other industry participants and general market and sector indices;


USA's
business diversification relative to LendingTree, and the fact that USA common stock has a larger public float and trading volume and is more liquid than LendingTree
common stock;


the
financial condition, results of operations, earnings and businesses of LendingTree and USA and current industry, economic, political and market conditions;


the
presentations and opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to the board of directors that, as of May 5, 2003, and subject to and based
upon the assumptions and other considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.6199 pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock;


the
presentations and opinion of Allen & Company to the board of directors that, as of May 5, 2003, and subject to and based upon the assumptions and other
considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.6199 pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of LendingTree common stock and
LendingTree preferred stock;


the
efforts of Merrill Lynch and LendingTree's management to maintain active dialogues with other entities that might have considered a business combination transaction with
LendingTree, the results of those discussions and the likelihood of receiving a superior proposal;


the
trading history of LendingTree common stock and USA common stock, and the business and investment community reputation of Mr. Diller;


the
fact that the receipt of USA common stock by the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock in the merger is expected to be tax-free
to such holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except in respect of cash received instead of a fractional share of USA common stock, and that the merger is expected to be tax-free
for U.S. federal income tax purposes to USA and LendingTree;


the
complementary businesses of USA and LendingTree, the potential prospects and businesses of the combined company following the merger and the ability of LendingTree
common stockholders and LendingTree preferred stockholders to continue to participate in any growth of the businesses conducted by USA and LendingTree after the merger; 


the
terms of the merger agreement, including that the merger agreement permits:


LendingTree,
prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of the charter amendment and the merger agreement, to provide information and enter into negotiations with a third
party if LendingTree receives a bona fide written unsolicited proposal from a third party if the board determines in good faith that (1) the proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a
transaction that is more favorable to LendingTree's stockholders than the USA merger, and (2) the failure by the board to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the board;


the
board of directors to withdraw its recommendation to the LendingTree stockholders to approve the merger agreement if it determines that continuing to make such
recommendation would cause the members of the board of directors to breach their fiduciary duties; and


LendingTree,
prior to the receipt of LendingTree stockholder approval of the charter amendment and the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement to accept a
proposal for an acquisition transaction that would result in a transaction more favorable to LendingTree's stockholders than the USA merger if it has negotiated with USA (if USA so requests) without
having obtained terms from USA at least as favorable as the competing proposal, if the board of directors resolves that the failure to accept such proposal would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties and if LendingTree pays USA a termination fee of $25 million;


the
judgment, advice and analyses of LendingTree's management with respect to the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the merger, including
management's favorable recommendation of the merger;


the
terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price and structure, which were considered by both LendingTree's board of directors and LendingTree's
management to provide a fair and equitable basis for the merger;


the
rights and interests of the holders of LendingTree preferred stock and that, even though USA's proposed merger structure would require the preferred stock to be treated
as if it had been converted into LendingTree common stock immediately before the effective time of the merger, such holders would receive merger consideration valued significantly higher than the
liquidation preference of the LendingTree preferred stock;


whether
the transaction with USA offered greater value to LendingTree's common stockholders and preferred stockholders than other alternatives available to LendingTree,
including LendingTree continuing as an independent company; and


the
review of, and discussions with, the board of directors' legal and financial advisors and LendingTree's senior management regarding certain business, financial, legal
and accounting aspects of the merger, and the results of legal and financial due diligence. 

        LendingTree's
board of directors also considered and, as appropriate, balanced against the potential benefits of the merger a number of neutral and potentially negative factors,
including the following: 


the
possibility that the merger might not be completed because a condition to closing might not be satisfied;


the
significant costs, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and financial printing fees, that will be incurred in seeking to consummate the merger;


the
restrictions on LendingTree's businesses prior to the closing or termination of the merger agreement and the potential time frame that the company might be subject to
those restrictions; 


the
risk of diverting management and employee resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;


the
terms of the voting agreements between USA and certain of LendingTree's principal stockholders (as of the date of the merger agreement holding approximately 70.0% of
LendingTree's outstanding preferred stock and approximately 31.5% of the combined total voting power of LendingTree's outstanding common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class
with the LendingTree preferred stock voting on an as-converted basis) under which each of these stockholders has agreed to vote the shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock held by such holder in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the charter amendment at the LendingTree special meeting of stockholders;


the
possibility that, notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement allowing LendingTree, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct
discussions with a third party and terminate the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal for a business combination or acquisition of the company, the termination fee payable upon such
a termination might discourage other parties who might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of, LendingTree;


the
circumstances under which LendingTree would have to pay the termination fee and the financial impact on LendingTree if it had to pay the termination fee;


the
possibility that the common stockholders and preferred stockholders of LendingTree will not receive the full benefit of any future growth in the value of their equity
that LendingTree may have achieved as an independent public company, and the possibility that USA will not perform as well in the future as LendingTree might have performed as a public company without
consummating the merger;


the
impact of the merger on LendingTree's employees;


that
the value of the merger consideration is determined by a fixed exchange ratio, and the possibility that the market value of USA common stock might decrease, resulting
in less aggregate value being paid to LendingTree's stockholders;


the
interests of certain executive officers and directors of LendingTree with respect to the merger, described under "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger," in
addition to their interests as stockholders of LendingTree generally; and


other
matters described under "Risk Factors." 

        After
detailed consideration of these factors, the LendingTree board of directors determined that the merger was fair to, and in the best interests of, LendingTree and its stockholders. 

        The
above discussion of the information and factors considered by the LendingTree board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the
LendingTree board of directors. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, LendingTree's board of directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise did not find it
practicable to assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. The determination was made after consideration of all the factors, both positive and negative,
taken as a whole. In addition, individual members of the LendingTree board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. 

Opinions of LendingTree's Financial Advisors  

 Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated  

        LendingTree retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, or Merrill Lynch, to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with the
proposed merger. As part of the engagement, LendingTree requested that Merrill Lynch deliver an opinion as to whether the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of the LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. At the meeting of the LendingTree board of directors on May 4, 2003, Merrill Lynch made a presentation of certain
financial analyses of the merger, as summarized below. At a meeting of the LendingTree board of directors held on May 5, 2003, Merrill Lynch rendered its oral opinion to the LendingTree board
of directors (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the exchange
ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of the LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. 

        The
full text of the opinion of Merrill Lynch, dated May 5, 2003, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations of the review undertaken by Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion, is attached as Appendix C to this document and is incorporated into this document by
reference. The summary of the Merrill Lynch fairness opinion set forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Holders of LendingTree common stock
and LendingTree preferred stock are urged to read the entire opinion carefully. The Merrill Lynch opinion was prepared for, and is addressed to, LendingTree's board of directors and is directed to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. The Merrill Lynch opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of LendingTree common stock or
LendingTree preferred stock as to how any such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter. 

        In
connection with rendering its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things: 


reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information relating to LendingTree and USA that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


reviewed
certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the businesses, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of LendingTree and USA,
furnished to Merrill Lynch by LendingTree and USA, respectively;


conducted
discussions with members of the senior management of LendingTree and USA concerning the matters described in the preceding two bullet points, as well as their
respective businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the proposed merger;


reviewed
the historical market prices and valuation multiples for LendingTree common stock and USA common stock and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


reviewed
the results of operations of LendingTree and USA;


compared
the proposed financial terms of the proposed merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


participated
in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of LendingTree and USA and their financial and legal advisors with respect to the proposed merger;


reviewed
a draft of the merger agreement and one draft form of the voting agreement, each dated May 3, 2003; and 


reviewed
such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including Merrill Lynch's assessment of
general economic, market and monetary conditions. 

        In
preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it, discussed with or reviewed by
or for it, or that was publicly available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such information or undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal of any
of the assets or liabilities of LendingTree or USA, nor was Merrill Lynch furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct, nor did
it conduct, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of LendingTree or USA. With respect to the financial and operating information, including, without limitation, financial forecasts,
valuations of contingencies and future economic conditions furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by LendingTree or USA, Merrill Lynch assumed that all this information had been reasonably
prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of LendingTree or USA as to the future financial and operating performance of LendingTree or USA,
as the case may be. Merrill Lynch further assumed that the proposed merger would generally qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Merrill Lynch also
assumed that the final form of the merger agreement and voting agreements would be substantially similar to the last drafts that it reviewed. 

        Merrill
Lynch's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and on the information made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its
opinion. Merrill Lynch assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the proposed merger, no restrictions, including
any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of LendingTree or USA
or on the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger. 

        The
Merrill Lynch opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by LendingTree to engage in the proposed merger and Merrill Lynch does not express any opinion as to the
prices at which the shares of LendingTree common stock or USA common stock will trade following the announcement or consummation of the proposed merger. In addition, LendingTree's board of directors
did not ask Merrill Lynch to address, and its opinion did not address, (1) the fairness to, or any other consideration of, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
LendingTree, other than the holders of the LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock or (2) the fairness of any other terms or provisions applicable to the LendingTree preferred
stock, whether before or after giving effect to the proposed charter amendment. For purposes of its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed that all shares of LendingTree preferred stock would be converted
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger into LendingTree common stock at the conversion rate provided by LendingTree to Merrill Lynch, as set forth in the certificate of designations for
the LendingTree preferred stock. 

 May 4, 2003 Presentation by Merrill Lynch  

        At the May 4, 2003 meeting of the LendingTree board of directors, and in connection with preparing its opinion for the board, Merrill Lynch made a
presentation of certain financial analyses of the proposed merger. 

        The
following is a summary of the material analyses contained in the presentation that was delivered to LendingTree's board of directors. Some of the summaries of financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses performed by Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the accompanying text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses, including the 

methodologies
and assumptions underlying the analyses, and if viewed in isolation could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Merrill Lynch. 

 Exchange Ratio Analysis  

        Merrill Lynch compared an assumed purchase price of $21.67 per share of LendingTree common stock to (1) the closing price of LendingTree common stock on
May 2, 2003, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the proposed transaction, and (2) the average closing prices of LendingTree common stock during the 30 and 60 day
periods ending on May 2, 2003. The assumed purchase price of $21.67 is based upon an exchange ratio of 0.6199 (the exchange ratio in the proposed transaction) and USA's closing stock price of
$34.96 on May 2, 2003. Merrill Lynch also calculated the per-share price implied by the exchange ratio as a multiple of LendingTree's estimated earnings per share (which Merrill
Lynch refers to as EPS), and estimated per-share earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which Merrill Lynch refers to as EBITDA).

Number
of shares of LendingTree common stock estimated to be outstanding at time that the proposed merger is completed, as provided to Merrill Lynch by LendingTree senior management,
calculated on a fully-diluted basis assuming a USA share price of $34.96 for net treasury purposes.

(3)
LendingTree's
senior management provided Merrill Lynch with estimates of its year 2003 and year 2004 earnings per share and EBITDA per share. See "Certain LendingTree Financial
Projections." 

        Merrill
Lynch also reviewed the historical closing prices of LendingTree common stock and USA common stock for the twelve-month period ending on May 2, 2003. Using this data,
Merrill Lynch calculated the historical exchange ratio, by dividing the closing prices of LendingTree common stock by the closing prices of USA common stock during that twelve-month period, yielding
an implied exchange ratio assuming no premium was paid on the LendingTree common stock. The average implied exchange ratio over this period was 0.5322. Merrill Lynch also calculated the implied
exchange ratio as of May 2, 2003, which was 0.4202, based on the relative closing prices of LendingTree common stock and USA common stock on that date. 

 Premium Analysis  

        Merrill Lynch calculated the premium represented by a purchase price of $21.67 per share of LendingTree common stock, relative to the historical prices of
LendingTree common stock, as summarized in the following table:

Assumed
purchase price of $21.67 is based upon an exchange ratio of 0.6199 (the exchange ratio in the proposed transaction) and USA's closing stock price of $34.96 on May 2,
2003. 

        Merrill
Lynch then compared the implied premium represented by the exchange ratio with the premiums paid in other acquisitions in general, and in Internet-only acquisitions
in particular, in each case, based on transactions announced from the beginning of the second quarter of 2000 through Friday, May 2, 2003. Merrill Lynch reviewed the average of those premiums
relative to closing prices of acquired entities (1) one day prior to public announcement of the transaction, (2) one week prior to public announcement and (3) four weeks prior to
public announcement. Merrill Lynch reviewed that data both on a per-quarter basis as well as an average over the entire period presented. Merrill Lynch then compared those averages with
the implied premium represented by the exchange ratio. Below is a summary presentation of those comparisons, with the averages calculated over the entire period.

        Merrill
Lynch used publicly available financial information and publicly available equity research to determine for each comparable company, among other matters, (1) enterprise
value relative to year 2003 and year 2004 estimated EBITDA, and (2) stock prices relative to year 2003 and year 2004 estimated earnings per share. For the purposes of this analysis, Merrill
Lynch used the closing prices per share of common stock on May 2, 2003 as the applicable closing stock price for each comparable company and for LendingTree and USA. Merrill Lynch calculated
the enterprise value of each comparable company and of LendingTree and USA as the fully diluted market value of common stock as of May 2, 2003 plus long-term debt (including
short-term maturities of long-term debt), minority interest and preferred stock, less cash and cash equivalents (treating marketable securities as cash 

equivalents).
LendingTree's senior management provided Merrill Lynch with estimates of its year 2003 and year 2004 earnings per share and EBITDA.

LendingTree's
senior management provided Merrill Lynch with estimates of its year 2003 and year 2004 EBITDA. See "Certain LendingTree Financial Projections." The estimates of year
2003 EBITDA and year 2004 EBITDA for all comparable companies was obtained from Merrill Lynch research (if available) or otherwise from estimates of research analysts at other firms.

LendingTree's
senior management provided Merrill Lynch with estimates of its year 2003 and year 2004 earnings per share. See "Certain LendingTree Financial Projections." The consensus
estimates of First Call as of May 2, 2003 was the source for EPS data for all comparable companies. 

        Merrill
Lynch applied each of the multiples for the comparable companies to comparable data for LendingTree. Using the resulting mean and median values, Merrill Lynch calculated a range
of implied per-share values of LendingTree common stock as of May 2, 2003. 

        No
comparable company identified above is identical to LendingTree. A complete analysis involves considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values of such comparable companies; mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or the
median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable public company data. 

 Precedent Acquisitions Analysis  

        Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available information supplied by Securities Data Corporation for acquisition transactions that were announced between
May 1, 2001 and May 1, 2003 with an equity value at the time of announcement of $250 million to $1.25 billion, where the target was a U.S. Internet company. 

        For
these acquisition transactions, Merrill Lynch used financial information available from Securities Data Corporation to determine, for each of the acquired businesses, the target's
equity value, as proposed to be paid in such acquisition transaction at the time it was announced, (1) as a multiple of the target's net sales for the twelve months preceding the announcement
of the acquisition, (2) as a multiple of the target's earnings before interest and taxes (which Merrill Lynch refers to as EBIT) for the twelve months preceding the announcement of the
acquisition and (3) as a multiple of the target's net income for the twelve months preceding the announcement of the acquisition. These multiples were available for some, but not all, of these
acquisition transactions. Below is a list of transactions that, according to Securities Data Corporation, met the specified criteria and for which any of the data described in this paragraph was
available:

reported by Securities Data Corporation.

(2)
These
figures are based upon LendingTree's publicly disclosed financial results for the one-year period ended on March 31, 2003, as adjusted to reflect the
assumption that there were 32.8 million shares of LendingTree common stock outstanding during such period. 

        No
selected acquisition transaction identified above is identical to the proposed merger. A complete analysis involves considerations and judgments concerning differences in the selected
acquisition transactions and other factors that could affect the premiums paid in such comparable transactions to which the proposed merger is being compared; mathematical analysis (such as
determining the mean or the median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected acquisition transaction data. 

 Implied Present Value Per Share Analysis  

        Merrill Lynch performed an analysis of the implied per-share present value of LendingTree common stock based on LendingTree management's
per-share EBITDA and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles earnings financial estimates for the years 2003 through 2007. Merrill Lynch calculated a range of discounted values per
share of LendingTree common stock by applying different multiples to LendingTree's estimated per-share earnings and EBITDA in each respective period. In conducting this analysis, Merrill
Lynch used a discount rate of 20%. The discount rate utilized in this analysis was based upon Merrill Lynch's estimate of the equity cost of capital of LendingTree after taking into account the
five-year "betas" of the entities listed under "Comparable Public Company Analysis" above. The "beta" is the covariance of a stock in relation to the rest of the stock market
and is often used as a measure of a stock's relative volatility. The purpose of estimating present value per share was not to attempt to predict prices at which LendingTree common stock would trade.
Rather, the analysis was one of many performed by Merrill Lynch in connection with preparing its opinion. 

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of LendingTree  

        Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of LendingTree as a stand-alone entity based on LendingTree management's U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles earnings-per-share financial estimates for the years 2003 through 2007. Merrill Lynch calculated a range of equity values per share of LendingTree common
stock based upon the sum of the present value of LendingTree's projected stream of after-tax free cash flows through 2007, plus the present value of LendingTree's terminal value based on a
range of multiples of its projected year 2007 estimated net income. In conducting this analysis, Merrill Lynch used discount rates ranging from 15% to 25%, and terminal 

value
multiples of year 2007 estimated net income ranging from 10x to 20x. The discount rates utilized in this analysis were based upon Merrill Lynch's estimate of the equity cost of capital of
LendingTree after taking into account the five-year betas of the entities listed under "Comparable Public Company Analysis" above. 

General Matters  

        In connection with the review of the proposed merger by the LendingTree board of directors, Merrill Lynch performed a variety of financial and comparable analyses
for purposes of rendering its opinion. The above summary of these analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its opinion. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch considered the results of all of its
analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch believes that the summary provided and the analyses described
above must be considered as a whole and that selecting any portion of their analyses, without considering all of them, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and
opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical
purposes and should not be taken to be the view of Merrill Lynch with respect to the actual value of LendingTree, USA or the combined entity. 

        In
performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Merrill Lynch, LendingTree or USA. Any estimates contained in the analyses of Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were prepared solely as part of the analyses of Merrill Lynch of the fairness of the exchange ratio,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock, and were prepared in connection with the delivery by Merrill Lynch of its opinion to the
LendingTree board of directors. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the shares of LendingTree common stock or USA common stock will trade following the
announcement or consummation of the proposed merger. 

        The
exchange ratio and other terms of the proposed merger were determined through arms' length negotiations between LendingTree and USA and were approved by LendingTree's board of
directors. Merrill Lynch provided advice to LendingTree's board of directors during such negotiations. However, Merrill Lynch did not recommend any specific exchange ratio or other form of
consideration to LendingTree's board of directors or that any specific exchange ratio or other form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed merger. The opinion
of Merrill Lynch was one of many factors taken into consideration by LendingTree's board of directors in making its determination to approve the proposed merger. The analyses of Merrill Lynch
summarized above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the LendingTree's board of directors with respect to the value of LendingTree, USA or the combined entity or of whether the
LendingTree's board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio or other forms of consideration. 

        The
LendingTree board of directors selected Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor because of its reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm with
substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed merger and because Merrill Lynch is familiar with LendingTree and its business. As part of its investment banking and financial advisory
business, Merrill Lynch is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. 

        Merrill Lynch provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services. In the past, Merrill Lynch has provided financial advisory and other financing services to LendingTree.
Merrill Lynch has received fees for those services and also may provide such services to LendingTree or USA in the future for which it would expect to receive fees. In the ordinary course of its
business, Merrill Lynch may actively trade LendingTree or USA securities for its own account or for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities. 

        Under
the terms of a separate letter agreement, dated May 2, 2003, LendingTree engaged Merrill Lynch as financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger and requested that
Merrill Lynch render an opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio to the holders of the LendingTree common stock and the LendingTree preferred stock. Pursuant to
its letter agreement with Merrill Lynch, LendingTree agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a customary fee upon consummation of the proposed merger. Under the letter agreement, LendingTree also agreed to
reimburse Merrill Lynch for its reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the engagement and to indemnify Merrill Lynch and related parties for certain liabilities arising out of its engagement. 

 Opinion of Allen & Company LLC  

        The board of directors of LendingTree also received a written fairness opinion, dated May 5, 2003, from Allen & Company LLC to the effect that the
exchange ratio in the proposed merger is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. 

        The
full text of the Allen & Company fairness opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, general procedures followed, matters considered and methods employed by
Allen & Company in arriving at its opinion is attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of the Allen & Company fairness opinion contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. 

        Allen &
Company's written opinion is addressed to LendingTree's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and the proposed merger and does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock should vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Holders of LendingTree
common stock and LendingTree preferred stock are urged to and should read the opinion in its entirety. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company: 


reviewed
trends in the financial services and online commerce industries;


reviewed
the terms and conditions of the merger, including the draft merger agreement and related draft agreements (none of which prior to the delivery of the opinion had
been executed by the parties);


analyzed
certain financial aspects of the merger, including the exchange ratio of 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock for each share of LendingTree common stock, and the
number of shares of USA common stock to be exchanged for each share of LendingTree preferred stock based on that exchange ratio and the formula for converting shares of LendingTree preferred stock
into shares of LendingTree common stock set forth in the certificate of designations of the Lending Tree preferred stock;


reviewed
and analyzed publicly available historical business and financial information relating to LendingTree and USA as presented in documents filed with the SEC;


analyzed
selected summary non-public financial and operating results of operations of LendingTree, including the long range plan for fiscal years 2003 through
2007; 


analyzed
the financial conditions and prospects of LendingTree and USA;


reviewed
and analyzed public information, including certain stock market data and financial information relating to selected companies with businesses which Allen &
Company deemed comparable to those of LendingTree and USA;


reviewed
the trading histories of LendingTree common stock and USA common stock and their relation to those of companies which Allen & Company deemed comparable to
LendingTree and USA;


analyzed
the market multiples of LendingTree and USA and their business segments in relation to certain selected companies which Allen & Company deemed comparable to
LendingTree and USA;


conferred
with the respective management teams of LendingTree and USA;


analyzed
the discounted present value of LendingTree's future cash flows, based on the long range plan for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 of LendingTree's management;


analyzed
the discounted present value of USA's future cash flows, based on USA's publicly released budget for 2003 and certain Wall Street research estimates, as adjusted,
for 2004 through 2008;


reviewed
public financial and transaction information relating to premiums paid in selected mergers which Allen & Company deemed comparable;


reviewed
public financial and transaction information related to selected multiples paid for certain selected companies in selected mergers which Allen & Company
deemed comparable to the merger; and


conducted
such other financial analyses and investigations as Allen & Company deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion. 

        Allen &
Company's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion.
Allen & Company's opinion does not provide or imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range of any security issued by any party following the approval of the merger. This may vary
depending upon, among other factors, changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, general economic conditions and other factors that generally influence the price of securities.
Although Allen & Company evaluated the exchange ratio from a financial point of view, Allen & Company was not requested to, and did not, recommend any specific exchange ratio or other
form of consideration payable in the merger. LendingTree and USA determined the exchange ratio and the other terms of the merger through arms' length negotiations. Allen & Company advised
LendingTree's board of directors during such negotiations. 

        For
purposes of its opinion, Allen & Company assumed that all shares of LendingTree preferred stock had been converted immediately prior to the effective time of the merger into
LendingTree common stock at the conversion rate set forth in the certificate of designations for the LendingTree preferred stock as provided by LendingTree to Allen & Company. Allen &
Company made this assumption because the merger agreement provides that each share of LendingTree preferred stock will be exchanged for the number of shares of USA common stock that the holder would
have received had such LendingTree preferred stock been converted into LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger. 

        As
of the date of the opinion, Allen & Company and its affiliates were stockholders in USA and LendingTree, and Donald R. Keough, Chairman of Allen & Company, also served
as a director of USA and as chair of its audit committee. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business as a broker-dealer and market maker, Allen & Company may have long or short
positions, either on a discretionary 

or
nondiscretionary basis, for its own account or for those of its clients, in the securities of USA and LendingTree. Further, Allen & Company has been engaged by USA (and its predecessors) to
render financial advisory services from time to time in the past on numerous separate transactions for which Allen & Company has received customary fees, and may do so in the future, and
Allen & Company has been engaged by LendingTree to render financial advisory services from time to time in the past for which Allen & Company has received customary fees. It is
contemplated that Allen & Company will be available to provide investment banking and related services to USA in the future on other engagements. 

        The
following is the summary of the material analyses Allen & Company performed while preparing its fairness opinion. 

Analysis of LendingTree  

 Analysis of the Historical Trading Activity of LendingTree Common Stock  

        Allen & Company analyzed the historical price and trading activity of LendingTree common stock. For the twelve months ended May 2, 2003, the price
of LendingTree common stock ranged from $8.40 to $16.25, with an average daily volume of approximately 353,000 shares. For the 90 trading days ended May 2, 2003, the price of LendingTree common
stock ranged from $9.21 to $14.98, with an average daily volume of approximately 389,000 shares. For the ten trading days ended May 2, 2003, the price of LendingTree common stock ranged from
$12.97 to $14.69, with an average daily volume of approximately 856,000 shares. 

        For
the twelve months ended May 2, 2003, the general trading pattern for LendingTree common stock was similar to the trading patterns of companies which Allen & Company
deemed comparable to LendingTree and USA, and the closing price of $14.69 of LendingTree common stock on May 2, 2003 was a representative price for LendingTree common stock in that there was no
evidence to assert that it was not an accurate reflection of the market price for LendingTree common stock on such date. 

 Business Segment Valuation of LendingTree Analysis  

        Allen & Company performed a valuation analysis on the two main business segments of LendingTree, its lending exchange, or lending, business and its realty
services, or realty, business. For the lending business segment, Allen & Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing LendingTree management's budgeted and projected financial
results for the fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Using this information, Allen & Company discounted to present value the projected stream of after-tax free cash flows (unlevered net
income plus non-cash charges less capital expenditures and working capital changes) at discount rates ranging from 18.9% to 23.3%. Allen & Company also calculated a terminal value
for the lending business segment by applying multiples of 7.6x, 9.6x and 11.6x to projected fiscal 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which Allen & Company
refers to as EBITDA). Allen & Company derived these multiples from the multiples of selected companies in the online commerce industry which Allen & Company obtained from publicly
available information and stock prices as of May 2, 2003. To estimate the enterprise value of the realty business segment at low, mid- and high points, Allen & Company used
trailing revenue multiples of 0.7x, 4.0x and 7.3x, respectively, and 2002 realty revenue of approximately $9.4 million. Allen & Company derived these multiples from the multiples of
selected companies in the online commerce industry which Allen & Company obtained from publicly available information and stock prices as of May 2, 2003. 

        Based
on this data and the assumptions indicated, Allen & Company calculated that the implied equity value per share of LendingTree common stock ranged from a low point of $14.18
per share to a midpoint of $18.40 per share and a high point of $23.14 per share. The proposed consideration of 

$21.67
per share of LendingTree common stock as of May 2, 2003, is within the range of implied values of LendingTree common stock in the business segment valuation analysis. 

 Analysis of Premiums Paid in Stock-for-Stock Merger Transactions  

        Allen & Company identified and analyzed over 100 public stock-for-stock merger transactions valued between $250 million and
$2 billion that occurred from March 2001 to April 2003. Allen & Company did this analysis to determine premiums paid in these transactions over the applicable stock price
of the target company one day, one week and one month prior to announcement of the acquisition offer. The premiums one day prior to announcement had a mean of approximately 28% and a median of
approximately 24%; the premiums one week prior to the announcement had a mean of approximately 29% and a median of approximately 24% and the premiums one month prior to announcement had a mean of
approximately 33% and a median of approximately 29%. Based on closing stock prices for the stock of LendingTree and USA on May 2, 2003, the premium one day before the announcement of the merger
was 47.5%; the premium one week before announcement was 58.1% and the premium one month prior to announcement was 77.6%. 

        The
proposed premium to be paid in the merger is above the mean and median premiums paid in the above 100 public stock-for-stock merger transactions that
Allen & Company analyzed. 

        Allen &
Company also analyzed the premiums paid in the above 100 public stock-for-stock merger transactions as applied to publicly traded comparable
companies' market multiples. Allen & Company calculated the implied enterprise value of LendingTree based on estimated 2003 EBITDA using multiples of 3.9x, 15.5x and 22.2x, which were the low,
mean and high enterprise value to EBITDA multiples for the publicly traded comparable companies, and then calculated an implied enterprise value range of LendingTree based on those multiples giving
effect to a 29% premium paid in the above 100 public stock-for-stock merger transactions (the mean premium for one week prior to announcement). This resulted in an implied
enterprise value range with a low of $145.2 million, a mean of $580.9 million and a high of $829.2 million. The enterprise value of LendingTree implied by the merger is
$708.5 million which represents a 388% premium over the low of the enterprise value range, a 22% premium over the mean of the enterprise value range and a 15% discount from the high of the
enterprise value range. 

        Allen &
Company also calculated the implied equity value of LendingTree based on estimated 2003 after-tax earnings using multiples of 11.7x, 28.7x and 49.4x which were
the low, mean and high equity value to after-tax earnings multiples for the publicly traded comparable companies, and then calculated an implied equity value range of LendingTree based on
those multiples giving effect to a 29% premium paid in the above 100 public stock-for-stock merger transactions that Allen & Company analyzed (the mean premium for one
week prior to announcement). This resulted in an implied equity value range with a low of $221.2 million, a mean of $541.1 million and a high of $932.7 million. The equity value
of LendingTree implied by the merger is $734.2 million which represents a 232% premium over the low end of the equity value range, a 36% premium over the mean of the equity value range and a
21% discount from the high of the equity value range. The proposed premium to be paid in the merger is within the range of multiples paid in the above 100 public
stock-for-stock merger transactions as applied to current comparable companies' market trading multiples. 

 Analysis of Selected Comparable Merger Transactions  

        Allen & Company also compared the enterprise values implied by 17 comparable merger transactions in the financial services and online commerce industries
which occurred between February 10, 2000 and May 2, 2003 as multiples of last twelve months (which Allen & Company refers to as LTM) sales, EBITDA, and the ratio of price
to earnings per share (which Allen & Company 

refers
to as P/E). All multiples were based on financial information available at the closing date of the relevant transaction. The analysis indicated the following multiples:

        Based
on the ranges of enterprise value multiples for LTM sales and LTM EBITDA and the equity value multiple for LTM earnings, this analysis indicated a value range for LendingTree
common stock between $2.56 and $50.14 per share, with a median range for LendingTree common stock between $9.55 and $15.13 per share. The proposed consideration of $21.67 per share of LendingTree
common stock as of May 2, 2003, is within the range of implied values of LendingTree common stock in the above 17 comparable merger transactions. 

Analysis of USA  

 Analysis of the Historical Trading Activity of USA Common Stock  

        Allen & Company analyzed the historical price and trading activity of USA common stock. For the twelve months ended May 2, 2003, the price of USA
common stock ranged from $15.31 to $35.00, with an average daily volume of approximately 5.3 million shares. For the 90 trading days ended May 2, 2003, the price of USA common stock
ranged from $20.73 to $35.00, with an average daily volume of approximately 6.9 million shares. For the ten trading days ended May 2, 2003, the price of USA common stock ranged from
$28.19 to $35.00, with an average daily volume of approximately 10.5 million shares. 

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

        Allen & Company also reviewed the historical and projected financial results of USA and performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the different business
segments of USA for the fiscal years 2003 through 2008. This discounted cash flow analysis was based upon USA management's guidance and publicly available Wall Street analyst research for 2004 through
2008, subject to certain adjustments. Using this information, Allen & Company discounted to present value the projected stream of after-tax free cash flows (unlevered net income
plus non-cash charges less capital expenditures and working capital changes). To estimate the enterprise value range of USA's electronic retailing segment, Allen & Company used exit
multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x of trailing EBITDA and discount rates ranging from 10% to 14%. To estimate the enterprise value range of USA's information and services segment, Allen & Company used
exit multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x of trailing EBITDA and discount rates ranging from 10% to 14%. To estimate the enterprise value range of USA's travel services segment, Allen & Company used
exit multiples of 14.0x to 18.0x of trailing EBITDA and discount rates ranging from 12% to 16%. 

        Based
on this data and the assumptions indicated, including USA's net non-operating/corporate segment, Allen & Company calculated that the implied equity value per
share of USA common stock ranged from $25.18 per share to $33.15 per share plus a positive, unquantified value intrinsic to USA that includes potential value from (1) integration benefits in
connection with companies which USA recently acquired and (2) future USA acquisitions. 

 Analysis of Comparable Public Companies  

        Allen & Company analyzed the equity values implied by certain stock market data and financial information for three selected comparable companies in the
interactive commerce industry, Yahoo!, eBay and Amazon.com. Allen & Company used enterprise value as a multiple of estimated EBITDA and earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (which
Allen & Company refers to as EBITA) for 2003, and stock price as a multiple of estimated cash earnings per share (or cash P/E) for 2003. All multiples for the selected comparable companies were
based on publicly available Wall Street analyst research estimates and stock prices as of May 2, 2003, and the multiples for USA were based on USA's internal budgets, publicly available Wall
Street analyst research estimates and the stock price on May 2, 2003. The analysis indicated the following multiples:

        From
this analysis, Allen & Company determined that the USA common stock trades at a discount to these other major interactive commerce companies, both on a simple multiple basis
and a growth-adjusted basis. 

        Based
on the analyses described above, Allen & Company determined that the closing price of $34.96 of USA common stock on May 2, 2003 was a representative price for USA
common stock in that there was no evidence to assert that it was not an accurate reflection of the market price for USA common stock on such date. 

 General Matters  

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Allen & Company believes that its analyses and the
summary set forth above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analysis set forth in its opinion. Allen & Company has not indicated that any of the analyses which it performed had a greater significance than
any other. 

        In
determining the appropriate analyses to conduct and when performing those analyses, Allen & Company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, financial, market and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of LendingTree. The estimates contained in the analyses which Allen & Company
performed are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. The analyses were prepared solely
as part of Allen & 

Company's
analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio to the holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock. The analyses are not appraisals and
do not reflect the prices at which any securities may trade at the present time or at any time in the future. 

        Allen &
Company is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, recapitalizations, negotiated underwriting, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes. The board of directors of LendingTree retained Allen & Company based on such qualifications. In connection with its engagement, Allen & Company was not retained to identify,
analyze or otherwise pursue any possible transactions other than the merger, and Allen & Company has not identified, analyzed or pursued any transactions other than the merger. 

        The
board of directors of LendingTree entered into an engagement letter agreement with Allen & Company as of April 28, 2003, in which Allen & Company agreed to act
as financial advisor to LendingTree in connection with the merger and to render an opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio to the holders of LendingTree common
stock and LendingTree preferred stock. Under the engagement letter, LendingTree will pay a customary fee to Allen & Company upon consummation of the merger, and it will reimburse Allen &
Company for its travel and out-of-pocket expenses reasonably and actually incurred in connection with the performance of Allen & Company's services under the engagement
letter, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal counsel. LendingTree has also agreed to indemnify Allen & Company against certain liabilities and expenses in connection
with its engagement. 

USA's Reasons for the Merger  

        The merger will represent USA's entry into the large and attractive financial services and real estate verticals, both of which are at an early stage of online
migration. USA believes the addition of LendingTree will support its goal to be the world's largest and most profitable interactive commerce company by pursuing a multi-brand strategy. Upon completion
of the acquisition of LendingTree, USA will have a presence in seven key areas of interactive commerce that represent an estimated 75% of total interactive commerce (U.S.): travel, ticketing, goods,
personals, local/classified advertising, financial services and real estate. USA expects the acquisition of LendingTree to add another powerful brand and profitable interactive business to the USA
family and to further USA's goal of being the
largest, most profitable interactive commerce company in the world. LendingTree will have access to USA's existing base of nearly 40 million unique monthly Internet users who increasingly are
provided opportunities to become customers of more than one USA property through cross-promotion, integration and the use of special offers or discounts. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

        The following description summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock, or together referred to as LendingTree stock or LendingTree capital stock. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, regulations under the
Code, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) and to
differing interpretations. Any change in the foregoing could affect the continuing validity of the tax consequences described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Neither USA nor LendingTree has
requested or will request an advance ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as to the tax consequences of the merger. This description is not binding on the IRS, and there can be
no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions described below. 

        This
description applies only to holders of LendingTree stock who are U.S. persons. For purposes of this description, the term "U.S. person" means: 


an
individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;


a
corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof;


a
trust where (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (2) one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or


an
estate that is subject to U.S. tax on its worldwide income from all sources. 

        This
description is not a comprehensive description of all the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders of LendingTree capital stock. It applies only to holders of LendingTree
capital stock that hold their LendingTree capital stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (each referred to as a "holder"). No attempt has been made to address
all aspects of United States federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his, her or its personal circumstances or to stockholders subject to special treatment under
the United States federal income tax laws, including: 


banks,
insurance companies, trusts and financial institutions;


tax-exempt
organizations;


mutual
funds;


foreign
holders;


persons
that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;


persons
that own both LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock;


pass-through
entities and investors in pass-through entities;


traders
in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;


dealers
in securities or foreign currency;


stockholders
who received their LendingTree stock through the exercise of employee stock options, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as
compensation;


holders
of options or warrants granted by LendingTree; and


stockholders
who hold LendingTree stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other integrated investment. 

        In
addition, this discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the merger. It does not address the tax consequences of any
transaction other than the merger. 

EACH HOLDER OF LENDINGTREE STOCK SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SUCH
HOLDER.

        The
merger has been structured to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming the merger so qualifies, a holder will not recognize any gain or loss upon
receipt of USA common stock in exchange for his, her or its LendingTree stock, except in respect of cash received instead of a fractional share of USA common stock (as discussed below). The aggregate
adjusted tax basis of the shares of USA common stock (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below) received in the merger will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax 

basis
of the shares of LendingTree stock surrendered for the USA common stock, and the holding period of the USA common stock (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described
below) will include the period during which the shares of LendingTree stock were held. USA and LendingTree will not be required to complete the merger unless USA receives an opinion from Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz and LendingTree receives an opinion from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, in each case dated the closing date and to the effect that the merger will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

        A
holder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of USA common stock will generally be treated as having received such fractional share and then as having received such cash in
redemption of such fractional share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash received instead of the fractional share and the portion of the
holder's aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of LendingTree stock surrendered which is allocable to the fractional share. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain
or loss if the holding period for such shares of LendingTree stock is more than one year at the effective time of the merger. 

        A
holder of LendingTree preferred stock who receives cash for all of his, her or its shares of LendingTree preferred stock as a result of the exercise of appraisal rights in connection
with the merger generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the tax basis of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock surrendered and the amount of cash received, except
that any cash received that is or is deemed to be interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed as ordinary income. Gain or loss that is not treated as ordinary income will be capital
gain or loss and any such capital gain or loss will be long term if, as of such time, the holder of LendingTree preferred stock has held such shares for more than one year. A holder of LendingTree
preferred stock receiving cash as a result of the exercise of appraisal rights may be required to recognize gain or loss in the year the merger closes, irrespective of whether such stockholder
actually receives payment for his, her or its shares of LendingTree preferred stock in that year. The United States federal income tax discussion set forth in this Paragraph may not apply to holders
of LendingTree preferred stock who receive cash as a result of the exercise of appraisal rights and who also own LendingTree common stock. Such holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding the specific tax consequences of the merger. 

        Payments
of cash in lieu of fractional shares, and payments of cash as a result of the exercise of appraisal rights, in each case made in connection with the merger may be subject to
"backup withholding" at a rate of 30%. Backup withholding generally applies if a holder (1) fails to furnish his, her or its Taxpayer Identification Number, or TIN, (2) furnishes an
incorrect TIN, (3) fails properly to include a reportable interest or dividend payment on its United States federal income tax return or (4) under certain circumstances, fails to provide
a certified statement, signed under penalties of perjury,
that the TIN provided is its correct number and that the holder is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax, but merely an advance payment of tax,
which may be refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of tax, provided that the required information is supplied to the IRS. 

        Certain
persons are generally exempt from backup withholding, including corporations, financial institutions and certain foreign stockholders if such foreign stockholders submit a
statement, signed under penalty of perjury, attesting to their exempt status. Certain penalties apply for failure to furnish correct information and for failure to include reportable payments in
income. Each holder of LendingTree capital stock should consult with his, her or its own tax advisor as to its qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such
exemption. All stockholders who are U.S. persons exchanging shares of LendingTree stock in the merger should complete and sign the main signature form and the Substitute Form W-9
included as part of the letter of transmittal, when provided following the merger, to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an applicable exemption
exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to USA and the exchange agent). Non-corporate foreign stockholders should complete and sign IRS Form W8-BEN, in order to avoid
backup withholding. 

        Tax
matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to each holder of LendingTree capital stock will depend on the facts of that stockholder's particular situation.
The United States federal income tax discussion set forth above does not address all United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular holder and may not be applicable
to holders in special situations. We urge holders of LendingTree capital stock to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the merger. 

Appraisal Rights  

 Common Stockholders  

        Holders of LendingTree common stock do not have appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. 

 Preferred Stockholders  

        Holders of shares of LendingTree preferred stock who do not vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their
shares of LendingTree preferred stock will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. 

        The
following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262 and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of
Section 262, attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix F. All references in this summary to a "preferred stockholder" or "holder of preferred shares" or "persons who hold
preferred shares" are to the record holder of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of LendingTree
preferred stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below
properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. 

        Under
Section 262, persons who hold shares of LendingTree preferred stock who follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares of
LendingTree preferred stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by the Court. 

 Notification  

        Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, as in the case of the approval of the merger agreement by
the LendingTree stockholders, LendingTree, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and
include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes that notice, and the applicable statutory provisions are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix F. Any holder of LendingTree preferred stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review the following discussion and
Appendix F carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified will result in the loss of appraisal rights. 

 Electing Appraisal Rights  

        A holder of shares of LendingTree preferred stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to LendingTree, before the vote on the proposal to approve the
merger agreement at the LendingTree special meeting of stockholders, a separate written demand for the appraisal of the holder's preferred shares and must not vote such preferred shares in favor of
the approval of the merger agreement or consent to the merger agreement in writing (including by returning a signed proxy without indicating any voting instructions as to the proposed transactions). A
holder of LendingTree preferred stock who abstains from voting on the proposed transactions at the LendingTree special meeting of stockholders will not waive his, her or its appraisal rights under
Section 262. A holder of shares of LendingTree preferred stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the preferred shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made
and must continue to hold the preferred shares of 

record
through the effective time of the merger. A proxy or vote against the approval of the merger agreement will not in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262. The demand must reasonably inform LendingTree of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the "fair value" of the
shares held by the holder. 

        All
written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be sent or delivered to LendingTree at LendingTree, Inc., 11115 Rushmore Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina
28277, Attention: Secretary. 

 Only Record Holders May Demand Appraisal Rights  

        Only a holder of record of shares of LendingTree preferred stock is entitled to assert appraisal rights for the shares of LendingTree preferred stock registered
in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of LendingTree preferred stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and correctly, as the holder's name
appears on the holder's stock certificate(s), and must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares of LendingTree preferred stock in connection with the merger. If
the shares of LendingTree preferred stock are owned of record other than by the beneficial owner, such as by a broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), depositary or other
nominee, such demand must be executed by or for the record owner, and if the shares of LendingTree preferred stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder
of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder
such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, who holds shares of LendingTree preferred stock as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the
shares of LendingTree preferred stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to the shares of LendingTree preferred stock held for other beneficial owners;
in that case, however, the written demand must set forth the number of shares of LendingTree preferred stock as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of shares of LendingTree preferred
stock is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of LendingTree preferred stock held in the name of the record owner. We urge preferred stockholders who hold their shares
of LendingTree preferred stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights to consult with their broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the nominee to make a demand for appraisal. 

        If
the charter amendment and the merger agreement are approved, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation must notify each holder of LendingTree
preferred stock who has complied with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the approval of the merger agreement that the merger has become effective. Within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, but not later, the surviving corporation or any holder of LendingTree preferred stock who has so complied with the required conditions of Section 262 and is
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a
stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the holder's shares of LendingTree preferred stock. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and has no present intention to
file a petition, and preferred stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file such a petition or that the surviving corporation
will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of LendingTree preferred stock to initiate all necessary action to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of LendingTree preferred stock within the time period prescribed in Section 262. 

        Within
120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of LendingTree preferred stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of preferred shares not voted in favor of the approval of the merger agreement
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such preferred shares. The surviving corporation must mail the statement within ten days after
it has received a written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. 

 Appraisal Proceeding by Delaware Court  

        If a holder of shares of LendingTree preferred stock timely files a petition for an appraisal and serves a copy of the petition upon the surviving corporation,
the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all preferred
stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their LendingTree preferred shares and with whom the surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such stockholders' preferred
shares. After notice to the preferred stockholders as required by the Court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those preferred stockholders
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the holders of shares of LendingTree
preferred stock who demanded payment for their preferred shares to submit their preferred stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation on the certificate of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding; and if any preferred stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to the preferred stockholder. 

        After
determining the holders of LendingTree preferred stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of their shares of LendingTree preferred
stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value. Although LendingTree believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court. Holders of
LendingTree preferred stock considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of LendingTree preferred stock as so determined could be more than, the same as or less
than the consideration they would receive in the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of LendingTree preferred stock and that opinions from financial advisors as to fairness from a
financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Moreover, LendingTree does not anticipate offering more than the applicable merger consideration to any
preferred stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of LendingTree
preferred stock is less than the applicable merger consideration. In determining "fair value," the Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated
that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered in the appraisal
proceedings, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Court will also determine the amount of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amounts to be received by persons whose shares of LendingTree preferred stock have been appraised, and may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest that the surviving corporation would have had to pay to borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. The costs of the action may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties
as the Court deems equitable. However, costs do not include attorneys' fees and expert witness fees. Each dissenting stockholder is responsible for his, her or its attorneys' and expert witness
expenses, although upon application of a dissenting stockholder, the Court may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without 

limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. 

 Effect of Appraisal Demand on Voting and Rights to Dividends; Tax Consequences  

        Any holder of shares of LendingTree preferred stock who has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time of
the merger, be entitled to vote the shares of LendingTree preferred stock subject to the demand for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions on those shares of
LendingTree preferred stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of LendingTree preferred stock as of a record date prior to the effective time of the merger in
respect of a dividend payment date occurring before the effective time of the merger). The tax consequences to a LendingTree preferred stockholder who receives cash for his or her shares of
LendingTree preferred stock as a result of the exercise of appraisal rights are described under "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences." 

 Loss; Waiver or Withdrawal of Appraisal Rights  

        A holder of LendingTree preferred stock will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within
120 days after the effective time of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the preferred stockholder's demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require the written approval of the surviving corporation and,
once a petition for appraisal is filed, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any preferred holder absent court approval. Such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
deems just. A stockholder who withdraws his, her or its demand for appraisal of such stockholder's LendingTree preferred shares, or otherwise fails to perfect or loses the right to seek appraisal,
will receive the merger consideration that the stockholder would have been entitled to receive under the merger agreement, had the stockholder not elected to seek appraisal rights. 

Failure to follow the steps required by
Section 262 for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights (in which event the holder of LendingTree
preferred stock will be entitled to receive solely the consideration specified in the merger agreement).

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger  

        USA and LendingTree have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. USA and LendingTree will have the right to review in advance, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information and certain other limitations,
information filed with any governmental entity in connection with the merger. While USA and LendingTree believe that they will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, USA and LendingTree cannot predict whether the required regulatory approvals will be obtained within the time frame contemplated
by the merger agreement or on conditions that would not be detrimental to USA or LendingTree, or whether these approvals will be obtained at all. Under the merger agreement, in connection with
obtaining these approvals USA is not required to agree to, or to permit LendingTree to agree to, any limitation, divestiture or condition to the approval. USA and LendingTree are not aware of any
other material governmental approvals or actions that are required prior to completion of the merger other than those described below. 

        Under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (also known as the HSR Act), USA and LendingTree may not complete the merger prior to furnishing
certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been 

terminated.
The relevant filings by both USA and LendingTree were made by May 20, 2003. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated early effective on May 27, 2003. 

        In
connection with proposed merger, applications or notifications are also required to be filed with governmental entities under various laws, including those regulating real estate
brokers or agents, loan brokers and mortgage brokers and bankers. These governmental entities may disapprove the change in control of LendingTree as a result of the merger based upon the criteria set
forth in the applicable laws and regulations. It is a condition to completing the merger that we obtain any required regulatory approvals to continue to operate LendingTree's businesses in California,
Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, and in such other states which, when taken together with the ten specified states, represent at
least 95% of LendingTree's consolidated revenue for 2002. LendingTree and USA currently anticipate receiving the necessary approvals in the third quarter of 2003. However, there is no guarantee that
we will have received all necessary licenses to operate one or more of LendingTree's lines of business following a change in control as of the closing date of the merger. Any delay in acquiring
licenses, permits or other approvals that LendingTree needs to continue to operate its businesses in all 50 states by the time we complete the merger might require LendingTree to refrain from
conducting some or all of its operations in particular states for an unspecified period of time and could adversely affect LendingTree's performance and profitability following the merger. USA and
LendingTree have filed or expect to file all applications and notifications required in connection with the proposed merger. 

Certain Effects of the Merger  

 Effects on the Market for LendingTree Common Stock  

        Following the merger, we intend to cause the delisting of shares of LendingTree common stock from the Nasdaq National Market, following which shares of
LendingTree common stock will not be publicly traded. 

 Exchange Act Registration  

        Shares of LendingTree common stock are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Following the merger, we will file a Form 15 with the SEC
requesting the suspension and termination of registration of shares of LendingTree common stock under the Exchange Act. 

Accounting Treatment for the Merger  

        USA will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Accordingly, the cost to acquire shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock and outstanding stock options and warrants in excess of the carrying value of LendingTree's assets
and liabilities will be allocated to LendingTree's assets and liabilities based on their fair values, with any excess being allocated to goodwill and any identified intangible assets. The
determination of asset lives and required purchase accounting adjustments reflected in this document, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of LendingTree based
on their respective fair values, is preliminary. See the notes accompanying the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements of USA contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Resale of USA Common Stock  

        Shares of USA common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to any restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act, except for shares of USA
common stock issued to any LendingTree stockholder that is, or is expected to be, an "affiliate" of USA or LendingTree for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Persons that may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of USA 

or
LendingTree for such purposes generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, USA or LendingTree, and will include the directors and
certain executive officers of LendingTree. The merger agreement requires LendingTree to use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to execute a written agreement with USA to the
effect that such affiliate will not transfer any shares of USA common stock received as a result of the merger, except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or in a
transaction not required to be registered under the Securities Act. 

        This
proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of shares of USA common stock received by any person in connection with the merger, and USA has not authorized any person to make
any use of this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any resale of shares of USA common stock. 

CERTAIN LENDINGTREE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS    

        LendingTree
provided projections of its future financial performance to Merrill Lynch and Allen & Company in connection with their financial analyses of the merger and the
preparation of their respective fairness opinions. These projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement/prospectus only because such
information was considered by Merrill Lynch and Allen & Company in connection with their financial analyses of the merger and the preparation of their respective fairness opinions, and by
LendingTree's Board of Directors in entering into the merger agreement. These projections, which LendingTree does not ordinarily make available to the public, included the following:

Net
income is presented on an after-tax basis in 2004 and thereafter by applying a hypothetical 39% tax rate in 2004 and 36% thereafter to LendingTree's projected net
incomepre-tax. Due to its ability to carry forward historical net operating losses, LendingTree does not expect to pay taxes until late 2004. The net income projection for
2003 would be approximately $14.4 million if a hypothetical tax rate of 39% was applied to such period.

(2)
EBITDA,
as determined by LendingTree, is net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding taxes, net interest income/expense, depreciation
and amortization expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. EBITDA is not a substitute for operating performance measures under generally accepted accounting principles and
may be different from the presentation of financial information by other companies.

(3)
Earnings
per shareafter tax is presented on an after-tax basis for all years by applying a hypothetical 39% tax rate in 2003 and 2004 and 36% thereafter to
LendingTree's projected pre-tax earnings per share. 

        LendingTree's
management prepared the prospective financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Projected income for 2007 that LendingTree provided to its financial
advisors is slightly higher than LendingTree has previously disclosed to the public. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Allen & Company assumes any responsibility for the accuracy of any of the
prospective financial information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, LendingTree's independent accountants, has neither examined nor compiled the prospective financial information and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The 

PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP report incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus relates to LendingTree's historical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective
financial information and should not be read to do so. 

        LendingTree
did not prepare the projections with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, or United States generally accepted accounting principles.
LendingTree does not intend the above projections to be a forecast of financial results, and they are not guarantees of performance. The projections involve risks and are based upon a variety of
assumptions relating to LendingTree's business (including LendingTree's ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters and are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond LendingTree's and USA's control. See "Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements." Projections of this nature are inherently imprecise, and there can be no assurances that they will be realized or that actual results will not differ significantly from
those described above. These projections are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revision based on actual experience and business developments. We cannot
assure you that the assumptions made in preparing the projections will prove accurate. For these reasons, you should not regard the inclusion of the projections in this document as an indication that
USA, LendingTree, any recipient of the forecasts or their respective affiliates or representatives, considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the
projections should not be relied upon as such. We expect that there will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially greater or less than those contained
in the projections. None of USA, LendingTree or any of their respective affiliates or representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of
LendingTree compared to the information contained in the projections, and none of them has updated or otherwise revised or intends to update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error. 

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER    

        In considering the recommendation of LendingTree's board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and the charter amendment, LendingTree's stockholders
should be aware that some of LendingTree's executive officers, directors and major stockholders have interests in the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of
LendingTree's stockholders generally. These interests and arrangements may create potential conflicts of interest. LendingTree's board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts of interest
and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decisions to approve the merger agreement and to recommend that LendingTree's common and preferred stockholders vote in favor of approving the
merger agreement and the charter amendment.

        At
the close of business on [May 30], 2003, Specialty Finance Partners beneficially owned [4,493,832] shares of LendingTree common
stock and [2,156,726] shares of LendingTree preferred stock. Mr. Spass is a Director and Chairman of the Board of Capital Z Management, LLC, which is the manager
of Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, LP, which is a general partner of Specialty Finance Partners. Mr. Spass is also a Director and Chairman of the Board of Capital Z
Partners, Ltd., which is the ultimate general partner of Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, LP. Mr. Spass is also a limited partner of Capital Z Partners, LP, which is an
affiliate of Specialty Finance Partners. Mr. Lieber is a Principal of Captial Z Management, LLC which is the manager of Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, LP, which is a
general partner of Specialty Finance Partners. Mr. Leiber is also a member of Equifin Capital Partners, Ltd., which is a general partner of Specialty Finance Partners. Messrs. Lieber and
Spass each disclaim beneficial ownership of all shares of LendingTree stock beneficially owned by Specialty Finance Partners. 

        At
the close of business on [May 30], 2003, directors and executive officers of LendingTree beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately
[4,944,784] shares of LendingTree's common stock, representing approximately [19.1]% of the outstanding common stock, and approximately
[728,571] shares of LendingTree's preferred stock, representing approximately [12.3]% of the outstanding preferred stock. Collectively, these
LendingTree common shares and LendingTree preferred shares represented approximately [15.6]% of the total voting power of the LendingTree common shares and LendingTree
preferred shares as of [May 30], 2003, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred shares voting on an as-converted basis. 

        Upon
completion of the merger, the shares of LendingTree common and preferred stock held by each of the directors and executive officers of LendingTree will be converted into shares of
USA common stock on the same basis as all other shares of LendingTree common and preferred stock. 

Stock Options and Warrants  

        Pursuant to the merger agreement and the terms of LendingTree's various stock plans (excluding LendingTree's Employee Stock Purchase Plan), upon completion of the
merger each LendingTree option, including any held by directors and executive officers of LendingTree, will be converted into an option to purchase shares of USA common stock, with such option
covering 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock for each share of LendingTree common stock subject to the option (rounded to the nearest whole share of USA common stock) at an exercise price per share
equal to the per share exercise price of the LendingTree option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger divided by 0.6199 (rounded to the nearest cent) and otherwise on the same terms
and conditions as were 

applicable
to the LendingTree stock option. Each converted option that was an incentive stock option immediately prior to the effective time will be converted in a manner consistent with applicable
federal income tax rules such that the option will not cease to be treated as an incentive stock option by virtue of the conversion. In addition, upon completion of the merger each LendingTree
warrant, including any held by directors and executive officers of LendingTree, will be converted into an equivalent USA warrant on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the LendingTree warrant with 0.6199 of a share of USA common stock being subject to such warrant for every LendingTree share that was previously subject to the warrant. Based on LendingTree option and
warrant holdings on [May 30], 2003, upon completion of the merger, Messrs. Lebda, Field, Tozer, Lieber and Spass would hold options to acquire
[691,192], [260,600], [17,282], [0] and [0] shares of USA common stock and
warrants to acquire [0], [10,235], [0], [0] and [14,517] shares of USA common
stock, respectively, Messrs. Reddin, Hall, Campbell and Cunliffe would hold options to acquire [214,893], [184,384],
[134,611] and [72,064] shares of USA common stock and LendingTree's other executive officers as a group would hold options to purchase an
aggregate of [150,457] shares of USA common stock. 

Acceleration of Stock Options  

        As of [May 30], 2003, directors and executive officers of LendingTree held options to purchase an aggregate of
[2,783,485] shares of LendingTree common stock at exercise prices ranging from $[1.43] to $[15.10] per share, of
which options to purchase an aggregate of [1,103,759] shares were not yet vested or exercisable within the next 60 days. Under the terms of the equity plans under
which these options were granted, 50% of all unvested options will become vested and exercisable upon completion of the merger. Additionally, pursuant to employment continuity agreements entered into
by LendingTree with Messrs. Lebda, Reddin, Hall, Campbell and Cunliffe and eight additional senior executives of LendingTree, completion of the merger will cause each stock option and other
stock incentive award that had been granted to
each executive under a LendingTree stock incentive plan or similar arrangement to become fully vested and exercisable, to the extent that such awards had not already become vested and exercisable
pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or similar arrangement on account of the merger, and the stock options that vest and become exercisable under the employment continuity agreements will
remain exercisable until their specified expiration date. The employment continuity agreements that LendingTree has entered into with Messrs. Lebda and Reddin will be waived and superseded at
the effective time of the merger by new employment agreements that Messrs. Lebda and Reddin have entered into with Forest Merger Corp., the corporation with which LendingTree will merge. Each
such new employment agreement contains a provision relating to acceleration and post-termination exercisability of options that is substantially similar to that contained in such
employee's current employment continuity agreement with LendingTree. As a result of the change of control provisions in LendingTree's various equity compensation plans, and the employment continuity
agreements and the new employment agreements that Messrs. Lebda and Reddin have entered into with Forest Merger Corp., based on the number of options outstanding as of
[            ] and assuming that the merger is completed on [            ], options to purchase an aggregate of
[            ] shares of common stock will become vested and exercisable upon completion of the merger with Messrs. Lebda, Reddin, Hall, Campbell and Cunliffe having
options to purchase [            ], [            ], [            ],
[            ] and
[            ] of common stock becoming vested and exercisable and the other executive officers as a group having options to purchase as aggregate of
[            ] shares of common stock becoming vested and exercisable. 

Stock Retention Policy  

        LendingTree adopted a stock retention policy for all members of its executive management team, including Messrs. Lebda, Reddin, Hall, Campbell and
Cunliffe, pursuant to which a covered executive may not transfer more than 30% of the total shares that the executive has been awarded under a LendingTree stock incentive plan (which amount includes
shares subject to stock options) during the 

executive's
employment with LendingTree and during the six-month period following such executive's termination of employment. If LendingTree terminates the executive's employment without
"cause" however, the executive will remain subject to the restrictions on transfer for 45 days and not six months following such termination. Upon a change of control of LendingTree, the policy
automatically terminates with respect to all covered employees. As completion of the merger will constitute a change of control under the policy, the policy will automatically terminate upon
completion of the merger. 

Employment Agreements  

        Under the merger agreement, USA has agreed to cause LendingTree, from and after the merger, to fulfill all written employment, severance, termination, consulting
and retirement agreements to which
LendingTree or any of its subsidiaries is a party, pursuant to the terms of those agreements and applicable law. 

 Employment Continuity Agreements with Certain Executives  

        LendingTree is party to an employment continuity agreement with each of Messrs. Lebda, Reddin, Hall, Campbell and Cunliffe, and certain of its other
executive officers and key employees. As described below, the employment continuity agreements with Messrs. Lebda and Reddin will be superseded at the effective time of the merger by the new
employment agreements with Forest Merger Corp., as described below. 

        These
agreements provide employment protection for these employees following a change of control of LendingTree (as defined under the agreements). As completion of the merger will
constitute a change of control under the employment continuity agreements, the agreements will become operative upon completion of the merger. 

        The
agreement for Mr. Hall provides employment protection for two years following completion of the merger, and the agreements for Messrs. Campbell and Cunliffe and the
other executive officers and key employees provide for employment protection for one year following completion of the merger. During each executive's employment protection period, the executive will
be entitled to receive an annual base salary based on the highest monthly base salary he was receiving during the 12 months immediately preceding completion of the merger; a bonus award
opportunity with a target and maximum bonus level not less than the largest target and maximum annual incentive award payable under LendingTree's annual incentive program as in effect during the
12-month period immediately preceding completion of the merger; and participation in retirement, incentive, welfare and other employee benefit plans which, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than the greater of (1) those provided by LendingTree during the 90-day period immediately preceding completion of the merger or (2) those provided after completion
of the merger to other peer executives. During the executive's employment protection period, the annual base salary will be reviewed no more than 12 months after the last salary increase
awarded to the executive prior to the effective date of the merger, and will be increased from time to time as is substantially consistent with increases in base salary awarded to other peer
executives of LendingTree. 

        In
addition, as described above, completion of the merger will cause each executive to become fully vested in all stock option and other stock incentive awards that had been granted to
the executive under a LendingTree stock incentive plan or similar arrangement, to the extent that such awards had not already become vested pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or similar
arrangement on account of the merger, and the stock options that vest under the employment continuity agreements will remain exercisable until their specified expiration date. In the case of
Messrs. Campbell and Cunliffe and the other executive officers and key employees under the terms of the employment continuity agreements, the LendingTree board may in its discretion replace any
stock options that become vested under their employment continuity agreement with common stock of LendingTree or of 

a
successor that is equal in value to such stock options, or with equivalent value. However, the LendingTree board will not be making such a substitution in connection with the merger. 

        If
LendingTree or a successor terminates an executive's employment during his employment protection period on account of his disability or for reasons other than cause, or if an
executive resigns because of a constructive termination during his employment protection period, he will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (1) any unpaid annual base salary
and accrued time off through the termination date, (2) his target annual bonus for the performance period in which the termination occurs, prorated for the number of days he actually worked
during the performance period, and (3) any amounts previously deferred by such executive under any non-qualified deferred compensation plan (together with earnings accrued thereon).
In addition, Messrs. Campbell and Cunliffe and the other executive officers and key employees will each be entitled to receive a payment equal to the sum of their then-current
annual base salary and the annual bonus they were paid or are entitled to be paid for the 12-month period ending immediately before completion of the merger. Mr. Hall will be
entitled to receive a payment equal to two times that amount. In addition, the amounts described above will be paid to the executive's legal representatives if the executive's employment terminates as
a result of his death during the employment protection period. Unless the executive's employment terminates on account of disability or death, the executive will also be entitled to receive continued
coverage (including health plan coverage) for him and his family under the most favorable welfare benefit plans that were in place (1) during the 90-day period immediately preceding
the executive's termination date or (2) with respect to other peer executives during the employment continuation period. This coverage will continue for two years following the termination of
Mr. Hall, and will continue for one year following the termination of Messrs. Campbell and Cunliffe and the other executive officers and key employees. LendingTree or its successor may,
in lieu of providing such continued welfare benefits, pay the executive in a lump sum the estimated after-tax value to him and his family of continued welfare benefit plan coverage
following termination of the executive's employment. The employment continuity agreement may only be modified or terminated with the executive's consent, except that the agreement automatically
terminates if the executive's employment with LendingTree terminates prior to the occurrence of a change of control. However, if the executive reasonably demonstrates that the termination was
initiated by a party who has taken steps to effect a change of control of LendingTree or that his termination otherwise arose in anticipation of a change of control, a change of control will be deemed
to have taken place on the date immediately before the date of the executive's termination of employment for purposes of that executive's employment continuity agreement, and the executive will be
entitled to the rights described above. 

        Each
of the executives who is party to an employment continuity agreement is subject to a covenant not to use or reveal LendingTree's trade secrets while the employment continuity
agreement is in effect and for one year following termination of his employment, and a covenant not to hire employees of LendingTree for one year following termination of his employment. 

 Employment Agreements between LendingTree and each of Messrs. Lebda and Reddin  

        Lending Tree is party to employment agreements with each of Messrs. Lebda and Reddin governing the material terms of each such executive's employment. At
the effective time of the merger, each such agreement will be superseded by the employment agreements with the surviving corporation that are described below. LendingTree has consented to Messrs.
Lebda and Reddin entering into these employment agreements with Forest Merger Corp. 

 Employment Agreement between Forest Merger Corp. and Douglas R. Lebda  

        As of May 5, 2003, Mr. Lebda entered into an employment agreement with Forest Merger Corp. setting forth the material terms of his employment
following the completion of the merger. The agreement becomes effective upon completion of the merger (except for the restrictive covenants 

described
below, which became effective as of May 5, 2003) and will remain in effect until the fifth anniversary of the merger, provided that the agreement requires the surviving corporation
and Mr. Lebda to enter into good faith negotiations to extend the term of the agreement if Mr. Lebda provides notice to the surviving corporation of his desire to do so between eight and
six months prior to the fifth anniversary of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, this employment agreement supersedes all other employment agreements to which Mr. Lebda is a party,
including Mr. Lebda's employment continuity agreement and employment agreement with LendingTree. This employment agreement will become null and void if the merger agreement is terminated, and
Mr. Lebda's employment continuity agreement and employment agreement with LendingTree will become immediately effective and binding. 

 Position  

        During the term, Mr. Lebda will serve as chief executive officer of the surviving corporation, and he will report directly to the chief executive officer
of USA or such other person designated by USA who has certain reporting authority and responsibilities (as set forth in the employment agreement). 

 Place of Employment  

        The agreement provides that Mr. Lebda's principal place of employment will be the surviving corporation's offices in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

 Compensation  

        During the term, Mr. Lebda will receive an annual base salary of $400,000, and will be eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus in a manner
consistent with similarly situated executives of USA's subsidiaries after taking into consideration his total incentive compensation opportunities. On the effective date of the merger, pursuant to the
agreement, Mr. Lebda will become fully vested in all stock option awards that had been granted to him under a LendingTree stock incentive plan or similar arrangement, to the extent that such
awards had not already become vested pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or similar arrangement on account of the merger, and the stock options that vest under the employment agreement will
remain exercisable until the last date on which the original option was scheduled to expire (without regard to whether the termination of Mr. Lebda's employment would have resulted in a shorter
exercise period). Additionally, on the later of the effective date of the merger or the date on which the grant is approved by the compensation committee of USA's board of directors, Mr. Lebda
will receive 50,000 restricted stock units with respect to USA common stock, which stock units will have the same terms and conditions as provided for in grants of restricted stock units to other
business unit heads and senior executive officers of USA in February 2003. On or before the day immediately following the effective date of the merger, Mr. Lebda will receive 4.25% of
the common stock of the surviving corporation in the form of restricted shares, subject to the terms of a Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement (see "Restricted Share Grant
and Shareholders' Agreement" below). Following the effective date of the merger, Mr. Lebda will be evaluated annually for future equity incentives in a manner consistent with the evaluation
provided for similarly situated executives of USA and its subsidiaries after taking into consideration Mr. Lebda's total incentive compensation opportunities. 

        During
the term, Mr. Lebda will be eligible to participate in welfare, health and life insurance and pension benefit and incentive programs adopted by the surviving corporation on
the same basis as that provided to similarly situated employees of the surviving corporation generally, including but not limited to business expense reimbursement and paid vacation. 

 Severance  

        If Mr. Lebda's employment is terminated during the term by the surviving corporation without "cause" (and other than by reason of his death or disability)
or is terminated by Mr. Lebda for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the agreement), subject to Mr. Lebda's execution and non-revocation of a release and compliance
with the restrictive covenants described below, the surviving corporation will continue to pay Mr. Lebda his salary for the remainder of the term. The surviving corporation will also pay
Mr. Lebda any portion of his accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and any compensation previously earned but deferred by Mr. Lebda (together with any interest
or earnings) that has not yet been paid. 

 Restrictive Covenants  

        Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Lebda is bound by a covenant not to compete with LendingTree's businesses (or its subsidiaries or affiliates) and a covenant
not to solicit LendingTree's employees or business partners (or USA's subsidiaries or affiliates), each of which covenants apply during the term of his employment and for two years after termination
of employment for any reason. In addition, Mr. Lebda agreed not to use or disclose any confidential information of LendingTree or its affiliates. 

 Employment Agreement between Forest Merger Corp. and Thomas Reddin  

        As of May 5, 2003, Mr. Reddin entered into an employment agreement with Forest Merger Corp. setting forth the material terms of his employment
following the completion of the merger. The agreement becomes effective upon completion of the merger (except for the restrictive covenants described below, which became effective as of May 5,
2003) and will remain in effect until the fifth anniversary of the merger, provided that the agreement requires the surviving corporation and Mr. Reddin to enter into good faith negotiations to
extend the term of the agreement if Mr. Reddin provides notice to the surviving corporation of his desire to do so between eight and six months prior to the fifth anniversary of the merger.
Upon completion of the merger, this employment agreement supersedes all other
employment agreements to which Mr. Reddin is a party, including Mr. Reddin's employment continuity agreement and employment agreement with LendingTree. This employment agreement will
become null and void if the merger agreement is terminated, and Mr. Reddin's employment continuity agreement and employment agreement with LendingTree will become immediately effective and
binding. 

 Position  

        During the term, Mr. Reddin will serve as President and Chief Operating Officer of the surviving corporation, and will report to the chief executive
officer of the surviving corporation. 

 Place of Employment  

        The agreement provides that Mr. Reddin's principal place of employment will be the surviving corporation's offices in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

 Compensation  

        During the term, Mr. Reddin will receive an annual base salary of $325,000, and will be eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus in a manner
consistent with similarly situated executives of USA's subsidiaries after taking into consideration his total incentive compensation opportunities. On the effective date of the merger, pursuant to the
agreement, Mr. Reddin will become fully vested in all stock option awards that had been granted to him under a LendingTree stock incentive plan or similar arrangement, to the extent that such
awards had not already become vested pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or similar arrangement on account of the merger, and the stock options that vest 

under
the employment agreement will remain exercisable until the last date on which the original option was scheduled to expire (without regard to whether the termination of Mr. Reddin's
employment would have resulted in a shorter exercise period). On the later of the effective date of the merger or the date on which the grant is approved by the compensation committee of USA's board
of directors, Mr. Reddin will receive 25,000 restricted stock units with respect to USA common stock, which stock units will have the same terms and conditions as provided for in grants of
restricted stock units to other business unit heads and senior executive officers of USA in February 2003. On or before the day immediately following the effective date of the merger,
Mr. Reddin will receive 1.5% of the common stock of the surviving corporation in the form of restricted shares, subject to the terms of a Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement (see
"Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement" below). Following the effective date of the merger, Mr. Reddin will be evaluated annually for future equity incentives in a
manner consistent with the evaluation provided for similarly situated executives of USA and its subsidiaries after taking into consideration Mr. Reddin's total incentive compensation
opportunities. 

        During
the term, Mr. Reddin will be eligible to participate in welfare, health and life insurance and pension benefit and incentive programs adopted by the surviving corporation
on the same basis as that provided to similarly situated employees of the surviving corporation generally, including but not limited to business expense reimbursement and paid vacation. 

 Severance  

        If Mr. Reddin's employment is terminated during the term by the surviving corporation without "cause" (and other than by reason of his death or disability)
or by Mr. Reddin for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the agreement), subject to Mr. Reddin's execution and non-revocation of a release and compliance with the
restrictive covenants described below, the surviving corporation will continue to pay Mr. Reddin his salary for the remainder of the term. The surviving corporation will also pay
Mr. Reddin any portion of his accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and any compensation previously earned but deferred by Mr. Reddin (together with any interest
or earnings) that has not yet been paid. 

 Restrictive Covenants  

        Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Reddin is bound by a covenant not to compete with LendingTree's businesses (or its subsidiaries or affiliates) and a
covenant not to solicit LendingTree's employees or business partners (or USA's subsidiaries or affiliates) during the term of his employment and for two years after termination of employment for any
reason. In addition, Mr. Reddin agreed not to divulge or use any confidential information of LendingTree or its affiliates. 

Management Incentive Plan  

        Under the terms of the LendingTree Management Incentive Plan, upon a change of control, (1) any performance period in progress will be deemed to have been
completed, (2) the maximum level of performance for the performance period will be deemed to have been attained and (3) a pro rata portion of the awards granted for the performance
period will be payable in cash within 10 business days following such change of control. As completion of the merger will constitute a change of control under the Management Incentive Plan, all such
provisions will become operative and bonuses will be paid at the levels specified above. 

Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement  

        On May 5, 2003, Forest Merger Corp., USA and Messrs. Lebda and Reddin entered into a Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement, which
provides for the grant of shares of the 

surviving
corporation's common stock to the grantees no later than the day after the effective date of the merger, subject to certain restrictions. The grant of the restricted shares is subject to
completion of the merger. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, USA may cause the surviving corporation to issue awards of restricted shares upon completion of the merger up to an aggregate
of 10% of the outstanding common stock of the surviving corporation to certain executive officers of LendingTree, including Messrs. Hall, Campbell and Cunliffe, with Mr. Lebda to receive 4.25%
and Mr. Reddin to receive 1.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the surviving corporation, in each case subject to the conditions of the grant contained in the Restricted Share Grant and
Shareholders' Agreement and such executive officer's continued employment on the date immediately following the effective time of the merger. 

 Vesting  

        The shares of restricted stock granted to the grantees will vest and no longer be subject to forfeiture according to the following schedule: 


40%
on the second anniversary of the date of grant;


20%
on the third anniversary of the date of grant;


20%
on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant; and


20%
on the four and 

/

 anniversary of the date of grant. 

        In
the event that any of the grantee's employment is terminated without "cause" (other than by reason of his or her death or disability) or by the grantee for "good reason" (as these
terms are defined in the agreement), then if less than one-third of his or her restricted shares are vested, then one-third of his or her restricted shares shall become vested.
Additionally, if Mr. Lebda's employment is terminated without "cause" (other than by reason of his death or disability) or he terminates his employment for "good reason" (as defined in the
agreement), then all of his unvested restricted shares will become vested. All unvested restricted shares held by the grantees will become immediately vested upon a "change of control" of the
surviving corporation (as defined in the agreement). 

 Put and Call Rights  

 USA Call Right  

        Within 60 days of the availability of the final financial results of the surviving corporation for the fiscal year of the corporation ending immediately
following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the merger and within 60 days of the availability of final financial results for each subsequent anniversary of the closing date, USA has a
right to purchase all of the restricted shares held by any grantee at a specified "appraisal value" (as defined in the agreement). For purposes of the agreement, appraisal value means the fair market
value of the common stock of the surviving corporation, based on industry practice and valuation methodologies for a business of the type maintained by the surviving corporation, taken as a whole
divided by the aggregate number of all shares of common stock then outstanding, taking into account the capital structure of the surviving corporation, including deducting from the value of the
surviving corporation the then-accrued value of the outstanding shares of series A preferred stock of the surviving corporation plus accrued dividends on such series A
preferred stock. 

 Grantee Put Right  

        Within 60 days of the availability of the final financial results of the surviving corporation for the fiscal year of the corporation ending immediately
following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the merger and within 60 days of the availability of final financial results for each subsequent anniversary of the closing date, the chief
executive officer (or the next most senior officer holding restricted shares, 

if
the chief executive officer does not hold any) has the right to require USA to purchase all of the restricted shares of each grantee at appraisal value. 

        Upon
a termination of a grantee's employment, the appraisal value of all vested shares held by the grantee will be determined as of the end of the fiscal year in which the termination of
employment occurs, and the grantee's vested shares will only represent the right to receive the appraisal value as of such fiscal year. USA will cause the appraisal value to be paid to the grantee
following the fifth anniversary of completion of the merger on or about the time that the grantee puts described above are paid to other grantees following the fifth anniversary (or if puts are not
being paid to other grantees at that time, payment will be made to the grantee within 30 days following the fifth anniversary of the merger date). 

 Come Along and Take Along Rights  

        Except with respect to certain specified events, USA may not transfer more than 50% of the outstanding common shares of the surviving corporation to a person
other than the surviving corporation, the grantees or any affiliate of USA without first notifying the grantees and allowing the most senior officer among the grantees to elect to sell all of the
vested shares held by the grantees on the same terms. Upon the occurrence of a transfer of the common stock of the surviving corporation to a person other than the surviving corporation, the grantees
or any affiliate of USA, USA may cause the grantees to sell his or her restricted shares on the same terms as USA is selling its shares. 

 USA Purchase Option  

        USA may purchase any restricted shares that are forfeited to the surviving corporation. The fair market value of any restricted shares so purchased is applied to
reduce deemed unpaid dividends on the series A preferred stock, or, if the fair market value exceeds the accrued dividends, then also to redeem USA's shares of series A preferred stock. 

 IPO  

        In the event of an initial public offering of the surviving corporation, none of the provisions relating to puts and calls and come alongs and take alongs will be
applicable to the grantee's shares. For purposes of the agreement, an "initial public offering" generally means the closing of a sale of common stock or other equity securities of the surviving
corporation in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering under the Securities Act of 1933 in which the securities (including the restricted shares) are listed on a stock exchange or authorized
for trading through Nasdaq. In addition, each of the grantees has agreed to enter into a "lockup agreement" in connection with any initial public offering of the surviving corporation, if requested to
do so by the underwriter for such offering. 

 Termination  

        The agreement is terminated if the merger agreement is terminated. 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Directors' and Officers' Insurance  

        The merger agreement provides that LendingTree will continue to indemnify each of the present and former directors and officers of LendingTree after the
completion of the merger and will maintain for their benefit directors' and officers' insurance for six years following the completion of the merger (see "The Merger
AgreementCovenantsIndemnification; Insurance"). 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

        This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes certain aspects of the merger agreement and the proposed merger. The following description does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated in this
proxy statement/prospectus by reference. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety. 

General Terms of the Merger Agreement  

        On May 5, 2003, USA, LendingTree and Forest Merger Corp. (a transitory subsidiary incorporated to effect the merger) entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, or the merger agreement. The merger provided for by the merger agreement will become effective upon the filing of a properly executed certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. We refer to the effective time of the merger in this document as the effective time or the closing of the merger. 

        At
the effective time, Forest Merger Corp. will be merged with and into LendingTree, with LendingTree surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of USA, and the separate existence of Forest
Merger Corp. will cease. We sometimes refer to LendingTree following the completion of the merger as the surviving corporation. At the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving
corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety in a form agreed upon by USA and LendingTree (contained in Appendix E to this proxy statement/prospectus), and the bylaws of Forest
Merger Corp. will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation. At the effective time, the directors of Forest Merger Corp. will become the initial directors of the surviving corporation, and the
officers of LendingTree will continue as the officers of the surviving corporation. 

Treatment of Securities in the Merger  

 LendingTree Common Stock and Preferred Stock  

        The merger agreement provides that each share of LendingTree common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will at the effective time be
converted into the right to receive 0.6199 of a fully paid and nonassessable share of USA common stock (which, together with the cash in lieu of any fractional share of USA common stock described
below, we refer to as the common merger consideration). However, any shares of LendingTree common stock held in the treasury of LendingTree or owned by USA will be cancelled without any payment for
those shares. 

        In
addition, each share of LendingTree preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised)
will, at the effective time be converted into the right to receive the shares of USA common stock that the holder would have received had the shares of LendingTree preferred stock been converted into
LendingTree common stock immediately before the merger (which, together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares described below, we refer to as the preferred merger consideration, and together with
the common merger consideration, we refer to as the merger consideration). However, any shares of LendingTree preferred stock held in the treasury of LendingTree or owned by USA will be cancelled
without any payment for those shares. The exact number of shares of USA common stock that a holder will receive in exchange for each share of LendingTree preferred stock depends on the date we
complete the merger, because under LendingTree's certificate of incorporation the formula for calculating the number of shares of LendingTree common stock into which each share of LendingTree
preferred stock is convertible takes into account the amount of accrued dividends on the LendingTree preferred stock from the last dividend payment date through the conversion date. The minimum number
of shares of USA common stock that a holder will receive in exchange for each share of LendingTree preferred stock is approximately 0.6726 of a share of USA common stock (if we complete the merger on
a 

quarterly
dividend payment date) and the maximum is approximately 0.6859 of a share of USA common stock (if we complete the merger on the last day before a quarterly dividend payment date), since each
share of LendingTree preferred stock is convertible into between approximately 1.0850 and approximately 1.1065 shares of LendingTree common stock, depending on the conversion date. If we complete the
merger, holders of shares of LendingTree preferred stock will not receive any regularly scheduled quarterly dividends on such shares with a payment date on or after the effective date of the merger. 

        USA
will not issue any fractional shares of USA common stock in the merger; instead, a cash payment will be made to the holders of shares of LendingTree common stock and/or LendingTree
preferred stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of USA common stock. See "Cash Instead of Fractional Shares." 

        As
a result of the merger, all shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock will no longer be outstanding and will be cancelled. 

        If,
between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, the outstanding shares of USA common stock or LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock are changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, USA common stock or LendingTree common stock or preferred stock), stock combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or otherwise,
then the exchange ratio will be adjusted to preserve the economic effect of the merger to LendingTree stockholders. 

 Forest Merger Corp. Common Stock  

        At the effective time, all outstanding shares of common stock of Forest Merger Corp. will be automatically converted into (1) a number of shares of
Series A preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation having a liquidation preference of $734,500,000, and (2) a number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation equal to the excess of 1,000 over the aggregate number of shares of the surviving corporation's common stock that are sold to specified members of
LendingTree's senior management. In the aggregate, we expect the surviving corporation will sell 100 shares of its common stock to those individuals, subject to the terms and restrictions of the
Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement (see "Interests of Certain Persons in the MergerRestricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement"), or 10% of the common equity of the
surviving corporation. The remainder of the common equity of the surviving corporation will be held by USA. 

 LendingTree Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards  

        Each outstanding option to purchase shares of LendingTree common stock granted under LendingTree's employee and director stock plans, but excluding the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, at the effective time, will be converted into an option to purchase shares of USA common stock on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the original LendingTree
stock option. The number of shares of USA common stock subject to each newly converted USA stock option will be the number of shares of LendingTree common stock subject to the LendingTree stock option
immediately before the effective time multiplied by 0.6199, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of USA common stock, and such USA stock option will have an exercise price per share
(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in the original LendingTree stock option divided by 0.6199. In the case of any LendingTree stock option to which
Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code applies immediately before the effective time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, the exercise price,
the number of shares of USA common stock subject to the converted stock option and the terms and conditions of exercise of the stock option 

will
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

        LendingTree
will take such actions as are necessary to provide that (1) participation in the LendingTree Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be limited to those employees who were
participants on May 5, 2003, (2) participants may not increase their payroll deduction election or purchase elections from those in effect on May 5, 2003, (3) if the
effective time is prior to June 30, 2003, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan will terminate upon the effective time and all balances in Employee Stock Purchase Plan participant accounts will be
delivered to participants as soon as practicable after the effective time in accordance with the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and (4) if the effective time is on or after
June 30, 2003, (A) purchases will be made under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan with respect to the plan purchase periods ending on June 30, 2003 (however if the date on which
the effective time occurs is scheduled to be June 30, 2003, such purchase period(s) will end on June 27, 2003), (B) any Employee Stock Purchase Plan purchase periods scheduled to
commence on July 1, 2003 will be suspended pending consummation of the merger, during which time no payroll deductions will be made under the plan and (C) the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan will terminate on the date we complete the merger. 

 LendingTree Warrants  

        Each warrant to purchase LendingTree common stock that is outstanding immediately before the effective time will, at the effective time, be assumed by USA and be
converted into a warrant to purchase shares of USA common stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
applicable warrant agreement in effect at the effective time, except that: (1) each newly converted USA common stock warrant will be exercisable for a number of shares of USA common stock equal
to the number of shares of LendingTree common stock subject to the LendingTree warrant immediately before the effective time multiplied by 0.6199, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
USA common stock and (2) the exercise price per share of USA common stock subject to each such newly converted USA warrant will be equal to the per share exercise price specified in the
LendingTree warrant divided by 0.6199 (rounded to the nearest cent). However, as to any LendingTree warrant (1) that in connection with a merger permits LendingTree at its election to make
payment of a cash sum in exchange for such warrant in lieu of exchanging the warrant for consideration based on the consideration to be received by holders of LendingTree common stock in such merger
and (2) as to which USA has given LendingTree written notice not less than five business days before the effective time of USA's desire for LendingTree to effect such exchange for cash,
LendingTree will exchange, or will cause to be exchanged, such LendingTree warrant for the cash amount specified in the warrant and LendingTree will otherwise comply with all of the provisions of the
LendingTree warrant relating to such exchange. 

Exchange of Certificates  

 Exchange Agent  

        USA will appoint an exchange agent to handle the exchange of LendingTree stock certificates for shares of USA common stock in the merger and the payment of cash
for fractional shares that LendingTree stockholders otherwise would have received in the merger. 

 Exchange Procedures  

        Prior to the effective time, USA will deposit with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree
preferred stock, certificates representing the shares of USA common stock issuable in the merger. 

        As
soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of a LendingTree certificate a letter of transmittal and instructions for
exchanging the holder's
LendingTree certificates for the merger consideration. After receipt of the transmittal forms, each holder of a LendingTree certificate will be able to surrender his, her or its LendingTree
certificate to the exchange agent, and the holder of a LendingTree certificate will receive in exchange a book-entry statement reflecting (or, if requested, certificates representing) that
number of whole shares of USA common stock to which the holder of the LendingTree certificate is entitled, together with any cash which may be payable instead of fractional shares of USA common stock
and any dividends or other distributions with respect to USA common stock having a record date and paid after the effective time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of LendingTree
common stock or LendingTree preferred stock which is not registered on the transfer records of LendingTree, a book-entry statement reflecting (or a certificate representing) the proper
number of shares of USA common stock, any cash instead of fractional shares of USA common stock and applicable dividends and distributions may be issued and paid to a transferee if the LendingTree
certificate representing the applicable LendingTree shares is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. The consideration to be issued in the merger will be delivered by the exchange agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of a LendingTree
certificate and any other required documents. No interest will be payable on the merger consideration, regardless of any delay in making payments. 

 Dividends and Other Distributions  

        Holders of shares of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions payable by USA in
respect of USA common stock until they exchange their LendingTree certificates for shares of USA common stock. After they deliver their LendingTree certificates to the exchange agent, those
stockholders will receive, subject to applicable law, the amount of dividends or other distributions on USA common stock having a record date after the effective time previously paid and, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions on USA common stock with a record date after the effective time and a payment date after the surrender of such LendingTree
certificates, without interest. 

 Cash Instead of Fractional Shares  

        No fractional shares of USA common stock will be issued upon the surrender of LendingTree certificates. No dividend or distribution will relate to any fractional
share of USA common stock that would otherwise be issuable in the merger, and those fractional shares of USA common stock will not entitle the owner to any voting rights of a USA stockholder. 

        Holders
of shares of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock otherwise entitled to fractional shares of USA common stock, if any, will receive a cash payment instead of
the fractional share of USA common stock they would otherwise be entitled to receive upon surrender of their LendingTree certificates. Following completion of the merger, the exchange agent will
determine the excess of the number of whole shares of USA common stock delivered to the exchange agent by USA
for distribution to LendingTree stockholders over the aggregate number of whole shares of USA common stock to be distributed to LendingTree stockholders. The exchange agent will then, on behalf of the
former LendingTree stockholders, sell the excess shares of USA common stock at the then-prevailing prices on the open market, in the manner provided for in the merger agreement, and make
the proceeds available for distribution to the former holders of shares of LendingTree common stock and/or LendingTree preferred stock otherwise entitled to fractional shares of USA common stock upon
surrender of their LendingTree certificates. USA will pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other associated out-of-pocket transaction costs relating to the sale by the
exchange agent of shares of USA common stock. 

 Return of Exchange Fund  

        Any shares or cash held by the exchange agent on behalf of the former holders of shares of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock that remains
undistributed to the former LendingTree stockholders for one year after the effective time will be delivered to USA, upon demand, and USA will then act as exchange agent. After the second anniversary
of the effective time, former LendingTree stockholders that have not validly exchanged LendingTree certificates for the merger consideration will be required to look as a general creditor only to USA
for payment of the merger consideration, subject to applicable law. 

        Each
of the exchange agent, the surviving corporation and USA will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under the merger agreement to any holder of
LendingTree certificates any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
under the Internal Revenue Code, or any provisions of state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or USA, the withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of LendingTree common stock or LendingTree preferred stock, as the case may be, in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made. 

 Lost Certificates  

        In the event any certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable
merger consideration for which the certificate would have been exchanged under the merger agreement, provided that the person claiming that such certificate was lost, stolen or destroyed makes an
affidavit of that fact and, if reasonably required by USA, posts a bond in such amount as USA may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against USA with
respect to such certificate.

retain the services of their key officers and key employees. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, LendingTree has agreed (as to itself and its 

subsidiary)
that, without USA's prior consent, it will not take any of the following actions prior to the completion of the merger: 


incur
any indebtedness for borrowed money, assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as an accommodation become responsible for the obligations of any other person, or make

except
pursuant to contracts or agreements in force on May 5, 2003, make any material investment or acquisition, whether by purchase of stock or securities,

except
for transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
LendingTree, terminate, amend or waive any material provision of any LendingTree material contract, or make any material change in any instrument or agreement governing the terms of any lease or
contract other than normal renewals of contracts and leases without material adverse changes of terms;


except
in the ordinary course of business (other than for directors or officers of LendingTree) and at times and in amounts consistent with past practice, or to the extent

        The
term "material adverse effect," as used in the merger agreement, refers, with respect to LendingTree or USA, as the case may be, to any change or effect that is or would reasonably
be expected to be materially adverse to (1) the businesses, operations, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (2) the
ability of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in a timely manner; except that a material adverse effect will not be deemed to include the impact of any
change or effect relating to or arising from the execution, announcement or consummation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including any impact on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers or employees. 

        USA
has agreed that, prior to the completion of the merger: 


USA
will not adopt any amendments to its certificate of incorporation that would materially adversely affect the terms and provisions of the USA common stock or the rights
of the holders of shares of USA common stock without LendingTree's prior consent;


neither
USA nor any of its affiliates, without LendingTree's consent, will, directly or indirectly, except under the merger agreement or the voting agreements, purchase or
otherwise acquire any LendingTree securities or otherwise intentionally vote or acquire the right to vote LendingTree securities;


USA
will cause Forest Merger Corp. to perform its obligations under the merger agreement; and


USA
will not take any affirmative action to cause the delisting of the USA common stock from Nasdaq, unless, contemporaneously, USA common stock has been approved for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Acquisition Transactions  

        LendingTree agreed in the merger agreement not to initiate, solicit, negotiate, knowingly encourage or provide confidential information to facilitate any proposal
or offer to acquire more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries, or capital stock of LendingTree or any of its
subsidiaries representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total voting power of all of such entity's voting securities, in each case whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or
otherwise (we refer to a transaction that meets these criteria an as acquisition 

transaction).
However, before obtaining the required approvals by LendingTree's stockholders of the merger agreement and the charter amendment: 


LendingTree
or its board of directors may furnish confidential or non-public information to, and negotiate with, the potential acquirer (provided that
LendingTree has received from the potential acquirer a confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as stringent in all material respects as the confidentiality agreement entered into with USA)
in response to an unsolicited bona fide written offer or proposal for a potential or proposed acquisition transaction (which we refer to in this document as an acquisition proposal) which the board of
directors of LendingTree determines, in good faith (1) after consultation with its independent financial advisor, would reasonably be expected to result (if consummated pursuant to its terms
and which consummation is reasonably possible) in an acquisition transaction more favorable to LendingTree's stockholders than the USA merger (we refer to such an acquisition proposal as a qualifying
proposal) and (2) after having received and considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the LendingTree board of directors under applicable law, and


LendingTree
or its board of directors may resolve to accept, or recommend, and, upon termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the applicable termination
provision and after payment to USA of the required fee, enter into agreements relating to, a qualifying proposal as to which the board of directors of LendingTree has determined in good faith
(1) after consultation with its independent financial advisor would result in an acquisition transaction more favorable to LendingTree's stockholders than the USA merger and is reasonably
capable of being financed and
consummated and (2) after having received and considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the LendingTree board of directors under applicable law (in this document we refer to such a qualifying proposal as a superior proposal). 

        In
addition, LendingTree's board of directors is permitted to take and disclose to LendingTree's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act or otherwise make disclosure required by the federal securities laws or the board's fiduciary duties, as determined in good faith by the LendingTree board of directors. 

        LendingTree
agreed in the merger agreement promptly to notify USA after receipt of any acquisition proposal, substantive indication of interest or request for non-public
information relating to LendingTree in connection with an acquisition proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of LendingTree or any subsidiary by any person that after the date
merger agreement informs the board of directors of LendingTree or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an acquisition proposal. LendingTree agreed promptly to keep USA informed
orally and in writing of any material changes or developments with respect to any activities or discussions relating to an acquisition proposal. 

        LendingTree
also agreed in the merger agreement immediately to cease and terminate any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement with
any parties other than USA with respect to any of the above activities, and agreed not to waive any standstill or confidentiality provisions. LendingTree is required promptly to provide to USA any
information regarding LendingTree or its subsidiaries provided after the date of the merger agreement to any person making an acquisition proposal, unless such information has been previously provided
to USA. 

 LendingTree Stockholder Approval  

        LendingTree has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause a special meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the
purpose of obtaining the required stockholder approvals of the merger agreement and the charter amendment. LendingTree's board of directors is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its stockholders the votes required by Delaware law or LendingTree's charter in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the charter amendment and any other related matters required to
be approved in connection with the merger, and to recommend to LendingTree's stockholders that they so vote at the stockholder meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. However,
LendingTree's board of directors will
not be required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain those approvals or to make or continue to make such recommendations if LendingTree's board of directors, after having received and
considered the advice of, and after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, determines that such action would cause the members of LendingTree's board of directors to breach their
fiduciary duties under applicable law. Unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated, LendingTree is required to submit the merger agreement and charter amendment proposal to its stockholders for
approval at a duly held stockholder meeting, whether with or without the recommendation of its board of directors. 

 Nasdaq Quotation  

        USA has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of USA common stock issuable in the merger (including the shares of USA common stock
reserved for issuance upon exercise of converted LendingTree stock options and LendingTree warrants) to be eligible for quotation on Nasdaq (or other national market or exchange on which USA common
stock is then traded or quoted) before the effective time. 

 Indemnification; Insurance  

        For six years after the effective time, USA will cause to be maintained in effect the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies currently maintained
by LendingTree (however USA may substitute similar policies containing terms that are not less advantageous in any material respect issued by a reputable insurance company) covering matters or events
occurring before the effective time to the extent available. However, USA and its affiliates are not required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by
LendingTree to maintain this insurance coverage, and, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the maximum amount, USA will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

        From
and after the effective time, the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of LendingTree or any of its subsidiaries,
determined as of the effective time, against any costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action or suit existing
or occurring at or before the effective time. The surviving corporation will assume all rights of the indemnified parties to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or before the effective time as provided in the respective charter or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of LendingTree or any of its subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
the merger agreement. Any indemnification agreements or arrangements of LendingTree or any of its subsidiaries provided to USA prior to the date of the merger agreement will survive the merger and
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The rights of the indemnified parties under these agreements will not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect those
rights, unless the modification is required by law. 

        For
six years after the effective time, (1) the charter and bylaws of the surviving corporation will contain provisions no less favorable to the indemnified parties described
above with respect to indemnification and to limitation of certain liabilities of directors and officers than are contained as of 

the
date of the merger agreement in LendingTree's charter and bylaws, and (2) the charter and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each subsidiary of the surviving corporation
will contain the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors and officers. These provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights of the indemnified parties under those instruments. 

        In
the event that USA or the surviving corporation or their respective successors or assigns (1) consolidate with or merge into another person and are not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (2) transfer or convey all or substantially all of their properties and assets to any person, then USA and the surviving
corporation will ensure that proper provision be made so that the successors and assigns of USA or the surviving corporation assume the obligations of USA and the surviving corporation in the merger
agreement relating to indemnification of directors and officers of LendingTree and its subsidiaries. 

 Employee Matters  

        From and after the effective time, USA has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to fulfill all employment, bonus, consulting, termination, severance, change
in control and indemnification agreements that had been disclosed to USA as of the date of the merger agreement to which LendingTree or any subsidiary was a party. The surviving corporation may amend,
suspend or terminate any of these agreements to the extent permitted under the terms of the agreement. For at least one year from the effective time, USA agreed in the merger agreement that
LendingTree employees who remain in the employ of the surviving corporation will be offered benefit plan participation and coverage (other than incentive plan participation and coverage) at levels
that are reasonably comparable (or better), on an aggregate basis, to those currently in effect under LendingTree's benefit plans. 

        USA
and the surviving corporation will cause their respective employee benefit and compensation plans that cover any of LendingTree's employees who remain employed by the surviving
corporation as of the effective time to count service that has been recognized by LendingTree and its affiliates, without duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting, but not benefit accrual, to the same extent such service was recognized under any similar LendingTree benefit plan. However, the obligations of USA and the surviving
corporation described in the previous sentence will not apply to newly established plans for which prior service is not taken into account. 

        With
respect to benefit plans that would otherwise be applicable to newly hired employees, USA and the surviving corporation will cause all waiting periods and pre-existing
conditions and proof of insurability provisions for all conditions that any LendingTree employee who remains employed by the surviving corporation as of the effective time has as of the effective time
to be waived for such employee to the same extent such provisions are waived or satisfied under LendingTree's benefit plans for the year in which the merger occurs. USA and the surviving corporation
will give any LendingTree employee who remains employed by the surviving corporation as of the effective time credit, for purposes of USA's and the surviving corporation's vacation and/or other paid
leave benefit programs, for such employee's accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the effective time. 

 Share Issuance  

        On the date immediately following the effective time, USA will cause the surviving corporation to sell shares of its common stock to specified members of
LendingTree's senior management, subject in each case to such individual continuing to be employed by LendingTree immediately prior to the effective time and provided that such individual has not
taken any action that would constitute grounds for termination for "cause" pursuant to such individual's employment agreement. In the aggregate, the shares of the surviving corporation sold to these
individuals will comprise 100 shares of common stock, subject to the terms and restrictions of the Restricted Share Grant and Shareholders' Agreement (see 

page 66),
or 10% of the common equity of the surviving corporation. The remainder of the common equity of the surviving corporation will be held by USA. 

 Additional Covenants  

        LendingTree and USA have agreed to other customary covenants in the merger agreement, relating to, among other matters: 


access
to information, and confidential treatment of that information;


tax
matters;


actions
that would result in a material breach of any of the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in the merger agreement;


the
preparation of this proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part;


the
taking of specified actions to facilitate completion of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the taking of additional actions
after the effective time that are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of the merger agreement;


the
obtaining of any consents or approvals necessary in order to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;


LendingTree's
efforts to cause its affiliates to deliver to USA the written agreements described above under "The MergerResale of USA Common Stock";


notification
to the other parties to the merger agreement of specified matters prior to completion of the merger;


the
agreement not to take actions that would jeopardize qualification of the merger as a reorganization under U.S. tax laws, and to employ reasonable efforts to obtain tax
opinions of counsel;


public
announcements related to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and


actions
to exempt the acquisition and disposition of securities in connection with the merger under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 

Conditions to the Merger  

        The respective obligations of USA and LendingTree to effect the merger, and the charter amendment in the case of LendingTree, are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of a number of customary conditions before completion of the merger, including all of the following: 


LendingTree's
stockholders must approve the merger agreement by the required vote.


LendingTree's
stockholders must have approved the charter amendment by the required votes, and a certificate of amendment must have been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware to effect the charter amendment.


The
shares of USA common stock issuable to LendingTree stockholders in the merger (including the shares of USA common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of converted
LendingTree stock options and LendingTree warrants) must have been authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other national exchange on which USA common stock is then quoted or listed).


The
waiting period (and any extension) applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, must have expired or
been terminated. 


All
notifications, consents, authorizations or other approvals required to be made with or obtained from any governmental entity before completion of the merger
(1) under applicable U.S. state insurance and consumer lending laws and other federal, state and local laws regulating real estate brokers or agents, real estate brokerage referral services or
exchanges, mortgage brokers or agents, mortgage bankers, lending, servicing loans or selling of credit or other insurance for or relating to the operation of LendingTree's businesses in California,
Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, and in such other states which, when taken together with the listed ten states, represent at least
95% of LendingTree's consolidated revenues for 2002 or (2) where the failure to obtain the required authorization or other consent would have a material adverse effect on either LendingTree or
USA. However, this condition applies to LendingTree's obligation to complete the merger and effect the charter amendment only to the extent that the failure to make or obtain the notification,
consent, authorization or approval would make consummation of the merger an illegal act by LendingTree.


The
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part shall have become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending that
effectiveness will have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose will have been initiated or threatened by the SEC.


No
injunction, statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree will have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any governmental entity which prohibits,
materially restricts or makes illegal consummation of the merger, and no governmental entity will have instituted any proceeding or be threatening to institute any proceeding seeking such an order,
injunction or decree.


LendingTree
and USA will have received written opinions of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, respectively, dated as of the closing
date of the merger, to the effect that the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

        The
obligations of LendingTree to effect the merger and the charter amendment are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of additional conditions, including all of the
following: 


The
representations and warranties of USA and Forest Merger Corp. made in the merger agreement will be, as of the closing date of the merger, true in all material respects
(in the case of representations not qualified by materiality) and in all respects (in the case of representations qualified by materiality) as to the following subjects: corporate organization,
capitalization, authority to enter into the merger agreement, financial statements, governmental consents and approvals, the conduct of Forest Merger Corp., certain tax matters, the veracity of
matters disclosed in this proxy statement/prospectus and the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to USA since December 31, 2002.


The
representations by USA and Forest Merger Corp. other than those described in the preceding bullet will (without giving effect to any materiality qualifier) be true and
correct as of the closing date of the merger except for such failures to be true and correct that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on USA.


USA
and Forest Merger Corp. will have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by each of them under the merger agreement at or prior to
the effective time, and LendingTree will have received certificates signed on behalf of USA by an appropriate executive officer of USA to that effect. 

        The
obligations of USA to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of additional conditions, including all of the following: 


The
representations and warranties of LendingTree made in the merger agreement will be, as of the closing date of the merger, true and correct in all material respects (in
the case of representations not qualified by materiality) and in all respects (in the case of representations qualified by materiality) as to the following subjects: corporate organization,
capitalization, authority to enter into the merger agreement and to adopt the charter amendment, LendingTree's stockholder rights agreement, financial statements, the absence of any material adverse
effect with respect to LendingTree since December 31, 2002, undisclosed legal proceedings, certain tax matters, certain employee benefits matters, compliance with applicable laws, possession of
necessary permits and licenses, ownership of
intellectual property, material contracts, undisclosed liabilities, compliance with certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law governing takeovers, transactions with affiliates and
obtaining opinions from LendingTree's financial advisors.


The
representations by LendingTree other than those described in the preceding bullet will (without giving effect to any materiality qualifier) be true and correct as of the
closing date of the merger except for such failures that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on LendingTree.


LendingTree
will have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time, and USA
will have received certificates signed on behalf of LendingTree by its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer to that effect.


LendingTree's
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, as of May 5, 2003, will continue to be employed by LendingTree in those positions, there will exist
no reasonable basis to believe that each such executive will not continue to be employed by the surviving corporation following the merger and neither of such individuals will have taken any action
that would constitute "cause" for termination under his employment agreement (unless as a result of death or disability of one (but not both) of such executives). 

Termination of the Merger Agreement; Effects of Termination  

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time: 


By
the mutual written consent of USA and LendingTree.


By
either USA or LendingTree if any governmental entity that must grant a regulatory approval described as a condition to closing under "Conditions to the
Merger" has denied approval of the merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final nonappealable order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.


By
LendingTree (provided that LendingTree is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement) if
there has been a breach by USA or Forest Merger Corp. of its covenants or agreements or its representations or warranties set forth in the merger agreement, which is not cured as promptly as
practicable and in any case within 30 days following written notice by LendingTree to USA or which by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the closing date of the merger.


By
USA (provided that neither USA nor Forest Merger Corp. is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger
agreement) if 

(1) there
has been a breach by LendingTree of its covenants or agreements or its representations or warranties set forth in the merger agreement, or (2) there has been a material breach
(including any prohibited transfer or other disposition of any LendingTree securities) by any party (other than USA) to a voting agreement entered into in connection with the merger agreement, and
which, in either case, is not cured as promptly as practicable and in any case within 30 days following written notice by USA to LendingTree or which by its nature or timing cannot be cured
prior to the closing date of the merger. 


By
LendingTree if prior to receipt of the required stockholder approvals of the merger agreement and the proposed charter amendment (1) LendingTree receives a
"superior proposal," (2) LendingTree has promptly notified USA of its intention to terminate the merger agreement (such notice to be accompanied by full details of the terms and conditions of
the superior proposal) and has otherwise complied with its obligations described under "Acquisition Transactions," (3) if requested by USA within two business days after its
receipt of the full details of the terms and conditions of the superior proposal, LendingTree has negotiated during the following five business days with USA to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement as would enable LendingTree to proceed with the merger on such adjusted terms, and notwithstanding such negotiations and adjustments, the board of directors of
LendingTree concludes, in its good faith judgment, that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on such terms as adjusted, are not at least as favorable to the stockholders of
LendingTree as the superior proposal and (4) the board of directors of LendingTree thereafter resolves to accept the superior proposal after having received and considered the advice of, and
after consultation with, its independent, outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of LendingTree's board of directors under
applicable law. If USA's proposal under clause (3) above is at least as favorable to the stockholders of LendingTree as the superior proposal, the merger agreement will promptly be amended to
reflect such terms and LendingTree will no longer have the right to terminate the merger agreement under this provision with respect to the original superior proposal. 

Termination
of the merger agreement by LendingTree under this provision will not be effective until LendingTree has made payment to USA of a fee of $25 million. 


By
USA, if the board of directors of LendingTree has failed to recommend, or has withdrawn, or modified in any respect materially adverse to USA, its approval or
recommendation of the merger agreement or has resolved to take any such action, or has recommended another "acquisition proposal" or if the board of directors of LendingTree has resolved to accept a
superior proposal or has failed publicly to affirm its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement within ten days of USA's request made after any acquisition proposal has been disclosed to
LendingTree's stockholders generally. 

If
LendingTree terminates the merger agreement under this provision, LendingTree must pay USA a fee of $10 million within two business days of such termination, and an additional
$15 million on the earliest to occur of the one-year anniversary of the termination date, the date that LendingTree, directly or indirectly, enters into a definitive agreement for
an "acquisition transaction" or the date that an acquisition transaction is consummated. 


By
USA or LendingTree if the stockholders of LendingTree fail to approve the merger agreement upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders called for that purpose
(including any adjournment or postponement). 

If
LendingTree or USA terminates the merger agreement under this provision, LendingTree must pay USA a fee of $25 million if (1) at the time of the LendingTree stockholder meeting an
acquisition proposal involving more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the business, properties 

or
assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries has been disclosed publicly or to LendingTree and (2) within 12 months of
termination of the merger agreement, LendingTree, directly or indirectly, enters into a definitive agreement for an acquisition transaction involving more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the
business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries or such an acquisition transaction is consummated. 


By
USA or LendingTree if the effective time has not occurred on or before December 5, 2003, unless the effective time has not occurred due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe its covenants and agreements in the merger agreement. However, if on December 5, 2003 each of the conditions to the merger, other
than those relating to LendingTree stockholder approvals, required regulatory approvals and/or the existence of injunctions or other legal bars or governmental proceedings, has been fulfilled or is
capable of being fulfilled, then the date on which a party may terminate the merger agreement under this provision will be automatically extended to February 5, 2004. 

LendingTree
must pay USA a fee of $25 million if LendingTree terminates the merger agreement under this provision and if the following conditions are met: 


at
the time of the termination, USA would have been permitted to terminate the merger agreement because of a willful or bad faith breach by LendingTree of any material
covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement;


prior
to such termination, an acquisition proposal has been disclosed publicly or to LendingTree that contemplates direct or indirect consideration for the LendingTree
common stock and LendingTree preferred stock (including the value of any stub equity) in excess of the aggregate merger consideration payable under the merger agreement; and


within
12 months following the termination, LendingTree directly or indirectly enters into a definitive agreement for an acquisition transaction involving more than
thirty-three percent (33%) of the business, properties or assets of LendingTree and its subsidiaries or of the capital stock of LendingTree or its subsidiaries or such an acquisition transaction is
consummated. 

Amendment; Extension; Waiver  

 Amendment  

        The merger agreement may be amended by USA and LendingTree in a written instrument signed by both parties prior to the effective time; provided, however, that
after adoption of the merger agreement by LendingTree's stockholders, no amendment may be made which by law requires further approval of the stockholders of LendingTree without the further approval of
such stockholders. 

 Extension; Waiver  

        At any time prior to the effective time, USA and LendingTree may, in writing, (1) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement and
(3) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement. However, after any approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by
LendingTree's stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of the merger agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the
consideration to be delivered to the holders of LendingTree securities under the merger agreement, other than as contemplated by the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of USA or LendingTree
to any such extension or waiver will be 

valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party; however, such extension or waiver or the failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition under the merger agreement will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

Fees and Expenses  

        Except as set forth in "Termination of the Merger Agreement; Effects of Termination," all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the related transactions will be paid by the party incurring the expenses. However, the costs and expenses of printing and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and
other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the merger will be divided equally between USA and LendingTree. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF USA    

        In the tables below, we provide you with unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information for USA giving effect to the following transactions: 


USA's
acquisition of a controlling interest in Expedia completed on February 4, 2002 (the Expedia transaction),


USA's
contribution of the USA Entertainment Group to VUE, a new joint venture controlled by Vivendi, completed on May 7, 2002 (the VUE transaction),


the
exchange by Liberty of its shares of Home Shopping Network, Inc. for 31.6 million shares of USA common stock and 1.6 million shares of USA
Class B common stock completed on June 27, 2002 (the Holdco exchange),


the
merger of Ticketmaster with a wholly owned subsidiary of USA completed on January 17, 2003 (the Ticketmaster merger),


the
proposed merger of Expedia with a wholly owned subsidiary of USA (the Expedia merger),


the
proposed merger of Hotels.com with a wholly owned subsidiary of USA (the Hotels merger), and


the
proposed merger of LendingTree with a wholly owned subsidiary of USA (the LendingTree transaction). 

        We
present the results of the USA Entertainment Group as discontinued operations in the historical financial statements of USA, and therefore have excluded those results from the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of USA. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of USA reflect some assumptions regarding the transactions and are based on the historical financial statements of USA and
the historical financial statements of LendingTree. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of USA, including the notes accompanying them, are qualified in their entirety by
reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, USA's and LendingTree's audited and unaudited financial statements, including the notes accompanying them, which have been filed with the SEC. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2003 gives effect to the Expedia merger, the Hotels merger and the LendingTree transaction as if they
occurred on March 31, 2003. All other transactions described above have been reflected in the historical balance sheet as of March 31, 2003. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2003 reflects USA's and LendingTree's unaudited statements of operations
for the three months ended March 31, 2003, adjusted for the pro forma effects of the Ticketmaster merger, the Expedia merger, the Hotels merger and the LendingTree transaction as if those
transactions had occurred on January 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 reflects USA's and LendingTree's
audited statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, adjusted for the pro forma effects of the Expedia transaction, the VUE transaction, the Holdco exchange, the Ticketmaster
merger, the Expedia merger, the Hotels merger and the LendingTree transaction as if those transactions had occurred on January 1, 2002. 

        USA
is in the process of evaluating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Ticketmaster acquired in the Ticketmaster merger, the assets and liabilities of Expedia and Hotels.com
to be acquired in the Expedia and Hotels mergers, respectively, and the assets and liabilities of LendingTree to be acquired in the LendingTree transaction, including the allocation of merger
consideration to 

intangibles
other than goodwill. Accordingly, this purchase accounting information is preliminary and has been made solely for the purpose of developing the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial information contained in the following pages. 

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet and statement of operations are neither necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial
position that would have been reported had these transactions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented for the statements of
operations and as of March 31, 2003 for the balance sheet nor are they necessarily indicative of USA's future financial results of operations.

Represents
the financial position and results of operations for LendingTree based on the historical information of LendingTree.

2.
Represents
the issuance of 94.1 million shares of USA common stock to Expedia security holders in the Expedia merger based on an exchange ratio of 1.93875 shares of USA
common stock for each share of Expedia common stock. Also includes options to acquire 46.8 million shares of USA common stock and warrants to acquire 24.5 million shares of USA common
stock, in each case based on an exchange ratio of 1.93875. The price used to value the securities is $26.47, which is the average of the closing prices of USA common stock on the two trading days
prior to, the day of, and the two trading days following, the announcement of the Expedia merger. The amount recorded as deferred compensation in shareholders' equity is the estimated impact of
unvested stock options and warrants as of the merger date, at their fair value. The acquisition costs and resulting goodwill are as follows:

Excess of merger consideration over minority interest acquired, deferred

$

3,357,899

USA
has used the independent valuation from the initial identification of intangibles other than goodwill prepared in connection with the Expedia transaction to estimate the intangible assets acquired
in the Expedia merger. Additional intangible assets that have been identified include: trade name and trademarks, technology, hotel supplier relationships and distribution agreements. A portion of the
excess Expedia merger consideration over minority interest acquired and deferred compensation has been preliminarily allocated to these intangible assets and the remainder is allocated to goodwill.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," provides that goodwill resulting from business combinations completed
subsequent to June 30, 2001 will not be amortized, but instead will be required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement
of operations includes only amortization of those intangible assets with definite lives and no amortization of those intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Deferred taxes arising from
differences between the book and tax basis assigned to intangible assets acquired in the Expedia merger have been recorded. This purchase accounting information is preliminary. To the extent that
additional intangibles are identified, USA will record the amounts and their associated amortization based upon the percentage of Expedia acquired in the transaction. The final allocation of the
acquisition cost could result in additional amortization expense and decreased operating income, net income and earnings per share in subsequent periods. 

3.
Represents
the issuance of 42.9 million shares of USA common stock to Hotels.com security holders in the Hotels merger based on an exchange ratio of 2.4 shares of USA common
stock for each share of Hotels.com common stock. Also includes options to acquire 7.8 million shares of 

USA
common stock and warrants to acquire 5.1 million shares of USA common stock, in each case based on an exchange ratio of 2.4. The price used to value the securities is $26.174, which is the
average of the closing prices of USA common stock on the two trading days prior to, the day of, and the two trading days following, the announcement of the Hotels merger. The amount recorded as
deferred compensation in shareholders' equity is the estimated impact of unvested stock options and warrants as of the merger date, at their fair value. The acquisition costs and resulting goodwill
are as follows: 

(In thousands)

Excess of merger consideration over minority interest acquired and deferred

    compensation preliminarily allocated to goodwill

$

859,668

The
unallocated excess of acquisition costs over minority interest acquired and deferred compensation has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," provides that goodwill resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to June 30, 2001 will not be amortized,
but instead will be required to be tested for impairment at least annually. In order to complete its assessment, USA will obtain an independent valuation related to the identification of intangibles
other than goodwill. Potential
additional intangible assets that may be identified include trade names and trademarks, technology, customer contracts, distribution arrangements and commercial arrangements. Accordingly, the purchase
accounting information is preliminary. To the extent that additional intangibles are identified, USA will record the amounts based upon the percentage of Hotels.com acquired in the transaction. As the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations includes no amortization of intangibles associated with the merger, the final allocation of the acquisition cost could result in
additional amortization expense and decreased operating income, net income and earnings per share in subsequent periods. 

4.
Represents
the issuance of 18.3 million shares of USA common stock to LendingTree security holders in the LendingTree transaction based on an exchange ratio of 0.6199 shares of
USA common stock for each share of LendingTree common stock and 0.67709 shares of USA common stock for each share of LendingTree preferred stock which assumes the closing date of the merger to
be the 31
st
 day of a quarter and that each share of LendingTree preferred stock is convertible into 1.09226 shares of LendingTree common stock immediately prior to the merger.
Also includes options to acquire 3.9 million shares of USA common stock and warrants to acquire 0.1 million shares of USA common stock, in each case based on an exchange ratio of 0.6199.
The price used to value the securities is $33.984, which is the average of the closing prices of USA common stock on the two trading days prior to, the day of, and the two trading days following, the

The
unallocated excess of acquisition costs over minority interest acquired and deferred compensation has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," provides that goodwill resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to June 30, 2001 will not be amortized,
but instead will be required to be tested for impairment at least annually. In order to complete its assessment, USA will obtain an independent valuation related to the identification of intangibles
other than goodwill. Potential additional intangible assets that may be identified include trade names and trademarks, technology, customer contracts, distribution arrangements and commercial
arrangements. Accordingly, the purchase accounting information is preliminary. As the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations includes no amortization of intangibles associated
with the transaction, the final allocation of the acquisition cost could result in additional amortization expense and decreased operating income, net income and earnings per share in subsequent
periods.

CERTAIN USA LITIGATION    

        Following USA's announcement on June 3, 2002 that it intended to commence exchange offers to acquire up to 100% of the outstanding shares of Ticketmaster,
Expedia and Hotels.com that it did not already own, individual stockholders of USA's publicly held subsidiaries filed a number of putative class action complaints against USA, its publicly held
subsidiaries and the boards of directors of its publicly held subsidiaries in the Court of Chancery, County of New Castle, State of Delaware with respect to Ticketmaster and Hotels.com, in the U.S.
District Court for the Central District of California with respect to Ticketmaster, and in King County Superior Court in the State of Washington with respect to Expedia. The complaints generally
alleged that consummation of the exchange offers would be a breach of fiduciary duty and that the indicated exchange ratios were unfair to the minority stockholders of USA's publicly held
subsidiaries. Each of the complaints sought, among other relief, injunctive relief against consummation of the exchange offer, damages in an unspecified amount and rescission in the event the exchange
offer occurred. 

        In
July 2002, the actions with respect to each of the three subsidiaries filed in the states of Delaware and Washington were consolidated, and orders were entered in those actions
providing that the defendants need not respond to the complaint until after the announcement of a transaction contemplating the purchase by USA of the stock of the relevant subsidiary held by its
public minority stockholders. The California complaint was dismissed without prejudice on August 6, 2002. The Washington consolidated action with respect to Expedia was also dismissed without
prejudice on November 22, 2002. On December 16, 2002, the plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated action with respect to Ticketmaster agreed that the defendants have an indefinite amount
of time in which to respond to the complaint, pending a determination by the plaintiffs whether they will proceed with the lawsuit. On January 17, 2003, USA completed its acquisition of all of
the stock of Ticketmaster. 

        On
March 20, 2003, one day after the public announcement that USA and Expedia had entered into a definitive merger agreement, the plaintiffs in the Washington consolidated action
with respect to Expedia filed a purported notice of reinstatement of their claims. On March 20, 2003, three additional purported class actions on behalf of Expedia stockholders were filed in
King County Superior Court in the state of Washington against Expedia, USA, and members of the board of directors of Expedia. Additional purported class action complaints regarding the proposed
transaction involving USA and Expedia were filed on March 24, 2003 and April 2, 2003. These recent complaints allege, in essence, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to
Expedia's public stockholders by entering into and/or approving the merger agreement, which allegedly does not reflect the true value of Expedia. The complaints seek to enjoin consummation of the
transaction or, in the alternative, to rescind the transaction, as well as an unspecified amount of damages. On April 22, 2003, the Washington court entered an order reinstating the
consolidated action. On May 5, 2003, the Washington court entered an order consolidating the five new actions into the reinstated consolidated action. 

        On
April 10, 2003, the day of the public announcement that USA and Hotels.com had entered into a definitive merger agreement, a purported class action on behalf of Hotels.com
stockholders was filed in the Court of Chancery, County of New Castle, State of Delaware, against Hotels.com, USA, and members of the board of directors of Hotels.com. Also on April 10, 2003,
the plaintiff in a purported derivative action on behalf of Hotels.com against various officers and directors of Hotels.com, already pending in the District Court of Dallas, Texas, 160th Judicial
District, filed an amended complaint to include class allegations regarding the Hotels.com merger. This action had been filed prior to the announcement of the Hotels.com merger and originally asserted
derivative claims relating to Hotels.com's pre-merger earnings guidance. The Texas action was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas on
April 18, 2003. The plaintiff in this action filed a motion to remand the case to state court on May 2, 2003. On June 3, 2003, the plaintiff in this action withdrew his motion to
remand and filed a motion for expedited discovery for the purpose of bringing a motion for preliminary injunctive relief in the United States District Court. On April 17, 

2003,
plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated action regarding Hotels.com filed a consolidated and amended class action complaint. The complaints in the Delaware actions, and the class allegations in
the Texas action, allege, in essence, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Hotels.com's public stockholders by entering into and/or approving the merger agreement, which allegedly
does not reflect the true value of Hotels.com. The complaints seek to enjoin consummation of the transaction or, in the alternative, to rescind the transaction, as well as damages in an unspecified
amount. 

        While
USA believes that the allegations in these cases are without merit, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any of these lawsuits. Furthermore, one of the conditions to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between USA and Hotels.com and by the merger agreement between USA and Expedia is that no injunction issued by any court preventing the
consummation of the applicable transactions be in effect. No assurances can be given that these lawsuits will not result in such an injunction being issued, which could prevent or delay the closing of
the transactions contemplated by those merger agreements.

Forest Merger Corp.  

        Forest Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of USA created solely for the purpose of effecting the merger. In the merger, Forest
Merger Corp. will be merged with and into LendingTree, with LendingTree surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of USA. 

COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
  EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION    

Board of Directors  

        The merger agreement provides that the directors of Forest Merger Corp. immediately before the effective time will be the directors of the surviving corporation
upon the merger. Messrs. David Ellen 

and
Michael Adler are the current directors of Forest Merger Corp., and USA expects that they will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation upon the merger. 

        Mr. Ellen,
38, has served as Deputy General Counsel for USA since July 2001 and is a director of Hotels.com and Expedia. Prior to joining USA, Mr. Ellen served as

Executive Officers  

        The merger agreement provides that the officers of LendingTree immediately before the effective time will be the officers of the surviving corporation upon the
merger. We expect that LendingTree's current executive officers will continue to hold such offices in LendingTree immediately before the effective time and will be the executive officers of the
surviving corporation upon the merger. You can find information about LendingTree's current executive officers in LendingTree's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended
December 31, 2002 and LendingTree's proxy statement for its 2003 annual meeting of stockholders. See "Where you Can Find More Information." 

DESCRIPTION OF USA CAPITAL STOCK    

        We set forth below a description of USA's capital stock. The following statements are brief summaries of, and are subject to the provisions of, USA's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, the USA preferred stock certificate of designations, the USA warrant agreements and the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. 

        As
of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the authorized capital stock of USA consists of 1,600,000,000 shares of USA common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 400,000,000 shares
of USA Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of which 13,125,000 shares have been designated Series A Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (which we refer to in this document as the USA preferred stock). 

USA Common Stock and USA Class B Common Stock  

        As of May 15, 2003, there were 457,515,258 shares of USA common stock outstanding and 64,629,996 shares of USA Class B common stock outstanding.
Upon consummation of the merger, based on the number of shares of USA common stock and LendingTree common stock outstanding as of May 15, 2003, there would be outstanding approximately
475,780,538 shares of USA common stock and 64,629,996 shares of USA Class B common stock, without giving effect to USA's proposed acquisition of Expedia, Inc. and Hotels.com. 

        With
respect to matters that may be submitted to a vote or for the consent of USA stockholders, including the election of directors, each holder of USA Class B common stock is
entitled to ten votes for each share of USA Class B common stock held and will vote together with the holders of USA common stock and USA preferred stock as a single class, except as otherwise
required by the DGCL. Each holder of USA preferred stock is entitled to two votes for each share of USA preferred stock held and each holder of USA common stock is entitled to one vote for each share
of USA common stock held. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of USA common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors on the USA board of
directors, and, in the event that 25% of the total number of directors results in a fraction of a director, then the holders of USA common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect the
next higher whole number of directors on the USA board of directors. 

        Shares
of USA Class B common stock are convertible into shares of USA common stock at the option of the holder of the shares at any time on a
share-for-share basis. Such conversion ratio will in all events be equitably preserved in the event of any recapitalization of USA by means of a stock dividend on, or a stock
split or combination of, outstanding USA common stock or USA Class B common stock, or in the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization of USA with another corporation. Upon the
conversion of USA Class B common stock into shares of USA common stock, those shares of USA Class B common stock will be retired and will not be subject to reissue. Shares of USA common
stock are not convertible into shares of USA Class B common stock. 

        In
all other respects, the USA common stock and the USA Class B common stock are identical. The holders of USA common stock and the holders of USA Class B common stock are
entitled to receive, share-for-share, such dividends as may be declared by the USA board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of USA, the holders of USA common stock and the holders of USA Class B common stock are entitled to share ratably in all the assets
of USA available for
distribution to its stockholders, after the rights of the holders of the USA preferred stock, if any, have been satisfied. 

        In
connection with the VUE transaction, USA, Vivendi, Universal, Liberty and Barry Diller entered into an amended and restated governance agreement, which, among other things, retained
Liberty's preemptive right to maintain its percentage equity ownership in USA. This preemptive right generally provides that following issuances of USA common shares exceeding 1% of the total
outstanding USA common shares, Liberty may elect to purchase a number of USA common shares so that its percentage equity interest in USA after such issuances will be the same as before such issuances.
In connection with the merger, Liberty has the right to maintain its percentage equity interest in USA following the merger. On May 13, 2003, Liberty exercised its preemptive rights with
respect to the proposed Expedia merger and the proposed Hotels.com merger. As a result of such exercises, on May 28, 2003 USA issued to Liberty 33,813,169 shares of USA common stock at purchase
prices that were based primarily on the prices of USA common stock around the time of the signings of the Hotels.com merger agreement and the Expedia merger agreement. 

        The
USA certificate of incorporation provides that there can be no stock dividends or stock splits or combinations of stock declared or made on USA common stock or USA Class B
common stock unless the shares of USA common stock and USA Class B common stock then outstanding are treated equally and identically. 

        The
shares of USA common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 

 USA Dividend Policy  

        USA has paid no cash dividends on its common stock to date and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in the immediate future. 

USA Preferred Stock  

        USA may issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series. The USA board of directors has authority, by resolution, to designate the powers,
preferences, rights and qualifications and restrictions of preferred stock of USA. 

 Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  

 General  

        In connection with the USA acquisition of control of Expedia on February 4, 2002, USA issued 13,118,369 shares of USA preferred stock, each having a $50.00
face value and a term of 20 years, of which [13,118,182] are currently outstanding. 

 Voting Rights  

        Holders of USA preferred stock are entitled to two votes for each share of USA preferred stock held on all matters presented to such stockholders. Except as
otherwise required by Delaware law, or any special voting rights of USA preferred stock as described in this document, the holders of USA common stock, USA Class B common stock and USA
preferred stock entitled to vote with the common stockholders will vote together as one class. No separate class vote of USA preferred stock will be required for the approval of any matter except as
required by Delaware law. 

 Dividends  

        Each share of USA preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends equal to the sum of (1) 1.99% of the face value per year, payable quarterly in cash or
USA common stock, at USA's option, plus (2) the excess, if any, of the aggregate value of any dividends paid on the USA common stock underlying the USA preferred stock over the amount described
in (1). If USA elects to pay the dividends in USA common stock, the price will be based on the 10-day trailing average price of USA common stock prior to the payment date. No other
preferred stock of USA will rank senior to the USA preferred stock with respect to payment of dividends. 

 Conversion Rights  

        Each share of USA preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into that number of shares of USA common stock equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing $50.00 by the conversion price per share of USA common stock. The initial conversion price is equal to $33.75 per share of USA common stock. The conversion price will be adjusted downward if
the share price of USA common stock exceeds $35.10 at the time of conversion pursuant to the following formula: 

$50 X (USA)
 (USA X 1.4815) + (0.4792 X (USA - 35.10))

where
USA = 10-day average price of USA common stock for the 10 days prior to the payment date. 

        The
certificate of designations for shares of USA preferred stock also includes an anti-dilution adjustment provision so that the number of shares of USA common stock to be
received upon conversion of a share of USA preferred stock is adjusted from time to time in the event of any stock split, stock consolidation, combination or subdivision, stock dividend or other
distribution and any repurchase, reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of USA. 

 Redemption by USA  

        Commencing on February 4, 2012, the tenth anniversary of the effective time of the USA acquisition of control of Expedia, USA will have the right from time
to time to redeem at least 25% of the original aggregate face value and up to 100% of the original aggregate face value of the outstanding USA
preferred stock at a redemption price per share of USA preferred stock equal to face value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Any payment by USA pursuant to a redemption by USA may be made in cash
or USA common stock, at the option of USA. 

 Redemption by the Holder of USA Preferred Stock  

        During the 20 business day period preceding each of the fifth, seventh, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of February 4, 2002, a holder of USA preferred
stock will have the right to require USA to purchase all or a portion of the shares of USA preferred stock held by such holder for face value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Any payment by USA
pursuant to a redemption by the holder of USA preferred stock may be made in cash or USA common stock, at the option of USA. 

 Liquidation Rights  

        In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of USA, holders of USA preferred stock will be entitled to receive in preference
to any holder of USA common shares an amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends plus the greater of (a) face value, or (b) the liquidating distribution that would be
received had such holder converted the USA preferred stock into USA common stock immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of USA. No other preferred stock of USA will rank
senior to USA preferred stock with respect to payment upon liquidation. 

 Reservation of Shares of USA Common Stock  

        USA will keep in reserve at all times during the term of the USA preferred stock sufficient authorized but unissued shares of USA common stock for issuance in the
event of exercises by the holders of the USA preferred stock. 

 Registration of Shares under the Securities Act  

        The shares of USA preferred stock and any USA common stock issued upon conversion of the USA preferred stock have been registered under the Securities Act. 

 Public Market  

        Shares of the USA preferred stock are traded in the over-the-counter market under the ticker symbol "USAIP.OB." 

Anti-Takeover Provisions in USA's Bylaws  

        USA's bylaws contain provisions that could delay or make more difficult the acquisition of USA by means of a hostile tender offer, open market purchases, a proxy
contest or otherwise. We also refer you to "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to USA" for information on other factors which could impact a change of control. In addition, USA's bylaws
provide that, subject to the rights of holders of the USA preferred stock, only USA's chairman of the board of directors or a majority of USA's board of directors may call a special meeting of
stockholders. 

Effect of Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute  

        USA is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which regulates corporate acquisitions. Section 203 generally prevents corporations from engaging in a
business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless that business combination has been approved in one
of a number of specific ways. For purposes of Section 203, a "business combination" includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving USA and the interested stockholder and a
sale of more than 10% of USA's assets. In general, the anti-takeover law defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of a company's
outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by that entity or person. A Delaware corporation may "opt out" of Section 203 with an express
provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from amendments approved by holders of at least a majority of a
corporation's outstanding voting shares. USA has not "opted out" of the provisions of Section 203. 

Action by Written Consent  

        Under the DGCL, unless a company's certificate of incorporation expressly prohibits action by the written consent of stockholders, any action required or
permitted to be taken by its stockholders at a duly called annual or special meeting may be taken by a consent in writing executed by stockholders possessing the requisite votes for the action to be
taken. USA's certificate of incorporation does not expressly prohibit action by the written consent of stockholders. As a result, Mr. Diller, who as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus controlled (through companies owned by Liberty and Mr. Diller, his own holdings and pursuant to the stockholders agreement described under "Risk FactorsRisk
Factors Relating to USA") a majority of the outstanding total voting power of USA, will be able to take any action to be taken by stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders
of shares of USA common stock of 25% of the members of USA's board of directors and certain matters as to which a separate class vote of the holders of shares of USA common stock, USA Class B
common stock or USA preferred stock is required) without the necessity of holding a stockholders meeting. 

Transfer Agent  

        The transfer agent for the shares of USA common stock is The Bank of New York. 

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS    

        USA and LendingTree are each incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. If we complete the merger, LendingTree stockholders, whose rights are currently
governed by the DGCL, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of LendingTree, and the amended and restated bylaws of LendingTree, will become stockholders of USA, and their rights as
such will be governed by the DGCL, the restated certificate of incorporation of USA, and the amended and restated bylaws of USA. We summarize below the material differences between the rights of
holders of LendingTree capital stock and the rights of holders of USA capital stock, resulting from the differences in their governing documents. 

        The
following summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the rights of holders of USA capital stock under applicable Delaware law, the restated certificate of incorporation
of USA and the amended and restated bylaws of USA or the rights of the holders of LendingTree capital stock under applicable Delaware law, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of
LendingTree and the amended and restated bylaws of LendingTree, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in the summary. This summary contains a list of the material
differences but is not meant to be relied upon as an exhaustive list or a detailed description of the provisions discussed and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL and the governing
corporate instruments of USA and LendingTree. We urge you to read those documents carefully in their entirety. Copies of the applicable governing corporate instruments of USA (as well as the
stockholders agreement and the governance agreement described under "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to USA") and LendingTree are available, without charge, to any person, including any
beneficial owner to whom this proxy statement/prospectus is delivered, by following the instructions listed under "Where You Can Find More Information."

As of May 30, 2003, there were issued and outstanding 23,354,967 shares of LendingTree common stock (with an additional 230,866 shares held in LendingTree's treasury), 5,925,247 shares of LendingTree Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock (with
no shares held in LendingTree's treasury) and no shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (and none held in LendingTree's treasury).

As of May 15, 2003, there were issued and outstanding 457,515,258 shares of USA common stock, 64,629,996 shares of USA Class B common stock and 13,118,182 shares of USA preferred stock.

Voting Power of Capital Stock:

Each share of LendingTree common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of LendingTree Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of LendingTree common stock into which it is convertible under
LendingTree's certificate of incorporation, generally voting together with the LendingTree common stock on all matters submitted for the vote of LendingTree stockholders voting together as a single class. So long as more than 20% of the designated
shares of the LendingTree preferred stock are outstanding, LendingTree is restricted from engaging in certain transactions, including certain modifications of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, without the consent of the holders of at least
68.5% of the shares of LendingTree preferred stock then outstanding.

Each share of USA common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of USA Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and each share of USA preferred stock is entitled to two votes per share, in each case, generally voting
together with the USA common stock on all matters submitted for the vote or consent of USA stockholders, except in cases where the DGCL provides for a separate class vote and except for the election of 25% of the USA board of directors, which is
elected by the holders of the USA common stock. See " Board of Directors." Based on the number of shares of USA Class B common stock outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the holders of USA Class B common stock control
the vote of any matter submitted to USA stockholders voting together as a single class.

Board of Directors:

The LendingTree bylaws provide that the LendingTree board of directors will determine the number of directors by resolution. Currently, the number of directors is eight (including three vacancies as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus),
divided into three classes. The LendingTree charter provides that the number of directors will not be less than three nor more than thirteen. The certificate of designations of the LendingTree preferred stock provides that the size of the board of
directors will not be increased beyond ten without the consent of at least 68.5% of the LendingTree preferred shares then outstanding.

The USA bylaws provide that the USA board of directors will determine the number of directors by resolution. Currently, the number of directors is 16. The USA charter provides that the holders of the USA common stock, acting as a single class, elect
25% of the total number of directors, with the remaining directors elected by the holders of the USA common stock and USA Class B common stock and USA preferred stock voting together as a single class.

Removal of Directors:

Under the DGCL, where the board of directors of the corporation is classified, stockholders may remove directors only for cause unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The LendingTree certificate of incorporation provides that a
director may be removed, subject to the terms of any preferred stock then outstanding, only for cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of LendingTree's then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors.

Under the DGCL, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors is required to remove directors, with or without cause, subject to exceptions that do not apply to USA. The USA bylaws provide that any
director may be removed by the vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of USA capital stock issued and outstanding of the class that elected the director.

Filling Vacancies of the Board of Directors:

The DGCL provides that vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or a sole remaining director, even though less than a quorum, unless the charter or bylaws provide
otherwise. LendingTree's bylaws provide that, subject to the terms of any preferred stock then outstanding, any vacancy on the LendingTree board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of
directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director.

The DGCL provides that vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or a sole remaining director, even though less than a quorum, unless the charter or bylaws provide
otherwise. USA's bylaws also permit holders of a majority of USA's voting power to fill vacancies.

Supermajority Provisions and Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation:

The LendingTree charter provides that a supermajority (80%) vote of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors is required to amend those sections of the charter relating to the management of the corporation, business
combinations, calling of special meetings, action by written consent, bylaw amendments and charter amendments.

The USA charter requires a supermajority (80%) vote of each of the board of directors and the voting power of the stockholders voting as a single class to amend or repeal the requirement that the Chief Executive Officer may only be removed without
cause by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the entire board of directors.

Stockholder Action by Written Consent:

The DGCL provides that unless a corporation otherwise provides in its certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having at least the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote on the matter are present. LendingTree's charter specifically denies stockholders the ability to act by written consent.

The DGCL provides that unless a corporation otherwise provides in its certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having at least the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote on the matter are present. USA's charter does not provide otherwise.

Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders:

The DGCL provides that a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by such person or persons as may be authorized by the certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws. LendingTree's charter and bylaws provide that a
special meeting of stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes by (1) the Chairman of LendingTree's board of directors, (2) LendingTree's Chief Executive Officer, or (3) LendingTree's board of directors. LendingTree's charter
specifically denies stockholders the ability to call a special meeting.

The DGCL provides that a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by such person or persons as may be authorized by the certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws. USA's bylaws provide that a special meeting of
stockholders may be called by USA's Chairman of the board of directors or by a majority of USA's board of directors.

Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders:

The affirmative vote of not less than 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of LendingTree common stock and LendingTree preferred stock, voting together as a single class with the LendingTree preferred
stock voting on an as-converted basis, excluding voting stock beneficially owned by an "interested stockholder" holding 10% or more of such voting power, is required to effect certain business combinations. However, this provision is inapplicable to
a particular business combination where (1) a majority of the continuing directors of LendingTree have approved the transaction or (2) the terms of the business combination meet certain requirements. A "continuing director" refers generally to a
director who is not an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, and who was a member of the board of directors at the time the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder.

USA has no comparable provision.

Stockholder Rights Plan:

LendingTree entered into a Rights Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2000, as amended, with Wachovia Bank, N.A., under which LendingTree has issued rights, exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events, to purchase its Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock.

USA has not adopted a stockholder rights agreement.

LendingTree amended its stockholder rights agreement before entering into the merger agreement to provide that the rights will have no effect upon the consummation of the merger and will no longer be exercisable at or after the effective time of the
merger.

        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 5, 2003 (this "
Agreement
"), by and among USA Interactive, a Delaware corporation
("
Parent
"), Forest Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("
Merger Sub
"), and LendingTree, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "
Company
") (collectively, the "
Parties
"). 

        WHEREAS,
the respective Boards of Directors of each of the Parties have, by unanimous vote, approved and declared advisable this Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub shall merge with
and into the Company (the "
Merger
"), with the Company being the surviving corporation in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions, and with the effects,
set forth in this Agreement; 

        WHEREAS,
as a condition to, and simultaneously with, the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company listed on 
Exhibit A 
are
entering into agreements in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit B 
(the "
Voting Agreements
") with Parent, pursuant to which they have

        (a)
    Cancellation of Certain Company Securities.
    Each share, if any, of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock that is held in the treasury of the Company and all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, if any, that are owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

        (b)

Company Common Stock
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist and shall be converted automatically, subject to
Sections 3.1(d) and 3.2(d), into the right to receive 0.6199 (the "
Exchange Ratio
") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Parent ("
Parent Common Stock
") (such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to Section 3.2(d), collectively are referred to as the "
Common Merger Consideration
").

(ii)
Each
share of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and shares as to which
appraisal rights have been exercised pursuant to Section 3.1(e), shall cease to be outstanding and shall be retired and cease to exist and be converted automatically, subject to
Section 3.2(d), into the right to receive that Common Merger Consideration into which each such share of Company Preferred Stock would have been converted pursuant to

immediately before the Effective Time (the "
Preferred Merger Consideration
" and, together with the Common Merger Consideration, the "
Merger
Consideration
").

(iii)
At
the Effective Time, each Certificate theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Preferred Stock (except as provided in Section 3.1(e)
with respect to shares of Company Preferred Stock as to which appraisal rights have been exercised), as the case may be, shall, without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder
thereof, represent, and shall be deemed to represent from and after the Effective Time, the right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share) as
determined in accordance with Sections 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(b)(ii) above and shall cease to represent any rights in any shares of capital stock of the Company or Surviving Corporation.

thereof, all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("
Merger Sub Common Stock
") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall in the aggregate be converted automatically into (i) a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("
Surviving
Corporation Common Stock
") equal to the excess of 1,000 over the aggregate number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable, as of the Effective Time, pursuant to

Parent Common Stock, Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock split, combination of shares, or any dividend payable in
stock shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock the
same economic effect contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

        (e)
    Appraisal Rights.
    Notwithstanding Section 3.1(b)(ii), shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into the Preferred Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to
appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the Preferred Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Preferred Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Payments to holders of Company Preferred Stock under this Section 3.1(e) shall be made by the Company out of its own
funds, no funds
shall be supplied for that purpose, directly or indirectly, by Parent, nor shall Parent directly or indirectly reimburse the Company for any such payments to holders of Company Preferred Stock. 

        Section 3.2
    Exchange of Certificates.

        (a)
    Deposit with Exchange Agent.
    As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with a bank or trust company selected by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
Exchange Agent
"), pursuant to an agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(b). 

        (b)
    Exchange and Payment Procedures.
    As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (collectively, the "
Certificates
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (collectively, "
Company Securities
") whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent (and which shall be in such form as is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Following the Merger, the former holders of Company Securities shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a book-entry statement reflecting ownership of (or, if requested, a certificate representing) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock then held by such holder) into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock previously represented by such
Certificates are converted in accordance with Section 3.1(b), and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such 

B-4

holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(d). In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to any person who is not the person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate (other than a certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 3.1(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration contemplated by this
Section 3.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to provisions of this Article III. 

        (c)
    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
    No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Parent Common Stock
represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(d) until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

        (d)
    No Fractional Securities.
    In lieu of any fractional securities, each holder of Company Securities who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article III will be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to such holder's respective proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the
aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Article III. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of
(i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
former holders of Company Securities (such excess being collectively called the "
Excess Parent Common Stock
"). The Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of
Company Securities, shall sell the Excess Parent Common Stock at the prevailing prices on Nasdaq (or on the principal exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is then traded or quoted). The sales of
the Excess Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq (or such other exchange) through one or more member firms of Nasdaq (or such other exchange) and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sales of Excess Parent Common Stock. Until the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Company Securities that were
converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash to be paid to former holders of Company Securities in lieu of any fractional interests in shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this Agreement
such amounts to such former holders.

        (e)
    Closing of Transfer Books.
    If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates (or a book-entry position) representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in
Section 3.1 and in this Section 3.2. 

        (f)
    Termination of Exchange Agent.
    Any certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and not exchanged within one year after the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to Parent,
which shall thereafter act as Exchange Agent. All funds or securities held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of two years from the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of such funds or securities to whic
