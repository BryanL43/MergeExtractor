PreliminarySubject to Completion Dated January 15, 2003

PROPOSED MERGERYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT 

Dear Shareholders: 

On
November 24, 2002, MAPICS, Inc. agreed to acquire Frontstep, Inc. by merging a wholly owned subsidiary of MAPICS into Frontstep, after which MAPICS will be the sole shareholder of Frontstep. In the merger, each Frontstep shareholder, other than
those perfecting dissenters rights, will receive, for each Frontstep common share that the shareholder owns, approximately .300846 of a share of MAPICS common stock. Collectively, Frontstep shareholders will receive in the merger 4,200,000
shares of MAPICS common stock. We intend for the merger to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, in which case Frontstep shareholders generally would not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange in the
merger of Frontstep common shares for MAPICS common stock. 

The merger requires the approval of Frontstep
shareholders. The issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger requires the approval of MAPICS shareholders. MAPICS and Frontstep have each scheduled shareholder meetings on February 18, 2003, to vote on these matters. MAPICS
shareholders, who will vote on the merger at the MAPICS annual meeting, will also vote on the election of certain directors and on an increase in the number of shares of its common stock reserved for grants pursuant to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. Regardless of the number of shares that you own or whether you plan to attend a meeting, it is important that your shares be represented and voted. Voting instructions are inside. 

The MAPICS board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and
the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, MAPICS and its shareholders. Accordingly, the MAPICS board of directors unanimously recommends that MAPICS shareholders vote to approve the issuance of MAPICS common stock in the
merger. The MAPICS board of directors also has unanimously recommended approval of the re-election of its two Class III directors and the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These proposals are more fully described in this joint
proxy statement-prospectus. 

The Frontstep board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the
merger agreement and declared that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Frontstep and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Frontstep board of directors unanimously recommends that Frontstep
shareholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The merger agreement must be adopted and the merger must be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares. As of the Frontstep record
date, holders of approximately 60.90% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares have agreed to vote their common shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

This document provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger. We encourage you to read the entire document carefully.

MAPICS common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol MAPX. 

Frontstep common shares are traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol FSTP.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER 

We intend the following questions and answers to
provide brief answers to frequently asked questions about the merger. These questions and answers do not, and are not intended to, address all questions that may be important to shareholders of MAPICS or Frontstep. You should read all of the
questions and answers, the summary and the rest of this joint proxy statement-prospectus carefully. 

Q:

Why are MAPICS and Frontstep proposing the merger? 

A:

MAPICS and Frontstep are proposing the merger because they believe it will create one of the worlds leading providers of enterprise resource planning,
customer relationship management and supply chain management applications committed to solving the unique challenges of discrete and batch process manufacturers. The combined company, with products implemented at thousands of customer sites
worldwide, will be in a position to deliver more effectively its technological innovations and business solutions. By combining these two businesses, MAPICS and Frontstep hope to create stronger operating and financial results than either company
could achieve on its own. 

Q:

What will Frontstep shareholders receive in the merger? 

A:

Each Frontstep common share will be converted into the right to receive approximately .300846 of a share of MAPICS common stock and associated rights under
MAPICS amended and restated rights agreement, as amended. This exchange ratio is determined by dividing the aggregate 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger by the total number of Frontstep common shares
outstanding at the time the merger is completed. Collectively, Frontstep shareholders will hold approximately 19% of the outstanding shares of MAPICS common stock immediately following the merger. 

Q:

Is the merger taxable? 

A:

Prior to completion of the merger, MAPICS and Frontstep must have received opinions from their tax counsel that Frontstep shareholders will not recognize any
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon their exchange of Frontstep common shares for shares of MAPICS common stock pursuant to the merger. Frontstep shareholders may, however, recognize taxable gain or loss related to any cash they
receive in lieu of a fractional share of MAPICS common stock and any cash they receive upon the exercise of dissenters rights.You should consult your tax advisor to determine the effect of the merger on you under federal, state, local and
foreign tax laws. 

Q:

Am I entitled to dissenters rights? 

A:

If you are a Frontstep shareholder, under Ohio law, you may dissent from the merger and exercise dissenters rights. For more information about exercising
your dissenters rights, see The MergerRights of Dissenting Shareholders. 

If you are a MAPICS shareholder, you will not have appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Q:

Are there risks associated with the merger that I should consider in deciding how to vote? 

A:

Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the proposed merger. See Risk Factors. 

Q:

What vote is required to approve the merger? 

A:

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at MAPICS annual meeting is required to approve the issuance of MAPICS common stock in the merger.
Additionally, the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares is required to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. See The Shareholder MeetingsVote Required. 

Q:

What do I need to do now? 

A:

After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, please complete, sign and date your proxy card and
return it in the enclosed postage paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your shareholder meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you will receive instructions on how to vote
from your brokerage firm or bank. 

-i- 



Q:

What if I dont vote? 

A:

If you are a MAPICS shareholder and fail to respond, assuming a quorum is present at the annual meeting, your failure to respond will have no effect on the
approval of the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, the election of the MAPICS directors, or the approval of the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. If you are a MAPICS shareholder and abstain from voting,
assuming a quorum is present at the annual meeting, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger and against the amendment of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. If you
withhold authority to vote on the election of directors, it will have no effect on the election of directors. In the event that you respond but do not indicate how you want to vote and you are a MAPICS shareholder, your proxy will be counted as a
vote in favor of the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock, the election of the MAPICS directors and the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan at the MAPICS annual meeting. 

If you are a Frontstep shareholder and fail to respond or abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.
In the event that you respond but do not indicate how you want to vote, and you are a Frontstep shareholder, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger at the Frontstep special
meeting. 

Q:

Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card? 

A:

Yes. You can change your vote in one of three ways at any time before your shares are voted at your meeting. First, you can revoke your proxy. Second, you can
submit a new proxy card. If you choose either of these two methods, you must mail your notice of revocation or your new proxy card to the secretary of either MAPICS or Frontstep, as appropriate, before your shareholder meeting. Third, if you are a
holder of record, you can attend your shareholder meeting and vote in person. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your vote. 

Q:

When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A:

MAPICS and Frontstep are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. MAPICS and Frontstep expect to complete the merger on or about February 18,
2003. 

Q:

If I am a Frontstep shareholder, should I send in my Frontstep share certificates now? 

A:

No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions, including a letter of transmittal, that explains how to exchange your Frontstep share
certificates for stock certificates representing MAPICS common stock. Please do not send in any Frontstep share certificates until you receive these written instructions and the letter of transmittal. 

Q:

Who can help answer my questions? 

A:

If you have any questions about the merger or how to vote your shares, or if you need additional copies of this joint proxy statement-prospectus or the enclosed
proxy card, you should contact:

In the merger, Frontstep shareholders
will receive approximately .300846 of a share of MAPICS common stock for each Frontstep common share, together with associated rights under MAPICS amended and restated rights agreement, as



amended. This exchange ratio is determined by dividing the aggregate 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger by the total number of Frontstep common shares
outstanding at the time the merger is completed. 

Comparative Market Prices of MAPICS Common Stock and Frontstep Common Shares
(See page 79) 

MAPICS common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
MAPX. Frontstep common shares are listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol FSTP. The following table shows the closing prices of MAPICS common stock and Frontstep common shares on November 22, 2002, the last
trading day before the merger agreement was announced, and on January 15, 2003, the last trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Equivalent price per Frontstep share represents the closing sale price of a share
of MAPICS common stock on the indicated date multiplied by .300846, the assumed exchange ratio, as if the merger were to close on the indicated date.

We urge Frontstep shareholders to obtain current market
quotations for MAPICS common stock and Frontstep common shares before making a decision relating to the merger. 

Material Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (See page 62) 

Prior to the completion of the merger, MAPICS must
have received the opinion of Alston & Bird LLP and Frontstep must have received the opinion of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP regarding material federal income tax consequences of the merger. 

We expect that, for federal income tax purposes, Frontstep shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss upon their exchange of
Frontstep common shares for shares of MAPICS common stock pursuant to the merger. Frontstep shareholders may, however, recognize taxable gain or loss related to any cash they receive in lieu of a fractional share of MAPICS common stock, and any cash
they receive upon the perfection of any dissenters rights. 

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax
consequences of the merger to Frontstep shareholders will depend on the facts and circumstances of each shareholders ownership of Frontstep common shares. Each Frontstep shareholder should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the
effect on such shareholder of the merger under federal, state, local and foreign tax laws. 

Recommendation of the Boards of
Directors and Fairness Opinions (See page 60) 

To MAPICS
Shareholders
:    The MAPICS board of directors believes that the merger is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, MAPICS and its shareholders and has unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement. The MAPICS
board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger. 

To Frontstep Shareholders
:    The Frontstep board of directors believes that the merger is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Frontstep and its shareholders and has unanimously voted to
approve, adopt and declare the advisability of the merger agreement and the merger. The Frontstep board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Opinion of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:
    In deciding to approve the merger and recommend the issuance of
shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, the MAPICS board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor, SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., trading under the name SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, that as of November 24, 2002, the
consideration to be paid by MAPICS in connection with the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to MAPICS. SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion is directed to the MAPICS



board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how to vote on the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger or any other matter related
thereto. The full text of SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. MAPICS shareholders are urged to read SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion carefully and in its entirety for a
description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. 

Opinion of William Blair & Company, L.L.C.:

In connection with the proposed merger, William Blair has delivered a written opinion to the
Frontstep board of directors as to the fairness to holders of outstanding Frontstep common shares, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger. In deciding to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to
recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by Frontstep shareholders, the Frontstep board of directors considered the opinion of William Blair. The full text of William Blairs written opinion, dated November 24, 2002, is attached to
this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annex D. We encourage you to read William Blairs opinion carefully and in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken. William Blairs opinion is addressed to the Frontstep board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to any matter relating to the merger or any other matter related thereto. 

Effect of the Merger on Frontstep Options (See page 61) 

In the merger, all options granted under Frontsteps stock option plans which are outstanding at the effective time of the merger, whether or not currently
exercisable, will be converted into options to purchase MAPICS common stock. All Frontstep options will vest and become fully exercisable by their terms at the effective time of the merger. MAPICS will assume each Frontstep option in accordance with
the terms of the Frontstep stock option plan and stock option agreement that evidences the option, after adjusting the option shares and exercise price to give effect to the exchange ratio. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (See page 64) 

Some of the directors and executive officers of Frontstep have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Frontstep shareholders. These interests include the acceleration of vesting of
options as a result of the merger, payments under employment and change-in-control agreements upon the occurrence of certain events after the merger, the right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by Frontstep after the merger and the
payoff or assumption by MAPICS of certain Frontstep debt owed to Frontsteps affiliates. 

Rights of Dissenting Shareholders
(See page 69) 

The merger agreement and Ohio law provide that Frontstep shareholders may dissent from the
merger and seek to receive the fair cash value of their Frontstep common shares in lieu of the MAPICS common stock they would otherwise receive in the merger. 

In order to exercise dissenters rights, Frontstep shareholders are required to follow the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code, a copy of which is attached as Annex E
to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Generally, a Frontstep shareholder wishing to exercise dissenters rights must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Frontstep, not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
the merger and hold his or her Frontstep common shares until the completion of the merger. Frontstep shareholders should carefully review Section 1701.85 for a more complete discussion of the procedures that they must follow in order to exercise
dissenters rights. 

Certain Differences in Shareholders Rights (See page 72) 

The rights of MAPICS shareholders are governed by Georgia law and by MAPICS articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights of
Frontstep shareholders are governed by Ohio law and are subject to Frontsteps amended articles of incorporation and amended code of regulations. Upon completion of the merger, the rights of both shareholder groups will be governed by Georgia
law and MAPICS articles of incorporation and bylaws. 



Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See page 56) 

The merger will be completed only if various conditions, including the following, are met or waived, if waivable: 



Frontstep shareholders approve the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement at the Frontstep special meeting; 



MAPICS shareholders approve the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger at the MAPICS annual meeting; 



Frontstep and MAPICS receive opinions of their respective counsel that the exchange of Frontstep common shares for MAPICS common stock in the merger will be
tax-free to Frontstep shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 



there is no governmental or regulatory action or legislation prohibiting the merger; 



there must not have been any event that, individually or together with any other event, has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on
MAPICS or Frontstep; 



the aggregate indebtedness of Frontstep and its subsidiaries must not be in excess of $21.5 million immediately prior to the closing of the merger; and



holders of no more than 5% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares must have perfected their dissenters rights. 

MAPICS and Frontstep are not aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger.

In addition to these conditions, the merger agreement, attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annex
A, describes other conditions that must be met before the merger may be completed. 

Amendment and Termination (See page 58)

The parties may terminate the merger agreement under several circumstances. MAPICS and Frontstep may
agree to terminate the merger agreement and elect not to complete the merger at any time before the merger is completed, even if Frontstep shareholders have already adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger and MAPICS shareholders have
approved the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger. Each of the parties also can terminate the merger agreement under other circumstances, including: 



if the merger is not completed by April 30, 2003; 



if the parties fail to receive the consent of any regulatory authority required to complete the merger, or any law or order permanently prohibiting the merger
becomes final and nonappealable; 



if Frontstep shareholders fail to approve the merger and to adopt the merger agreement or MAPICS shareholders fail to approve the issuance of shares of MAPICS
common stock in the merger at their respective meetings, subject to specified limitations in the merger agreement; 



if there is a material breach of a covenant by the other party which cannot or has not been cured within a certain time period; or 



if there has been any event that, individually or together with any other event, has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the other
party. 

In addition, MAPICS may terminate the merger agreement, among other things, if the
Frontstep board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation of the merger or withdraws, qualifies or modifies in a manner adverse to MAPICS its recommendation of the merger, or publicly proposes to do so. 

The merger agreement may be amended by the written agreement of MAPICS and Frontstep. The parties can amend the merger agreement without
shareholder approval, even if Frontstep shareholders have already adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger and MAPICS shareholders have already approved the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock, except in the limited circumstances
when further shareholder approval is required by law for the amendment. 



Solicitation Prohibitions (See page 61) 

The merger agreement prohibits Frontstep from soliciting other acquisition proposals. Frontstep and its subsidiaries agreed to immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with third parties conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal. If Frontstep receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal, it must
promptly notify MAPICS of the proposals material terms. Frontstep may respond, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, to unsolicited acquisition proposals that constitute superior proposals (as this term is defined in the merger
agreement). 

Termination Fee (See page 63) 

Frontstep has agreed to pay MAPICS a termination fee of $1.5 million plus the amount of MAPICS reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the merger
if: 



the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances and Frontstep enters into an acquisition agreement or closes an acquisition with another party
within twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement; 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because Frontstep shareholders have not approved the merger and adopted the merger agreement; 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because the Frontstep board of directors changes, withdraws or fails to reaffirm its recommendation that Frontstep
shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because the Frontstep board of directors negotiates or authorizes negotiations with a third party regarding an
acquisition proposal other than the merger; or 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because any person acquires beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Frontstep common shares. 

See The Merger  Expenses and Fees for a more complete discussion of circumstances
under which Frontstep would be required to pay the termination fee to MAPICS. 

Shareholder Agreements (See page 70)

All of the directors, executive officers and certain shareholders of Frontstep have entered into
shareholder agreements with MAPICS where they have agreed to vote the Frontstep common shares that they or certain of their affiliates own or later acquire in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. As of the record
date for the Frontstep special meeting, these shareholders owned approximately 60.90% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares. 

Distribution of MAPICS Stock Certificates (See page 55) 

Promptly after the merger is
completed, each Frontstep shareholder will receive a letter and instructions on how to surrender Frontstep share certificates in exchange for MAPICS stock certificates. Each Frontstep shareholder will need to carefully review and complete these
materials and return them as instructed along with their Frontstep share certificates. 
If you are a Frontstep shareholder, please do not send to Frontstep or Frontsteps transfer agent any certificates until you receive these
instructions.
 If, as a Frontstep shareholder, you elect to exercise your dissenters rights, you should follow the procedures outlined in The Merger  Rights of Dissenting Shareholders. 

Accounting Treatment (See page 63) 

MAPICS will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting. 

PROPOSAL
2:    ELECTION OF MAPICS DIRECTORS 

At the MAPICS annual meeting, the terms of
MAPICS two Class III directors will expire, and MAPICS shareholders will be asked to vote on the election of their replacements. The MAPICS board of directors has nominated Terry H. Osborne and H. Mitchell Watson, Jr. to be re-elected at the
annual meeting as the Class III directors. If re-elected, they will each serve three year terms to expire at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders. The MAPICS board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the re-election of Terry H.
Osborne and H. Mitchell Watson, Jr. as Class III directors. 

See page 81 for more information regarding
this proposal. 



PROPOSAL 3:    AMENDMENT OF THE MAPICS 1998
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 

MAPICS currently maintains the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which
stock options and other incentive awards may be granted to MAPICS employees, officers, consultants and directors. The MAPICS board of directors has unanimously approved increasing the number of shares of MAPICS common stock available for
grants under the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan from 4,500,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares and to make certain other amendments described in Proposal 3. Without the amendment, there were, as of January 3, 2003, only 421,964 shares
remaining for awards under the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The MAPICS board of directors believes the increase is necessary to provide appropriate incentives to MAPICS current and future employees, including those Frontstep employees
who will become MAPICS employees following the merger. If MAPICS shareholders do not approve the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, MAPICS will not seek an increase in the number of shares available for grants under the
MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan at the annual meeting. The MAPICS board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the amendment of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

See page 83 for more information regarding this proposal.

Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 

The following table presents selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of MAPICS for the fiscal year ended
and as of September 30, 2002 which gives effect to the merger with Frontstep using the purchase method of accounting as if the merger occurred on October 1, 2001 for the statement of operations data and as of September 30, 2002 for the balance sheet
data. The condensed combined statement of operations has been prepared using the Consolidated Statement of Operations for MAPICS for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and the Consolidated Statement of Operations for Frontstep for its
fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. In fiscal year 2002, MAPICS recorded an extraordinary item of $318,000, after taxes due to the early termination of its term loan. This amount has been excluded from the historical and pro forma presentations below.
The following table should be read in conjunction with MAPICS unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information on page 95 of this joint proxy statement-prospectus and the historical consolidated financial statements and the related
notes thereto of MAPICS and Frontstep included in the documents attached as Annexes F and G to this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the other information included in this document, you should
consider the risk factors described below in determining how to vote at your shareholder meeting. 

Risks Associated with the Merger 

Any failure of MAPICS and Frontstep to
successfully manage the challenges of their integration may result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the merger. 

MAPICS and Frontstep will face challenges in consolidating functions, retaining key personnel and integrating their organizations, procedures, operations and product lines
in a timely and efficient manner. These challenges will result principally because the two companies currently: 



maintain executive offices in different locations; 



market and sell different products through different distribution channels; 



conduct their businesses from various locations and under different procedures; 



maintain different systems and software on different computer hardware; and 



have different employment and compensation arrangements for their employees. 

As a result, the integration of MAPICS and Frontstep will be complex and will require additional attention from members of management. The diversion of management attention
and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company. 

The combined companys debt level may limit its financial flexibility. 

In order to finance the acquisition of Frontstep and to fund continuing operations for the combined company, MAPICS intends to secure a new credit facility allowing for
borrowings of approximately $35.0 million. This credit facility will likely contain a number of financial and operating performance covenants that MAPICS will have to satisfy for the term of the bank credit facility. MAPICS ability to satisfy
these covenants and to service debt that it incurs under the bank credit facility depends principally upon MAPICS ability to achieve positive operating performance and to successfully manage working capital to support cash flow requirements.
If MAPICS quarterly operating performance falls substantially below expectations, or if MAPICS is not able to effectively manage collection efforts or cash expenditures in a given quarter, MAPICS may not be able to fully support its cash flow
requirements. 

MAPICS will likely secure its obligations under the bank credit facility by pledging
substantially all of its assets in the United States as collateral. Additionally, MAPICS expects that all of its domestic subsidiaries, including Frontstep after the merger, will be required to guarantee the repayment of MAPICS obligations
under the bank credit facility and that MAPICS will pledge a majority of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries to the lenders. Any breach of the financial covenants or MAPICS inability to satisfy the debt service requirements could
result in a default under the bank credit facility and an acceleration of payment of all outstanding debt owed, which could materially and adversely effect MAPICS business. 

As of September 30, 2002, MAPICS had no outstanding debt. After giving effect to the acquisition of Frontstep, including MAPICS intended financing of the repayment of
Frontsteps existing indebtedness and direct costs associated with the acquisition, as of September 30, 2002, the combined company would have had approximately $19.9 million of total debt and a total debt to total capital ratio of 43% on a pro
forma basis. The



combined company also may incur additional debt in the future, including in connection with other acquisitions. The level of the combined companys debt could have several important effects
on the combined companys future operations, including, among others: 



an increased portion of the combined companys cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the debt and will
not be available for other purposes; 



covenants related to the debt that MAPICS intends to incur in connection with the merger will require the combined company to meet financial tests that may
affect the combined companys flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in its business, including possible acquisition opportunities; 



the combined companys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes
may be limited; 



the combined company may be at a competitive disadvantage to similar companies that have less debt; and 



the combined companys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may increase. 

The directors and executive officers of Frontstep have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, other
Frontstep shareholders. These interests include: 



options to purchase Frontstep common shares, including any stock option held by any executive officer of Frontstep, will become fully exercisable and converted
into options to acquire MAPICS common stock; 



all of Frontsteps executive officers have agreements with Frontstep that provide for severance payments (and continued insurance coverage) that may be
triggered upon termination of their employment after completion of the merger; 



directors and executive officers of Frontstep have customary rights to indemnification against specified liabilities, and directors and officers
liability insurance will be maintained for them; 



certain directors and officers of Frontstep may, in connection with or following the merger, enter into consulting or employment agreements with MAPICS which
provide them with benefits not available to other Frontstep shareholders; and 



certain directors of Frontstep or their affiliates hold unsecured, subordinated notes issued by Frontstep that will either be repaid upon completion of the
merger or will be replaced by new notes with different terms. 

See The
MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger and The MergerEffect of the Merger on Frontstep Options. 

If the merger does not occur, MAPICS and Frontstep will not benefit from the expenses they have incurred in the pursuit of the merger. 

The merger may not be completed. If the merger is not completed, MAPICS and Frontstep will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been
received by either MAPICS or Frontstep. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Frontstep will be required to pay MAPICS a $1.5 million termination fee plus the amount of MAPICS reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the merger. See The MergerExpenses and Fees. 



Risks Associated with an Investment in MAPICS Common Stock 

If MAPICS is unable
to react effectively to various factors outside its control, MAPICS operating results could be adversely impacted and its quarterly results could fluctuate significantly. 

MAPICS future success depends on a number of factors, many of which are unpredictable and beyond its control. Moreover, many of these factors are likely to cause
MAPICS operating results, cash flows and liquidity to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. These factors include, among others: 



the size and timing of license transactions because license revenue in any quarter depends substantially on the number and size of orders booked and shipped to
customers in that quarter; 



the proportion of revenue attributable to fees for licenses compared to fees for services; 



renewal rates for our annual license and support agreements; 



the proportion of products MAPICS licenses that are developed by MAPICS versus those developed solely by a third party or in collaboration with a third party;



how much money MAPICS must spend to improve its business and expand operations; 



changes in the level of operating expenses; 



delays in the purchase of products and services by customers due to their capital expenditure limitations and the time they often require to authorize purchases
of MAPICS products and services; 



the demand for MAPICS products and services; 



whether customers accept the new and enhanced products and services MAPICS offers; 



how quickly MAPICS is able to develop or acquire new products and services that its customers require; 



whether and how quickly alternative technologies, products and services introduced by competitors gain market acceptance; 



the timing of the introduction of new or enhanced products offered by competitors or by MAPICS; 



the ability of MAPICS sales affiliates to sell products or service additional sales; 



the competitive conditions in this industry; 



whether MAPICS and its business partners are able to hire and retain qualified personnel; 



management of fixed price contracts to deliver services; 



compliance with domestic and international tax regulations and treaties; 



foreign exchange risk; 



foreign trade agreements; and 



prevailing conditions in the enterprise application marketplace and other general economic and political factors. 

Due to one or more of these factors, MAPICS operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or
investors. If that happens, the price of MAPICS common stock could decline materially. 

The market for
business software in the mid-sized manufacturing industry is highly competitive, and MAPICS may be unable to increase, or even maintain, its market share. 

The market for business software in the mid-sized manufacturing industry is highly competitive and changes rapidly. The market activities of industry participants, such as
new product introductions, frequently result in



increased competition. MAPICS competitors offer a variety of products for its target market as well as similar markets. MAPICS primarily competes with a large number of independent software
vendors, including: 



EPICOR; 



Geac Computer Corporation Limited; 



Industrial & Financial Systems, AB; 



Intentia AB; 



i2 Technologies; 



J.D. Edwards & Company, Inc.; 



Manugistics, Inc.; 



Oracle Corporation; 



QAD, Inc.; 



SAP AG; and 



SSA Global Technologies. 

MAPICS also competes with vendors of specialized applications. MAPICS may be unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. 

To be successful in the future, MAPICS must respond promptly and effectively to changes in technology. MAPICS also must respond to its competitors innovations. Some
of MAPICS competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, service, support and technical resources than MAPICS. Some of these competitors also have greater name recognition than MAPICS. Accordingly, these competitors may be able
to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They also may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products. 

MAPICS expects to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for business software and as new products and technologies
are introduced. In addition, current and potential competitors may make acquisitions or establish alliances among themselves or with others. These acquisitions or alliances could increase the ability of competitors products to address the
needs of MAPICS current or prospective customers. As a result, new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain a significant share of the enterprise application market. For MAPICS, this could result
in fee reductions, the loss of current or prospective customers, fewer customer orders, and reduced revenue. In addition, MAPICS principally relies on a network of affiliates for the implementation of its products. If the affiliates fail to maintain
sufficiently high quality standards, MAPICS reputation and competitive position could weaken. Any or all of these events could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If MAPICS doesnt respond to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards, MAPICS will be unable to
compete effectively. 

The market for enterprise software products is constantly changing. These changes
include, among others: 



rapid technological advances; 



evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology; 



changes in customer requirements; and 



frequent new product introductions and enhancements. 



MAPICS future success depends upon its ability to continue to enhance its
products, as well as MAPICS ability to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. In particular, MAPICS must
anticipate and respond adequately to advances in the functionality of standard business applications software and Internet technology to deploy these systems. If MAPICS merges with Frontstep, MAPICS future success will also depend on its
ability to develop, market and sell Frontsteps products, particularly Frontsteps new SyteLine 7.0 offering. MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if MAPICS is
unable to develop and market new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost-effective basis. 

As a result of the high level of functionality and performance demanded by enterprise software customers, major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods. Despite testing,
however, the complex enterprise software programs MAPICS offers may contain errors that customers discover only after the programs have been installed and used. Undetected errors may impair the market acceptance of MAPICS products or adversely
affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. Problems encountered by customers installing and implementing MAPICS new products or releases or using MAPICS new products, including product functionality,
product response time and program errors, also could adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Because MAPICS quarterly product licensing activity is concentrated toward the end of each quarter, MAPICS may not accurately predict future licensing activity, cash flows, and revenues
that will be available to offset planned expenses. 

MAPICS product licensing occurs predominantly in
the third month of each quarter and tends to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month. As a result, MAPICS quarterly licensing activity, cash flows and revenues are difficult to predict. Delays in product delivery or in closings
of sales near the end of a quarter could cause MAPICS quarterly results to fall short of the levels MAPICS anticipates. Moreover, MAPICS establishes spending levels based on expected future operating results. If results of operations are less
than anticipated, MAPICS may not be able to reduce spending levels proportionately. As a consequence, MAPICS operating results, cash flows and liquidity would be adversely affected. 

MAPICS future revenue is substantially dependent upon its installed customer base. 

MAPICS depends and will continue to depend on its installed customer base for additional future revenue from services, support and maintenance, and licensing of additional
products. MAPICS license, maintenance and support agreements generally are renewable annually at the option of the customer. There can be no assurance that current installed customers will renew their maintenance and support agreements in
future periods, continue to use MAPICS or its affiliates for professional services or to purchase additional products from MAPICS, any of which could have a material adverse effect on MAPICS future financial results and financial condition.

If MAPICS is unable to complete successful acquisitions, MAPICS will be unable to grow its business as
planned. 

As part of its business strategy, MAPICS continually evaluates potential acquisitions of
complementary technologies, products and businesses. MAPICS planned acquisition of Frontstep is an example of such potential strategic combinations. In its pursuit of additional acquisitions, MAPICS may be unable to: 



identify suitable acquisition candidates; 



compete for acquisitions with other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than MAPICS; 



obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions; 



complete the acquisitions on terms favorable to MAPICS; 



integrate acquired technologies, products and businesses into MAPICS existing operations; and 



profitably manage acquired technologies, products and businesses. 



Acquisitions that MAPICS may undertake in the future involve a number of risks.
Some of these risks are that: 



technologies, products or businesses that MAPICS acquires may not perform as expected; 



technologies, products or businesses that MAPICS acquires may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability or productivity comparable to MAPICS existing
technologies, products and operations; 



acquisitions may adversely affect MAPICS results of operations; 



acquisitions may divert the attention of MAPICS management and resources; 



MAPICS may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and personnel; 



MAPICS may experience difficulty in retaining, hiring and training key personnel; and 



MAPICS may experience difficulty retaining customers of the acquired businesses. 

Any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition or results of operations. 

If MAPICS is unable to work effectively with other software companies, MAPICS product development and enhancement efforts will
suffer. 

Many of MAPICS applications were developed by solution partners, and MAPICS expects to
continue to rely on solution partners for the development of additional applications. Generally, solution partners continue to own the rights to, and to maintain the technology underlying, the applications but license the technology to MAPICS. Under
a license agreement with a solution partner, MAPICS ordinarily is obligated to pay a royalty to the solution partner for sales of the applications developed by the solution partner. MAPICS also may develop alliances with, and jointly market products
offered by, third parties. If MAPICS fails to pay the required royalty when due or otherwise breaches the agreements, the solution partner may terminate the agreement. The unwillingness of a solution partner to renew its agreement or the termination
of an agreement with a solution partner could adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations
. 

MAPICS success depends in part on MAPICS continued ability to license applications from solution partners. However, solution partners may not be available to develop or support applications
for us in the future. Even if available, solution partners may not complete applications for MAPICS on a timely basis and within acceptable guidelines. Accordingly, MAPICS may not be able to make available applications from solution partners that
are acceptable in the market. 

While many of MAPICS solution partner agreements grant MAPICS exclusive
rights to its customers, a solution partner also may have or develop a relationship with MAPICS existing or prospective customers or affiliates. The solution partner may use this relationship to become a competitor. If a solution partner is
already a competitor, it may use this relationship to enhance its competitive position. The solution partner could, as a competitor or otherwise, cause MAPICS to lose existing or prospective customers. The occurrence of any of the events described
above could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If MAPICS acquires Frontstep, termination of Frontsteps agreement with Progress Software Corporation would cause a disruption of service to Frontsteps customers and may result in lower operating margins or a loss of
business. 

Frontsteps enterprise applications, SyteLine, through Version 6.0, is written in
Progress, a proprietary programming language licensed from Progress Software Corporation. Frontstep markets and distributes Progress in connection with the sale of its products under a non-exclusive agreement with Progress Software Corporation. The
agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party. If the agreement is terminated, it could disrupt MAPICS marketing and customer support operations and could result in a loss of customers, revenue, earnings
and cash flow.



Frontsteps relationship with Progress Software Corporation involves other risks which could have a material adverse effect on MAPICS business, operating results or financial
condition, including the following: 



the failure of Progress Software Corporation to support current Progress customers in a manner that is competitive with enhancements of other programming
languages; and 



Frontsteps inability to migrate its software products to other programming languages on a timely basis if Progress is no longer available. 

MAPICS inability to protect its proprietary rights and avoid claims that it infringes the
proprietary rights of others could materially harm MAPICS business. 

MAPICS success greatly
depends upon the protection of MAPICS proprietary software. MAPICS relies on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as license and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect proprietary rights in products
and information. To further protect these rights, MAPICS 



enters into confidentiality and/or license agreements with employees, distributors, contractors, customers and potential customers; and 



limits access to and distribution of software, documentation and other proprietary information. 

Despite these precautions, an unauthorized person could copy or reverse-engineer some portions of MAPICS products or obtain and use proprietary
information. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, MAPICS cannot assure you that the steps it takes to protect its software will be
adequate. Moreover, MAPICS competitors may independently develop software products that are substantially equivalent or superior to MAPICS software products. 

MAPICS may receive notices claiming that MAPICS is infringing the proprietary rights of others. Third parties also could institute legal proceedings against MAPICS claiming
that its current or future products infringe their proprietary rights. Alternatively, MAPICS may make claims or initiate litigation against others for infringement of its proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights. Any
claims against MAPICS, with or without merit, or claims by MAPICS against others could be time consuming and expensive to defend, prosecute or resolve. In addition, these claims could cause product shipment delays or force MAPICS to enter into
royalty or license agreements to resolve the claims. Moreover, an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could 



subject MAPICS to significant liabilities; 



require MAPICS to allocate significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; 



require disputed rights to be licensed from others; or 



prohibit MAPICS from using specific marketing materials or products. 

If MAPICS is required to license proprietary rights from others or wishes to do so, MAPICS cannot assure you that the necessary licenses will be available on acceptable terms. One or more of these
events could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

MAPICS stock price may fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect the trading of its common stock. 

The market price of MAPICS common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future. Various factors and events have caused this fluctuation and
are likely to cause the fluctuations to continue. These factors include, among others: 



developments related to the proposed merger with Frontstep; 



quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results; 





the depth and liquidity of the trading market for MAPICS common stock; 



the growth rate of MAPICS revenue; 



changes by securities analysts in estimates regarding MAPICS; 



conditions in the enterprise software industry; 



the condition of the stock market; 



actions by MAPICS competitors; 



regulatory actions; and 



general economic conditions. 

In addition, from time to time the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Stock market fluctuations have particularly affected the stock prices of technology companies, including MAPICS. These
fluctuations may be unrelated to operating performance. Furthermore, MAPICS operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. Any such event could cause the market price of
MAPICS common stock to decline materially. 

An economic downturn in the worldwide manufacturing
industry may adversely affect MAPICS financial results. 

MAPICS business depends substantially
upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers. In turn, these expenditures depend in part upon the demand for these manufacturers products. The ongoing recession affecting the worldwide manufacturing industry could cause manufacturers in
MAPICS target market to reduce or postpone capital expenditures for business information systems. This change in the amount or timing of capital expenditures by manufacturers could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Industries in which MAPICS customers operate have been
affected by weakened demand for their products for approximately one to two years. MAPICS believes that as a result, the demand for its products and services has been significantly impacted, which has negatively affected MAPICS financial
results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that economic conditions relating to MAPICS customers or potential customers will not become more severe. 

Customer related claims, whether successful or not, could be expensive and could harm MAPICS business. 

MAPICS products are generally used to manage data critical to large organizations. These organizations also share this critical data
with others in their value chain using the Internet or other networks. There are many security risks inherent with making data available over a network and in sharing data with third parties, and MAPICS products are not designed to safeguard
against all such risks. MAPICS occasionally delivers implementation services to its customers. As a result, MAPICS development, sale, implementation service and support of products may entail the risk of product liability claims. MAPICS
license and service agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit its exposure to potential product liability claims. However, these provisions may not be effective under the laws of all jurisdictions. In addition,
liability insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all claims if MAPICS contractual limitations on liability are ineffective. A successful product liability claim brought against MAPICS could materially and adversely affect
MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, defending such a suit, regardless of its merits, could require MAPICS to incur substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel.
This could also materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 



The unavailability of skilled personnel or MAPICS inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could
hinder MAPICS ability to compete and grow. 

MAPICS future performance depends upon the
continued service of a number of senior management and key technical personnel. The loss or interruption of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on MAPICS business, financial condition and results of
operations. MAPICS future financial results also will depend upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial and marketing personnel. MAPICS does not currently maintain key-person life insurance on any key
employees. 

Competition for qualified personnel is intense and is likely to intensify in the future. MAPICS
competes for qualified personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources. MAPICS has at times experienced and continues to experience difficulty recruiting and retaining
qualified personnel. MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to hire qualified personnel or if it is unable to retain qualified personnel in the future.

MAPICS depends on the continued market for IBMs eServer iSeries computers for a significant portion
of MAPICS revenue, and MAPICS cannot be sure that this market will grow in the future or that MAPICS can increase MAPICS share of this market. 

MAPICS continues to depend on the market for software products on the IBM eServer iSeries platform. Most of MAPICS revenue for fiscal 2001 was derived from the
licensing of MAPICS software products and related services for this platform. MAPICS will continue to offer enhanced software products for this market, but there is no guarantee that MAPICS existing or prospective customers will buy or
support these products. The eServer iSeries market is not expected to grow, and there can be no assurance that it will grow in the future. MAPICS future growth depends, in part, on MAPICS ability to gain market share. There can be no
assurance that MAPICS can maintain or increase MAPICS relative share of this market. 

MAPICS
depends on the continued market for Oracle software products and Microsoft technology for a portion of its revenue, and any decrease in customer demand for these products and technology would adversely affect its operating results.

MAPICS continues to depend on the market for Oracle software and Microsoft technology. An increasing
amount of its revenue is derived from the licensing of software products and related services that operate on these platforms. MAPICS will continue to offer enhanced software products using these platforms, but there is no guarantee that its
existing or prospective customers will buy or support these products. 

Any decrease in MAPICS
licensing activity is likely to result in reduced services revenue in future periods. 

MAPICS
service, maintenance and support revenue is derived from its installation, implementation, training, consulting, systems integration and software product maintenance and support services. Typically a decrease in MAPICS service, maintenance and
support revenue follows a decrease in its licensed software installations. MAPICS ability to maintain or increase its service, maintenance and support revenue depends in large part on MAPICS ability to increase its software licensing
activity. 

If MAPICS network of independent local companies is unable or unwilling to sell and support
its products, MAPICS revenues will decline. 

MAPICS markets, sells and provides professional
services for its products primarily through a global network of approximately 90 independent local affiliates. MAPICS also maintains a limited direct sales force. MAPICS relies on its affiliates for sales, product implementation, customization and,
outside of North America, certain customer support services that are provided in conjunction with MAPICS. If MAPICS is unable to



maintain effective long-term relationships with its affiliates or if these affiliates fail to meet MAPICS customers needs, MAPICS business, financial condition and results of
operations would be adversely affected. 

From time to time, some of MAPICS competitors have established, and
may continue to seek to establish, a comparable distribution channel, in part by attempting to attract MAPICS affiliates. MAPICS agreements with affiliates are generally of short duration and can be terminated by an affiliate in some
instances. If affiliates reduce or discontinue their relationships with MAPICS or their support of MAPICS products, MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 

The ability of MAPICS affiliates to meet MAPICS customers needs depends upon their ability to attract, develop, motivate
and retain highly skilled professionals and technical personnel. These personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially adversely affected, if the affiliates are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of professional and technical personnel. 

If MAPICS is unable to effectively manage its anticipated growth, its financial condition will be adversely affected. 

Anticipated growth in MAPICS business may strain its management and systems. MAPICS future operating results depend in part on the ability of its officers and
other key employees to manage the integration of acquired businesses, to continue implementing and improving MAPICS operational and financial controls, to expand, train and manage employees effectively and to successfully develop new products
and enhancements to existing products. MAPICS growth also depends on its ability to retain and attract new affiliates, and these affiliates ability to grow, to manage their growth and to implement MAPICS products in response to the
projected demands of its customers. MAPICS cannot assure you that it or its affiliates will be able to successfully market and sell new products or that either MAPICS or its affiliates will be able to successfully manage any future expansion.
MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if MAPICS or its affiliates are unable to effectively manage growth. 

MAPICS is subject to the risk of terrorism, including the resulting possible disruptions in business activities and loss of business. 

MAPICS business can be affected by the disruptions caused by terrorist activities. Terrorist acts can create disruptions in ordinary
business activities, including, but not limited to, communications, business travel and the availability of key personnel and physical assets. Additionally, terrorist acts may cause uncertainty about business continuity and the effectiveness of
disaster recovery plans and the disaster recovery plans of MAPICS value chain partners, and may adversely affect the confidence and behavior of MAPICS customers, employees and trading partners. 

MAPICS international operations subject it to a number of risks that could substantially hinder future growth and current
results. 

A substantial portion of MAPICS business comes from outside the United States. MAPICS
believes that future growth and profitability will require expansion of its sales in international markets. To expand international sales successfully, MAPICS must continue to invest substantial resources in 



establishing new foreign operations; 



improving existing or establishing new affiliate relationships; and 



hiring additional personnel, each of which may result in substantial expenses. 

International expansion of operations also will require MAPICS to continue to localize applications and translate them into foreign languages, which can be a difficult and costly process. If
MAPICS cannot expand its international operations or localize and translate its applications in a timely and accurate manner, MAPICS operating results could be adversely affected. Even if MAPICS successfully expands its international
operations, MAPICS cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain or increase its international market presence or demand for products. 



Risks inherent in MAPICS international business activities include, among
others: 



the imposition of government controls; 



restrictions on the export of critical technology; 



political and economic instability, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and devaluation of foreign currencies; 



trade restrictions; 



difficulties in staffing international offices; 



difficulty in collecting fees or the inability to do so; 



longer accounts receivable payment collection cycles in some countries; 



burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; 



management of an organization spread over various countries; 



unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 



overlap of different tax structures; 



the lack of effective copyright, trademark and trade secret protection in some countries where MAPICS sell its products; and 



delays in localizing our products for new markets. 

Any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

As a result of the continued expansion of MAPICS international operations, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies in which MAPICS conducts its business may
cause MAPICS to experience currency transaction gains and losses. Because of the number of foreign currencies involved, MAPICS constantly changing currency exposure and the volatility of currency exchange rates, MAPICS cannot predict the
effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results. These currency risks could materially and adversely affect MAPICS business, financial condition and results of operations. 

MAPICS has adopted measures that have anti-takeover effects and could limit the price of MAPICS stock. 

Georgia law and MAPICS articles of incorporation, bylaws and shareholder rights plan contain provisions that may



make it more difficult for a third party to acquire MAPICS; 



discourage acquisition bids for MAPICS; 



discourage changes in MAPICS management; and 



limit the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of MAPICS common stock. The most significant of these provisions are described below.

Provisions of Georgia law have anti-takeover effects. 

Georgia law prohibits MAPICS from entering into some business combination transactions with any person for a period of five years from the
date the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless specific requirements are satisfied. Generally, an interested shareholder is any person that owns at least 10% of



MAPICS outstanding voting stock, other than MAPICS and its subsidiaries. Georgia law also requires that each of these transactions: 



meets specific fair price criteria and other tests; or 



meets specific requirements relating to approval of the transaction by the MAPICS board of directors and shareholders. 

MAPICS has issued preferred stock and may issue additional preferred stock in the future. 

MAPICS has issued shares of preferred stock in the past and may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future without further
shareholder approval. Any future issuance of preferred stock will have the terms, conditions, rights, privileges and preferences that the board of directors determines. The rights of holders of MAPICS common stock are subject to, and may be
adversely affected by, the rights of holders of MAPICS preferred stock. 

MAPICS articles of
incorporation and bylaws contain additional provisions that have anti-takeover effects. 

The MAPICS board of
directors is divided into three classes. Each class serves for a staggered three-year term. In addition, a director may only be removed from the board for cause and upon the vote of at least 80% of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the
election of the director. This classification of the board of directors and limitation on the removal of directors could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of the MAPICS board of directors. MAPICS articles of
incorporation and bylaws contain additional provisions that have anti-takeover effects. 

MAPICS has adopted a
shareholder rights plan. 

MAPICS has adopted a shareholder rights plan under which MAPICS has distributed to
its shareholders rights to purchase shares of Series F junior participating preferred stock. If specific triggering events occur, the holders of the rights will be able to purchase shares of MAPICS common stock at a price substantially
discounted from the then applicable market price. The shareholder rights plan could increase a potential acquirers costs of effecting a merger with MAPICS or a tender offer for MAPICS outstanding securities that is not approved by the
MAPICS board of directors. These increased costs could prevent or discourage such a transaction, even though MAPICS shareholders might want to vote in favor of the merger or participate in the tender offer. 

MAPICS common stock price could drop because shares of its outstanding stock are eligible for future sale and some holders of
its securities have registration rights. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of MAPICS common
stock, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of MAPICS common stock. These sales or the prospect of these sales also could impair MAPICS ability to raise needed funds in the capital markets at a
favorable time and price. As of December 3, 2002, MAPICS had a total of 18,393,171 shares of common stock outstanding, most of which are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The remaining outstanding
shares will be eligible for sale in the public market at various times pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 

As of December 3, 2002, MAPICS had options outstanding under stock option plans for the purchase of a total of 
5,215,408 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.19 per share. MAPICS has reserved an
additional 932,583 shares of common stock that MAPICS may issue upon the exercise of options granted in the future under MAPICS plans. MAPICS also reserved 301,765 shares of common stock that it may issue under its employee stock purchase
plan. MAPICS has in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering its issuance of shares upon the exercise of these outstanding options and its issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan. All of these shares will
be freely tradable in the public market, except for



shares held by MAPICS directors, officers and principal shareholders, which will be eligible for public sale at various times pursuant to Rule 144. 

Entities affiliated with General Atlantic Partners, LLC have demand and piggyback registration rights for:



1,000,000 shares of common stock that are issuable upon the exercise of warrants that are exercisable at a price of $11.53 per share; 



1,499,990 shares of common stock that are issuable upon the conversion of MAPICS convertible preferred stock; and 



1,500,010 shares of outstanding common stock. 

The demand registration rights permit the holders of these securities to require MAPICS to register the sale of this common stock under the Securities Act. The piggyback registration rights permit the
holders of these securities to participate in any registration of MAPICS common stock under the Securities Act. Another of MAPICS shareholders also has piggyback registration rights for 250,000 shares of common stock that MAPICS will issue
upon the conversion of convertible preferred stock. If these holders require MAPICS to include their shares in a registration that MAPICS initiates, it could adversely affect MAPICS ability to raise needed capital in the public market at a
favorable time and price. 

The 1,749,990 shares of common stock underlying MAPICS convertible preferred
stock and the 1,500,010 shares of common stock held directly by entities affiliated with General Atlantic Partners currently are eligible for sale in the public market subject to the conditions of Rule 144. In addition, the 1,000,000 shares of
common stock underlying the warrants held by entities affiliated with General Atlantic Partners will be eligible for sale in the public market at any future time or times permitted by Rule 144. 

MAPICS cannot predict every event and circumstance that may impact its business and, therefore, the risks and uncertainties discussed above may not be the only
ones you should consider. 

The risks and uncertainties discussed above are in addition to those that apply
to most businesses generally. In addition, as MAPICS continues to grow its business, MAPICS may encounter other risks of which it is not aware at this time. These additional risks may cause serious damage to MAPICS business in the future, the
impact of which MAPICS cannot estimate at this time.

and its operations, see Factors That May Affect Future Results And Market Price of Stock in Frontsteps Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, which is attached as Annex G to this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

Purpose of the Shareholder Meetings 

MAPICS
.    At the
MAPICS annual meeting, MAPICS shareholders will consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of MAPICS will merge with and into Frontstep, with MAPICS
as the sole shareholder of Frontstep following the merger. Collectively, the Frontstep shareholders will receive in the merger 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock, or approximately 19% of the outstanding MAPICS common stock immediately following
the merger. At the MAPICS annual meeting, MAPICS shareholders also will be voting to approve the election of two Class III directors to each serve three year terms until the 2006 annual meeting and to approve, among other things, an increase in the
number of shares of MAPICS common stock available under the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. MAPICS shareholders also may consider and transact any other business properly presented at the MAPICS annual meeting, including, if submitted to a
vote of MAPICS shareholders, a motion to adjourn the annual meeting to another time or place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. 

Frontstep
.    The Frontstep special meeting is being held for Frontstep shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the merger and the adoption of the merger
agreement. At the Frontstep special meeting, Frontstep shareholders also may consider and transact any other business properly presented at the Frontstep special meeting, including, if submitted to a vote of Frontstep shareholders, a motion to
adjourn the special meeting to another time or place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. 

Shareholder Record Date for the Shareholder Meetings 

MAPICS
.    The MAPICS board of directors has fixed the close of business on January 14, 2003, as the record date for determination of MAPICS shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual
meeting. On the record date, there were 20,195,997 shares (on an as converted basis) of MAPICS common stock outstanding, held by approximately 476 holders of record. This assumes conversion of all 125,000 outstanding shares of MAPICS Series D
convertible preferred stock and 49,999 outstanding shares of MAPICS Series E convertible preferred stock at the current conversion ratio of 10 shares of MAPICS common stock for each share of MAPICS convertible preferred stock. 



Frontstep
.    The Frontstep board of directors has
fixed the close of business on January 14, 2003, as the record date for determination of Frontstep shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were 13,960,615 outstanding Frontstep common
shares, held by approximately 219 holders of record. 

Vote Required 

MAPICS.
 The securities that can be voted at the MAPICS annual
meeting consist of: 



common stock, $.01 par value per share; 



Series D convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share; and 



Series E convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share. 

Holders of MAPICS common stock are entitled to cast one vote for each share held on the record date on each matter submitted to the shareholders at the annual meeting. Holders of MAPICS Series D
convertible preferred stock and Series E convertible preferred stock are entitled to vote on an as converted basis with the holders of the common stock as a single class. Holders of MAPICS Series D and Series E convertible preferred stock are
entitled to cast 10 votes for each share of Series D or Series E convertible preferred stock held on the record date on each matter submitted to the shareholders at the annual meeting. 

The presence at the MAPICS annual meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast will constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at the annual meeting. In determining whether a quorum is present, MAPICS will apply the following principles: 



Votes withheld from any director nominee, as well as abstentions with regard to any other proposal that may properly come before the meeting, will be considered
to be votes entitled to be cast and will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. 



Broker non-votes will not be considered to be votes entitled to be cast but will be counted as present for quorum purposes. Broker non-votes are
votes that brokerage firms and banks holding shares of record for their customers are not permitted to cast under stock exchange rules because the brokerage firms and banks have not received specific instructions from their customers as to certain
proposals and as to which the brokerage firms and banks have advised MAPICS that they lack voting authority. 

With respect to the second proposal regarding election of directors, MAPICS articles of incorporation provide that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes, which means that the two nominees who receive the largest
number of votes will be elected as directors. Therefore, a vote to withhold authority for the election of any nominee will not be counted in determining the number of votes cast for that nominee and will not affect the outcome. Each of
the other two proposals must be approved by a majority of the votes represented at the annual meeting and entitled to be cast on the proposal. Abstentions will be counted in determining the number of votes cast on these two proposals and therefore
will have the same effect as votes against the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger and against the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

MAPICS believes that under applicable stock exchange rules, brokerage firms and banks will be able to vote their customers unvoted shares with regard to the proposal
to elect two Class III directors, but will not be able to do so with regard to the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger and with regard to the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. With regard to these two
proposals, broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum but will not be considered as votes entitled to be cast on either of the two proposals. Therefore, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on these
two proposals. 

As of the record date, MAPICS directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned
approximately 1.2% of the outstanding shares of MAPICS stock (on an as converted basis) entitled to vote at the annual meeting. 



Frontstep.
    The holders of a majority of the
outstanding Frontstep common shares must be represented either in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Frontstep special meeting. Holders of Frontstep common shares are entitled to cast one vote for each
common share held on the record date on each matter submitted to the shareholders at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares is required to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger. As of the Frontstep record date, Frontstep directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned approximately 60.90% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares, and holders of approximately 60.90% of the outstanding
Frontstep common shares have agreed to vote for adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Because adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Frontstep shareholders requires the affirmative vote of holders of a specified percentage of outstanding Frontstep common shares, abstaining, not returning a
proxy card or failing to instruct your broker on how to vote Frontstep common shares held by the broker for you will have the same effect as voting against adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Approval of an adjournment proposal at the Frontstep special meeting requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding Frontstep common shares represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting. 

Broker non-votes
will be included for determining whether there is a quorum at the special meeting. Broker non-votes are votes that brokerage firms and banks holding shares of record for their customers are not permitted to cast under stock exchange rules because
the brokerage firms and banks have not received specific instructions from their customers as to certain proposals and as to which the brokerage firms and banks have advised Frontstep that they lack voting authority. Frontstep believes that under
applicable stock exchange rules, brokerage firms and banks will not be able to vote their customers unvoted Frontstep common shares on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. Because the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares is required to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger. 

Proxies 

All shares of MAPICS common, Series D convertible preferred and Series E
convertible preferred stock and all Frontstep common shares represented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the applicable shareholder meetings will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated on those proxy cards. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted FOR approval of the proposals to be considered at the applicable shareholder meeting and to approve those other matters that
properly come before the shareholder meeting or that may be incident to the conduct of the shareholder meeting at the discretion of the persons named in the proxy card. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your
shares. 

Either shareholder meeting may be adjourned or postponed in order to permit further solicitation of
proxies. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger or against the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger will be voted on any proposal to adjourn or postpone the shareholder meeting.
MAPICS does not expect that any matters other than approval of the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, the election of two Class III directors and the amendment to the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan will be brought before
its annual meeting. Frontstep does not expect that any matters other than adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be brought before its special meeting. If, however, other matters incident to the conduct of the MAPICS or
Frontstep meetings are considered, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld on the proxy card. 

A shareholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted by: 



notifying in writing the secretary of MAPICS, Inc. at 1000 Windward Concourse Parkway, Suite 100, Alpharetta, Georgia 30005, if you are a MAPICS shareholder, or
the secretary of Frontstep, Inc. at 2800 Corporate Exchange Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43231, if you are a Frontstep shareholder; 





granting a subsequently dated proxy; or 



appearing in person and voting at the shareholder meeting if you are a holder of record. 

Attendance at a shareholder meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy. 

Solicitation of Proxies 

MAPICS and Frontstep will equally share the expenses incurred
in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. MAPICS and Frontstep each have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. for a fee of $7,500 and $1,500, respectively, plus expenses, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. MAPICS, Frontstep and Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. will request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of MAPICS common stock or Frontstep common shares beneficially owned by others to send this
joint proxy statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other
electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of MAPICS and Frontstep. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation. 



PROPOSAL 1:    THE MERGER 

The following information describes
material aspects of the merger. This description does not provide a complete description of all the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. It is qualified in its entirety by the text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The merger agreement is incorporated herein by reference. You are urged to read all of the Annexes in their entirety. 

General 

The merger agreement provides for the acquisition of Frontstep by MAPICS
pursuant to the merger of FP Acquisition Sub, Inc., a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of MAPICS created for the purpose of the merger, with and into Frontstep, with Frontstep as the surviving corporation in the merger. Following the merger,
the combined company will be managed by the directors and executive officers of MAPICS. 

What Frontstep Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger 

When we complete the merger,
each outstanding Frontstep common share (other than shares held by Frontstep or its subsidiaries and shares held by Frontstep shareholders who perfect their statutory dissenters rights) will be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive approximately .300846 of a share of MAPICS common stock, together with associated rights under MAPICS amended and restated rights plan, as amended. This exchange ratio is determined by dividing the aggregate 4,200,000
shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger by the total number of Frontstep common shares outstanding at the time the merger is completed. Collectively, Frontstep shareholders will hold approximately 
19%
 of the
outstanding MAPICS common stock immediately following the merger (without giving effect to any Frontstep shareholders who perfect their statutory dissenters rights or any fractional shares that are paid in cash). Frontstep shareholders who
perfect their dissenters rights will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation in the merger the value of their Frontstep common shares in cash as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code. See
Rights of Dissenting Shareholders. 

MAPICS will not issue any fractional shares of common stock
in the merger. Rather, MAPICS will pay cash for any fractional share any Frontstep shareholder otherwise would have received in the merger. The cash paid in lieu of fractional shares will be in an amount equal to the fraction multiplied by the
closing price of one share of MAPICS common stock on the last trading day preceding the completion of the merger. 

If MAPICS effects a stock split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization with respect to MAPICS common stock and the record date, in the case of a stock dividend, or the effective date, in the case of a stock split or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established, is prior to the completion of the merger, the exchange ratio will be adjusted appropriately. 

Background of the Merger 

Frontstep management has periodically explored and assessed
strategic options for Frontstep as part of its ongoing effort to strengthen Frontsteps business and to enhance shareholder value. During the past several years, Frontstep management periodically considered and discussed the apparent
consolidation trend in the manufacturing management software industry and the possibility of a business combination or other strategic transaction with another software company. From time to time, Frontstep management has met with representatives of
other software companies to discuss opportunities for an acquisition transaction involving Frontstep. 

From August
2001 to December 2001, Stephen A. Sasser, Frontsteps president and chief executive officer, and other members of Frontstep management held discussions with a European software company regarding a possible merger. Frontstep management
periodically reviewed such discussions with the Frontstep board of directors. In September 2001, Frontstep retained Updata Capital, Inc. to represent it as financial advisor in ongoing discussions related to this possible merger. On November 7,
2001, the Frontstep board of directors met



to consider a possible combination of the two companies and authorized Frontstep management to pursue discussions with the European software company. In December 2001, the European software
company and Frontstep signed non-disclosure agreements and began to share financial and business information shortly thereafter. 

Over the course of several board meetings in late 2001, Richard C. Cook, MAPICS president and chief executive officer, presented to the MAPICS board of directors a strategic plan to grow MAPICS through accretive acquisitions.
Mr. Cooks focus was on building a larger customer base and acquiring complementary solutions. The MAPICS board of directors agreed with managements strategic plan and authorized Mr. Cook to explore acquisition opportunities. Throughout
the remainder of 2001 and into 2002, Mr. Cook and MAPICS management explored several possible acquisition alternatives and presented them periodically for review to the MAPICS board of directors. 

In January 2002, Frontstep and the European software company exchanged various drafts of preliminary non-binding term sheets and discussed possible structures for
completing a merger. 

In February 2002, as a result of the discussions being held, the Frontstep board of
directors created a special corporate development committee for the purpose of reviewing the ongoing merger discussions with the European software company and considering other strategic alternatives. The corporate development committee is comprised
of four non-employee directors, none of whom has ever held more than 5% of Frontsteps common shares or Series A convertible preferred shares, or represented any principal holders of such shares. The Frontstep directors selected for service on
the corporate development committee are Zuheir Sofia, chairman, Roger Blackwell, James Rutherford and Duke Thomas. 

As a result of its consideration of strategic alternatives, the corporate development committee determined that Frontstep should pursue a private auction of the company with a limited number of potential strategic or financial
purchasers. The corporate development committee retained Updata to act as Frontsteps financial advisor in this broader effort to arrange a business combination and in its discussions with other possible merger partners in addition to the
European software company. Also in February 2002, the corporate development committee retained William Blair to render a fairness opinion in connection with any transaction. 

From February to April 2002, Updata and Frontstep developed an information package for distribution to interested parties, researched possible merger partners and began to
contact potentially interested merger partners. The contact with these companies included signing of non-disclosure agreements, distribution of the information packages, limited due diligence and, in some cases, direct meetings between executives of
the companies and Frontstep management. Discussions also continued between the European software company and Frontstep. During this period, the parties continued to exchange drafts of preliminary non-binding term sheets and several meetings between
senior executive officers of both companies and their financial advisors occurred. These discussions centered upon the structure and proposed terms of a potential merger. 

In early February 2002, Mr. Fox and Mr. Sasser separately contacted Mr. Cook to discuss whether MAPICS might be interested in a merger with Frontstep. Mr. Sasser and Mr.
Cook had many informal, preliminary discussions over the past several years about the potential advantages of such a merger. On February 26, 2002, at Frontsteps request, Updata initiated a meeting between Mr. Sasser and representatives of
General Atlantic Partners, LLC, an affiliate of MAPICS, to discuss potential strategic alternatives including a potential merger with MAPICS. 

On March 1, 2002, Frontstep and MAPICS executed a non-disclosure agreement, and on March 4, 2002, Updata sent a package of information regarding Frontstep to Mr. Cook, including a summary of
Frontsteps business and strategic plan and certain Frontstep SEC filings. In April 2002, MAPICS retained SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to act as MAPICS financial advisor in ongoing discussions related to the potential acquisition of
Frontstep and, if necessary, to issue a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger. 



On April 5, 2002, the strategic relations committee of the MAPICS board of directors met and authorized MAPICS management
to review the potential strategic benefits and synergies available under a potential transaction with Frontstep, including those related to Frontsteps soon-to-be-released new core application. Over the next several weeks, MAPICS considered the
information it had received from Updata and held several discussions with Mr. Sasser and representatives of Updata regarding possible merger terms and other strategic matters, including a meeting on April 16, 2002 in Atlanta between Mr. Sasser and
MAPICS management. On April 30, 2002, representatives of the two companies met to discuss Frontsteps products and product plans. 

During a subsequent meeting 
of the strategic relations committee

on May 3, 2002, Mr. Cook presented the results of the management teams review and described Frontsteps bidding process, and the

strategic relations committee
 decided that MAPICS should not participate in that bidding process. Mr. Cook communicated this position to Mr. Sasser in early May 2002. 

In May 2002, at the request of the corporate development committee, Updata requested preliminary non-binding indications of interest from parties to whom Updata had
provided Frontsteps information package. Numerous companies declined to submit preliminary indications of interest, including MAPICS. However, several companies submitted indications of interest, including the European software company.

During the next 60 days, the corporate development committee met on several occasions to review these
submissions and to hold discussions with the interested companies in order to consider the adequacy and fairness of the non-binding indications. During this time, numerous discussions were held between the corporate development committee and Updata,
as well as between Updata and the interested parties, to clarify the terms of the submissions and to attempt to negotiate improvements in their financial terms. 

In June and July 2002, the corporate development committee invited three of the interested parties to conduct initial due diligence, and these companies visited the
corporate offices of Frontstep in Columbus, Ohio to perform such due diligence. Frontstep management also performed initial due diligence with respect to these companies during this period. 

On July 17, 2002, a representative of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey contacted Updata to inform Updata of continued interest by MAPICS in a possible merger with Frontstep.
Updata provided updated Frontstep financial information to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, and Frontstep and MAPICS renewed discussions regarding a possible business combination. 

During August 2002, Frontstep continued its discussions with the European software company regarding an acceptable term sheet for a possible combination of the two
companies. On August 22, 2002, the European software companys chief executive officer and financial advisors met with the Frontstep board of directors to discuss the terms of its proposal and to review the strategic attractiveness of a merger.
On August 27, 2002, the European software company delivered a non-binding term sheet to Frontstep and on September 4, 2002, the European software company revised the non-binding term sheet and included a list of key terms to be included in an
exclusivity agreement with the European software company. Frontstep did not execute an exclusivity agreement with that company. 

On August 21, 2002, representatives of MAPICS and Frontstep, including Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser, met in Columbus, Ohio to continue their due diligence and to discuss the terms of a possible transaction. Mr. Cook met later
that day with members of the corporate development committee to discuss related issues and to answer questions from committee members. Following these meetings, Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser spoke by telephone on August 29, 2002, and Mr. Cook confirmed
MAPICS interest in a transaction with Frontstep and provided Mr. Sasser with some of the preliminary terms that were being considered by MAPICS management. On September 9 and 10, 2002, representatives of MAPICS visited with Frontstep
management in Columbus for further discussions and to complete initial due diligence. Following these meetings, the financial advisors of each



company, and members of each companys board of directors, including Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser, met. During this meeting, the possible terms of a potential transaction, including the number of
MAPICS shares proposed to be issued in exchange for Frontstep shares in the merger and certain conditions relating to the completion of the transaction were reviewed and discussed. 

On September 11, 2002, the MAPICS board of directors met with representatives of MAPICS management and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to discuss the acquisition of Frontstep,
including the rationale for the transaction, the financial model for the combined entities and the recommended terms to be proposed. Following this meeting, MAPICS delivered a preliminary non-binding term sheet and draft of an exclusivity agreement
to Frontstep. 

The preliminary non-binding September 11, 2002 term sheet contemplated that MAPICS would
acquire Frontstep in a stock for stock merger intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. The aggregate purchase price proposed would be paid through the issuance of 4,800,000 shares of MAPICS common stock for
all of the outstanding equity of Frontstep and the assumption of a maximum of $20.0 million of Frontsteps outstanding debt. The offer assumed that all classes of Frontstep equity would be converted to common shares and that all outstanding
Frontstep warrants and options would be exercised or cancelled prior to the merger. In addition, the offer required an adjustment to the purchase price in the event that Frontsteps: 1) working capital was below $22.0 million at closing; 2)
shareholders equity was below $19.0 million at closing; 3) net capitalized software exceeded $16.5 million at closing; or 4) liabilities increased as a result of payment obligations that were triggered by change in control
provisions contained in written employment agreements with Frontstep management (other than certain agreements disclosed to MAPICS between Frontstep and Mr. Sasser and certain other Frontstep executive officers). The term sheet proposed a
termination fee of $2.0 million to be paid by Frontstep under specified conditions and contained additional conditions to closing, including but not limited to, a requirement that Frontsteps debt not exceed $20.0 million at closing.

On September 10 and 11, 2002, the Frontstep corporate development committee met to discuss the two
preliminary term sheets received from the European software company and MAPICS, respectively. At the meeting, representatives of Updata provided an analysis of the comparative differences in valuation and significant terms for the committee. The
corporate development committee agreed unanimously to pursue the completion of a definitive agreement with the European software company, based primarily on a higher valuation and less restrictive closing conditions. On September 11, 2002, the
Frontstep board of directors met to discuss the proposed transaction with the European software company and, after a lengthy discussion, voted unanimously to allow management to proceed to completion of a definitive agreement with the European
software company on terms consistent with its term sheet. This position was communicated to MAPICS. 

During the
remainder of September 2002, Frontstep management was actively engaged with the management of the European software company in finalizing each companys due diligence and in the development of initial transition planning. On September 19, 2002,
the parties agreed to a timetable for the completion of a definitive agreement. 

On September 25, 2002, a
memorandum prepared by Frontsteps outside legal counsel regarding the fiduciary obligations of Frontstep directors in the context of the proposed transaction with the European software company or similar acquisition transactions was
distributed to all members of the Frontstep board of directors. 

During the first week of October 2002, the
European software company asked for a delay of two weeks or more in the timetable because its stock price had declined significantly during this time and there were internal issues preventing it from continuing with the proposed transaction. A draft
of a definitive agreement with the European software company was not distributed between the parties. 



On October 7, 2002, Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser spoke again about the terms of a
possible transaction between Frontstep and MAPICS. On October 8, 2002, MAPICS submitted a revised preliminary term sheet to Frontstep for consideration. Under the revised terms, Frontsteps failure to meet certain debt levels or shareholder
equity levels would give rise to a material adverse change which would allow MAPICS to elect not to proceed with the merger. No adjustment in the consideration was proposed. 

On October 7 and 8, 2002, additional discussion took place between representatives of Updata and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, as well as between Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser and
the Frontstep corporate development committee, regarding the MAPICS revised preliminary term sheet. The corporate development committee expressed a number of concerns with MAPICS revised term sheet. Mr. Sasser subsequently communicated these
and other concerns to Mr. Cook. On October 9, 2002, MAPICS responded with a further revised term sheet. As part of the revisions, MAPICS agreed to consider a mechanism for adjusting the purchase price if Frontstep failed to meet certain financial
conditions, in lieu of a material adverse change provision in the merger agreement. MAPICS also offered to assume the existing Frontstep employee options and the warrant held by Foothill Capital Corporation, subject to an adjustment in the number of
shares issuable under and the exercise price of such securities based on the exchange ratio for the transaction. 

On October 9, 2002, the corporate development committee met to discuss the status of Frontsteps negotiations with the European software company and the revised October 9, 2002 term sheet from MAPICS. Mr. Sasser reported to the
corporate development committee his discussions with management of the European software company regarding their inability to proceed with the negotiations and a proposed transaction. Based on the delays requested by the European software company
and the improved terms offered by MAPICS, the corporate development committee voted in favor of, with one vote against, discontinuing efforts with the European software company and pursuing completion of a transaction with MAPICS. 

On October 14, 2002, MAPICS modified the term sheet again. This term sheet reflected the following principle changes from the
preliminary September 11 term sheet: 1) the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued was modified to be a range from 4,400,000 to 4,800,000 shares, subject to a formula based on the amount of Frontsteps outstanding debt and
shareholders equity at December 31, 2002 (under this formula, if debt was not greater than $20.0 million and shareholders equity was at least $17.0 million, 4,800,000 shares would be issued); 2) the conditions to closing were modified to
eliminate the previous working capital and capitalized software conditions; 3) the conditions to closing were modified to require Frontstep to have no more than $22.0 million in debt and at least $15.0 million in shareholders equity at
December 31, 2002; 4) to allow the Frontstep warrant held by Foothill to be exchanged for a warrant to acquire MAPICS common stock and to allow options held by Frontstep employees to be exchanged for options to acquire MAPICS common stock; and
5) the termination fee was reduced to $1.5 million. The corporate development committee met later that day and voted in favor of, with one vote against, formally recommending that the full Frontstep board of directors approve the MAPICS revised
term sheet in concept, direct management to execute an exclusivity agreement with MAPICS and proceed to complete a definitive agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the term sheet reviewed by the corporate development
committee. 

The Frontstep board of directors met on October 15, 2002 and discussed the MAPICS proposal, the
current relative stock prices of the two companies and their concern about the fact that the proposed consideration would result, as of that date, in a discount to the current market price of the Frontstep common shares. The Frontstep board of
directors also discussed a recent proposal from the holders of Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares. Under the terms of the proposal, the liquidation preference for the Series A convertible preferred shares of $13.6 million would be
reduced by 20% and their Series A warrants to purchase Frontstep common shares would be cancelled. These two concessions were offered as an inducement to Frontstep to agree to the terms of the MAPICS proposal by allowing for a smaller discount to
holders of Frontstep common shares. The Frontstep board of directors voted in favor of, with one vote against, the recommendations from the corporate development committee, subject to finalizing the proposed concessions with the holders of Frontstep
Series A convertible preferred shares. 

After the Frontstep board of directors meeting and various discussions
involving Mr. Cook, Mr. Sasser, the corporate development committee and each of the financial advisors, MAPICS and Frontstep modified the term sheet on October 15, 2002 to refine the formula by which the shares to be issued would be adjusted.



Following this revision, on October 15, 2002, Frontstep and MAPICS executed an
exclusivity agreement that provided for exclusive efforts to complete a definitive agreement on or before November 7, 2002. Each of the companies commenced efforts by their management teams to complete mutual due diligence reviews and to draft the
definitive agreement and related documents. The due diligence reviews, document preparation and continued negotiations regarding the specific terms of the transaction continued from October 15, 2002 to the end of October 2002. 

On October 21, 2002, the European software companys advisors informed Updata that the European software companys
board of directors had rejected the proposed acquisition of Frontstep and that all discussions with Frontstep would be postponed indefinitely. 

At the end of October 2002, Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser held several telephonic discussions regarding the results of each partys due diligence reviews and issues that arose from initial negotiations
regarding a definitive agreement. Mr. Cook advised Mr. Sasser that, as a result of its due diligence investigation, MAPICS proposed to significantly reduce the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger and to modify certain
closing conditions. Mr. Cook expressed concern regarding Frontsteps actual financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 and anticipated results for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, as well as other unexpected costs
associated with completion of the transaction. On November 1, 2002, the corporate development committee met and rejected the revised proposal presented to Mr. Sasser by Mr. Cook. Following this meeting, the Frontstep board of directors met and
approved the decision of the corporate development committee, with two votes against. Mr. Sasser notified Mr. Cook of this decision and all discussions and efforts by the parties were temporarily suspended. 

After numerous discussions between Updata and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey which occurred on November 2 and 3, 2002, MAPICS issued a further
revised non-binding term sheet that reflected changes to several of the terms. Discussions immediately followed between the financial advisors and between Mr. Cook and Mr. Sasser in an effort to reach a new agreement on proposed terms. On November
4, 2002, an agreement in principle was reached, which included the following additional changes: 1) the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued was revised to be 4,400,000 shares in the event that debt did not exceed a prescribed level
or 4,200,000 if debt did exceed such level; and 2) removing the minimum level of shareholders equity as a closing condition. The parties also agreed to complete a definitive agreement with respect to the transaction and announce the execution of
this definitive agreement prior to November 11, 2002, the commencement date of Frontsteps annual user conference. 

On November 4, 2002, Frontsteps corporate development committee met again and considered the revised MAPICS proposal. In addition, based on the relative stock prices of Frontstep and MAPICS at that date (which subsequently
changed), the holders of the Series A convertible preferred shares proposed to accept a greater percentage discount on their liquidation preference if the debt condition was not satisfied. The corporate development committee discussed each of these
revised proposals and voted in favor of, with one vote against, formally recommending that the Frontstep board of directors direct management to continue to negotiate a definitive agreement with MAPICS on terms substantially the same as the MAPICS
revised term sheet of November 4, 2002, and subject to finalization of the revised agreement with the holders of the Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares. The Frontstep board of directors met on November 5, 2002 and voted in favor of,
with two votes against, the recommendation from the corporate development committee. 

On November 7, 2002,
Frontstep and MAPICS extended the exclusivity agreement between the parties to November 13, 2002 to allow the parties time to complete a definitive agreement. 

On November 8, 2002, the MAPICS board of directors held a special telephonic meeting to discuss the current status of negotiations. After reviewing a number of outstanding issues regarding the
potential transaction, the MAPICS board of directors reaffirmed its requirement that all significant shareholders and executive officers



of Frontstep execute a shareholder agreement. MAPICS communicated that requirement to Frontstep that day. The Frontstep board of directors held a telephonic meeting to discuss this requirement.
During discussion of the shareholder agreement, Mr. Fox, a significant common shareholder, founder and chairman of the board of Frontstep, proposed that, in light of his experience in the industry, he be given a board seat and that he be retained as
a consultant to the combined company. On November 9 and 10, 2002, Mr. Cook and Mr. Fox negotiated the terms of Mr. Foxs consulting agreement with MAPICS and it was further agreed that Mr. Fox would not receive a seat on the MAPICS board of
directors. 

On November 9, 2002, all of the draft transaction documents were sent to the MAPICS board of
directors for their review. A special telephonic meeting of the MAPICS board of directors was held on November 12, 2002 to review the terms of the transaction and identify the related outstanding issues. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also presented a
preliminary financial review of the proposed transaction at that meeting. 

Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P., three
entities affiliated with Morgan Stanley, Mr. Fox and James Rutherford hold 10% unsecured subordinated notes due 2004 issued by Frontstep and convertible into Frontstep common shares. In connection with the transaction, MAPICS proposed that the
noteholders, other than Mr. Fox, agree to exchange their existing notes for new unsecured subordinated notes of Frontstep that would not be convertible and that Mr. Foxs notes would be repaid upon completion of the merger. On November 11,
2002, drafts of the form of new notes were delivered to legal counsel for Morgan Stanley for review. Following the review, the noteholders requested that MAPICS guarantee the new notes and, on November 14, 2002, a form of guarantee was provided to
MAPICS for its review. During the following week, negotiations with respect to the form of the new notes and the MAPICS guarantee continued until the parties reached an agreement in principle on November 24, 2002. 

From November 11, 2002 to November 24, 2002, representatives of MAPICS and Frontstep negotiated the remaining issues relating to the
merger agreement, the shareholder agreements and the related documents during a series of conference calls. These issues concerned, among other things, the conditions to the closing of the merger, the specific terms of the shareholder agreements,
the consideration to be paid and the related transaction costs to be incurred by MAPICS, indemnification insurance for current Frontstep directors and officers, and other insurance matters. As a result of these negotiations, the parties agreed to
the following: 1) the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued was revised to be 4,200,000 shares, without any adjustments; 2) MAPICS agreed to the removal of certain conditions to closing, including a financing condition; 3) a
limitation on transaction costs related to the merger to be incurred by Frontstep to $1.5 million; and 4) MAPICS would not be obligated to close if the holders of more than 5% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares exercised their
dissenters rights. 

During the week of November 18, 2002, all of the final transaction documents, including
the merger agreement and shareholder agreements, were distributed to the MAPICS board of directors and the Frontstep board of directors for their review. 

On November 24, 2002, the Frontstep board of directors and its corporate development committee held a concurrent special telephonic meeting to consider the merger and the merger agreement. During the
meeting, representatives of William Blair reviewed the methodologies that it used to analyze the fairness of the exchange ratio in the merger and rendered an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
November 24, 2002, that, as of that date and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio contemplated by the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding
Frontstep common shares. After the presentation by representatives of William Blair, representatives of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP, outside legal counsel to Frontstep, summarized for the Frontstep board of directors the material terms of,
and the resolution of key issues in, the merger agreement, the shareholder agreement, the related agreement with holders of Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares and the affiliate agreement and reviewed the directors fiduciary
duties. 



After the presentations, the Frontstep board meeting was temporarily adjourned, and the corporate development committee
continued its meeting to review and evaluate the merger. After deliberation concerning the terms of the merger and the merger agreement, the corporate development committee found the terms and conditions of the merger and the merger agreement to be
fair to, and in the best interests of, Frontstep and its shareholders, declared the merger advisable and voted unanimously to recommend that the Frontstep board of directors adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and the other
transactions contemplated in the merger agreement. Thereafter, the Frontstep board of directors meeting was reconvened, and the corporate development committee delivered its recommendation to the entire board. After further discussion, the Frontstep
board of directors unanimously approved the merger, the merger agreement, the shareholder agreement, the related agreement with holders of Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares and the transactions contemplated thereby, determined the
terms and conditions of the merger and the merger agreement to be fair to, and in the best interests of, Frontstep and its shareholders and declared it advisable to recommend that Frontstep shareholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger at the Frontstep special meeting. 

Following the Frontstep board meeting, each of the Frontstep
non-employee directors holding options issued pursuant to the Frontstep, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors executed agreements cancelling those options. 

On November 24, 2002, a special telephonic meeting of the MAPICS board of directors also was held to review and discuss the principal terms of the merger. At this meeting,
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey delivered to the MAPICS board of directors its oral opinion, later confirmed in writing, to the effect that the merger consideration to be paid by MAPICS was fair, from a financial point of view, to MAPICS. After further
discussion and deliberation, the MAPICS board of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger and the related transactions and agreements and authorized the management of MAPICS to finalize and execute the merger agreement and related documents
on behalf of MAPICS. 

After the MAPICS and Frontstep telephonic board meetings, MAPICS and Frontstep executed the
merger agreement and the related agreements on the evening of November 24, 2002. The transaction was publicly announced prior to the commencement of trading on November 25, 2002. 

Recommendation of the MAPICS Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger 

The MAPICS
board of directors voted unanimously to approve and adopt the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of MAPICS and its shareholders. 
ACCORDINGLY, THE MAPICS BOARD OF
DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT MAPICS SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF MAPICS COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER.

In reaching its decision to recommend the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, the MAPICS board of directors concluded that combining Frontsteps business, customer base and Microsoft.NET platform
products with MAPICS existing business customer base and products provides a unique opportunity to help MAPICS achieve its strategic goal of becoming one of the worlds leading providers of extended enterprise solutions for discrete and
batch process manufacturing enterprises. In addition, the MAPICS board of directors concluded that the combined entity would have the opportunity for improved financial performance through the realization of synergies as a combined operation. The
MAPICS board of directors believes that the merger accordingly provides an opportunity for achieving enhanced financial performance and increasing shareholder value. 

In concluding that the merger of MAPICS and Frontstep is in the best interests of MAPICS and its shareholders, the MAPICS board of directors consulted with senior members
of MAPICS management regarding the strategic and operational aspects of the merger and the satisfactory results of due diligence efforts undertaken by management. The MAPICS board of directors consulted with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey about the
fairness to MAPICS, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid. The MAPICS board of directors also consulted with Alston & Bird LLP, legal counsel to MAPICS, regarding the duties of the members of the MAPICS board of
directors, legal due diligence matters and the terms of the merger agreement



and related agreements. The MAPICS board of directors reviewed and considered the findings of the transaction services group of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, regarding the results of its
financial and accounting due diligence. 

In concluding that the merger and the issuance of shares of MAPICS common
stock is in the best interests of MAPICS and fair to MAPICS and its shareholders, the MAPICS board of directors considered, among other things, the following factors that supported its decision to approve the merger and recommend that MAPICS
shareholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger: 



the opportunity to expand new customer relationships with offerings on IBM and Microsoft.NET platforms; 



the opportunity to further develop MAPICS and Frontsteps various brands and increase revenues by distributing MAPICS products to
Frontsteps customers and Frontsteps products to MAPICS customers; 



the potential to reduce combined operating expenses and to achieve higher operating margins by leveraging fixed costs over a larger revenue base; 



reports from MAPICS management, financial and accounting and legal professionals regarding the satisfactory results of their due diligence investigation of
Frontstep; 



the terms of the merger agreement and the structure of the merger, including the conditions of each companys obligation to complete the merger;



the merger agreements prohibition against Frontstep soliciting another acquisition, and the agreement by Frontstep to pay MAPICS a termination fee of $1.5
million plus the amount of MAPICS reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the merger under circumstances in which: (1) Frontstep enters into an acquisition agreement or closes an acquisition with another party within twelve
months of the termination of the merger agreement; (2) Frontstep shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; or (3) the Frontstep board of directors changes, withdraws or fails to reaffirm its recommendation that the
Frontstep shareholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; 



the ability of MAPICS and Frontstep to complete the merger; and 



the opinion of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey delivered to the MAPICS board of directors, as of November 24, 2002, and based upon certain assumptions, factors and
limitations, that the merger consideration to be paid by MAPICS in the merger is fair from a financial point of view. 

The MAPICS board of directors also considered the potential adverse consequences of other factors, including: 



the increased level of indebtedness that MAPICS would have to incur in order to repay Frontsteps existing indebtedness and to operate the combined
business; 



the risk that the merger would not be completed; 



the effect of the public announcement of the merger on the customer relations and operating results of both MAPICS and Frontstep, on the ability of each company
to retain employees and maintain revenue and on the trading price of MAPICS common stock; 



the substantial management time and effort that will be required to consummate the merger and integrate the operations of the two companies; 



the difficulty inherent in integrating businesses and the risk that the cost efficiencies, synergies and other benefits expected to be obtained in the
transaction might not be fully realized; 



the risks identified in the due diligence reports provided by financial and accounting and legal professionals; and 



other risks described in this joint proxy statement-prospectus under Risk Factors. 

In the judgment of the MAPICS board of directors, the potential benefits of the merger substantially outweighed the risks inherent in the merger.



The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the MAPICS board of directors
is not exhaustive, but MAPICS believes it includes the material factors considered by the MAPICS board of directors. The MAPICS board of directors did not quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors the MAPICS
board of directors considered in reaching its determination to recommend the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger. Rather, the MAPICS board viewed its position and recommendation as being based on the total information presented
to and considered by the MAPICS board of directors. In addition, individual directors may have assigned different weights to different factors. 

Recommendation of the Frontstep Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger 

The
Frontstep board of directors and its corporate development committee believe that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Frontstep and its shareholders. The members of the Frontstep
corporate development committee unanimously recommended that the Frontstep board of directors adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The members of the Frontstep board of directors have unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. 
ACCORDINGLY, THE FRONTSTEP BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT FRONTSTEP SHAREHOLDERS ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVE THE MERGER.

In reaching the decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the Frontstep corporate development committee and the
Frontstep board of directors consulted with Frontstep management, the provider of the fairness opinion reviewed by the Frontstep board of directors, William Blair & Co., L.L.C., its financial advisor, Updata Capital, Inc. and Frontsteps
outside legal counsel, Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP, and carefully considered numerous factors, including, without limitation, those discussed below that support their recommendations. 

Frontstep Corporate Development Committee. 

In reaching its determination, the Frontstep corporate development committee considered the following factors, among others, that support its recommendation: 



the opinion of William Blair that, as of November 24, 2002 and based upon and subject to certain assumptions, factors and limitations, the exchange ratio is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding Frontstep common shares; 



the opportunity for Frontstep shareholders to participate, as holders of MAPICS common stock, over the long-term in a larger, more diversified extended
enterprise solutions company with increased financial strength, and the opportunity to benefit from cost savings and other benefits of size and operating efficiencies; 



the fact that because the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger is fixed, Frontstep shareholders will benefit from any increase in
the trading price of MAPICS common stock between the announcement and the closing of the merger; 



the fact that, on the date the Frontstep corporate development committee recommended that the Frontstep board of directors adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger, the implied value of the exchange ratio represented a premium over the closing price per Frontstep common share; 



the terms and conditions of the merger and related agreements, including: 



the amount and form of consideration to be received by Frontstep shareholders; 



the fact that the merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and
is, therefore, not expected to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes to Frontstep shareholders to the extent they receive shares of MAPICS common stock in exchange for Frontstep common shares; 





the shareholder agreements; 



the restrictions relating to solicitation of third party proposals and the boards ability to consider and accept any unsolicited superior acquisition
proposals; and 



the termination provisions in the merger agreement; 



reports from Frontstep management, financial and accounting and legal professionals regarding the satisfactory results of their due diligence investigation of
MAPICS; 



the right of the Frontstep board of directors to withdraw, modify or change its recommendation to Frontstep shareholders that they adopt the merger agreement
and approve the merger, if the Frontstep board of directors believes in good faith, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to cause the Frontstep board of directors to fail to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 



the financial performance, condition and cash flows of Frontstep and MAPICS, on both a historical and prospective basis, and the historical market prices and
trading information with respect to Frontstep common shares and MAPICS common stock; 



the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing contingency on the part of MAPICS; 



the strategic risks and prospects of Frontstep continuing to operate as an independent company, including: 



the fact that, based upon preliminary contacts and informal discussions with a number of other parties, the Frontstep corporate development committee believed
that it was unlikely that another party would make an offer to acquire Frontstep that would be more favorable to Frontstep and its shareholders than the merger; 



the fact that, under the eighth amendment to Frontsteps current credit facility, Foothill had the ability to terminate its commitment to fund Frontstep if
Frontstep failed (1) to deliver a signed transaction agreement by a qualified buyer that would assume the Foothill obligations; or (2) to engage, by a specified date, an investment banking firm acceptable to Foothill to develop a business plan to
sell Frontstep, raise capital or complete a financial restructuring by a specified date; 



the risk that Frontstep would not be able to achieve levels of revenue sufficient to satisfy its cash flow needs or to meet its financial covenants under its
credit facility with Foothill during future periods; and 



the risk that Foothill would not provide special financing arrangements for Frontstep in the future to meet its operating cash needs and that Frontstep may not
be able to obtain other debt or equity financing from other sources; and 



the requirement of the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger. 

The Frontstep corporate development committee also considered a variety of risks and
other possibly negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, without limitation, that: 



as a result of the fixed number of shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger, Frontstep shareholders would be adversely affected by any decrease
in the market price of MAPICS common stock between the announcement and the completion of the merger, and Frontstep is not permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of MAPICS common stock;



the risk that the merger would not be completed; 



the nature and extent of the interests of Frontstep management and certain Frontstep shareholders in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of other Frontstep shareholders in general; 





the effect of the public announcement of the merger on Frontsteps customer relations, operating results and ability to retain employees, and on the
trading price of Frontstep common shares; 



the substantial management time and effort that will be required to consummate the merger and integrate the operations of the two companies; 



the difficulty inherent in integrating businesses and the risk that the cost efficiencies, synergies and other benefits expected to be obtained in the
transaction might not be fully realized; and 



other risks described in this joint proxy statement-prospectus under Risk Factors. 

In the judgment of the Frontstep corporate development committee, the potential benefits of the merger substantially outweighed the risks
inherent in the merger. 

Frontstep Board of Directors. 

In reaching its determination, the Frontstep board of directors considered and relied upon: 



the factors considered by the Frontstep corporate development committee; 



the conclusions reached, recommendation made and unanimous approval of the merger and the merger agreement by the Frontstep corporate development committee; and



William Blairs opinion that, as of November 24, 2002, the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding Frontstep
common shares. 

The foregoing discussion describes the material factors considered by the
Frontstep corporate development committee and the Frontstep board of directors in their consideration of the merger. Because of the variety of factors considered, the Frontstep corporate development committee and the Frontstep board of directors did
not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the specific factors considered in reaching their determination. The determination to approve the merger and the merger agreement
was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In addition, individual members of the Frontstep corporate development committee and the Frontstep board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. 

In considering the recommendation of the Frontstep board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, Frontstep
shareholders should be aware that certain of Frontsteps directors and executive officers have arrangements that cause them to have interests in the transaction that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Frontstep
shareholders generally. See The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger. 

Opinion of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey 

MAPICS has engaged SunTrust Robinson Humphrey as
its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. At a meeting of the MAPICS board of directors on November 24, 2002, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed with the board its financial analysis of the merger and delivered its opinion that,
as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to certain matters stated therein, the consideration to be paid by MAPICS in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to MAPICS. 

The full text of the opinion of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the SunTrust Robinson Humphrey opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey opinion. MAPICS shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. 

SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion is directed to the board of directors of MAPICS and relates only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid in the merger. SunTrust



Robinson Humphreys opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote at the MAPICS
annual meeting. 

Material and Information Considered with Respect to the Merger 

In arriving at its opinion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, among other things: 



reviewed drafts of the merger agreement, including the exhibits, and the other agreements related to the merger; 



reviewed certain publicly available information concerning MAPICS and Frontstep that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey believed to be relevant to its analysis;



reviewed and analyzed certain historical and projected financial and operating data concerning MAPICS and Frontstep furnished to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey by
MAPICS and Frontstep, respectively; 



conducted discussions with members of management of MAPICS and Frontstep concerning their respective businesses, operations, present conditions, future
prospects and expected strategic benefits from the combination of MAPICS and Frontstep; 



reviewed the historical market prices and trading activities for common stock of MAPICS and common shares of Frontstep and compared them with those of selected
publicly-traded companies that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant; 



compared the historical and projected financial results and present financial condition of MAPICS and Frontstep with those of selected publicly-traded companies
that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant; 



reviewed the financial terms of the merger with, to the extent publicly available, financial terms of selected merger and acquisition transactions that SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant; 



reviewed historical data relating to percentage premiums paid in acquisitions of publicly-traded companies; 



performed certain financial analyses with respect to MAPICS and Frontsteps pro forma financial condition and projected future operating performance;
and 



reviewed other financial statistics and undertook other analyses and investigations as SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed appropriate. 

In arriving at its opinion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness
of the financial and other information provided to it by MAPICS and Frontstep without independent verification. With respect to the financial forecasts of MAPICS and Frontstep, including estimates of the cost savings and other potential synergies
anticipated to result from the merger, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey was advised by the senior management of MAPICS and Frontstep that they were reasonably prepared and reflected the best available estimates and judgments of the management of both
MAPICS and Frontstep. In arriving at its opinion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of MAPICS and Frontstep. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has not made or obtained any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of MAPICS or Frontstep. 

The SunTrust Robinson Humphrey opinion is
necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the information made available to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, as of the date of its opinion. The financial markets in general, and the
market for common stock of MAPICS and common shares of Frontstep in particular, are subject to volatility, and SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion did not address potential developments in the financial markets or the market for common stock
of MAPICS or common shares of Frontstep after the date of its opinion. For purposes of its opinion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey assumed that: 



the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and related documents without any waiver of any material terms or
conditions by MAPICS or Frontstep; 





the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes; and 



all material governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained
without requiring any restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, that would have a material adverse effect on MAPICS, Frontstep or the expected benefits of the merger. 

Subsequent developments may affect SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. 

In preparing its opinion, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, a summary of which is provided below. The summary is not a complete description of the analyses underlying SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is
a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to
summary description. Accordingly, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey believes that its analyses must be considered as an integrated whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying such analyses and SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion. 

In performing its analyses, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey made numerous assumptions with respect to MAPICS, Frontstep, industry performance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions, many of which are beyond the
control of MAPICS and Frontstep. The estimates contained in these analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. 

SunTrust Robinson Humphreys opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the MAPICS board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the MAPICS
board of directors or management of MAPICS with respect to the merger or the consideration to be paid by MAPICS in the merger. The consideration to be paid by MAPICS in the merger was determined on the basis of negotiations between MAPICS and
Frontstep. MAPICS decision to enter into the merger was made solely by the MAPICS board of directors based on the numerous factors that it considered. 

The following is a summary of the material financial and comparative analyses presented by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in connection with its opinion to the MAPICS board of directors. 

Analysis of Transaction Structure 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyzed the value of the consideration to be received pursuant to the merger by Frontsteps common and Series A convertible preferred
shareholders based on MAPICS closing stock price on November 22, 2002 and MAPICS average stock price for the 10-day and 30-day trading periods preceding November 22, 2002. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also evaluated these values in
relation to: a) in the case of Frontsteps common shares, Frontsteps closing share price on November 22, 2002 and Frontsteps average stock price for the 10-day and 30-day trading periods preceding November 22, 2002, and b) in the
case of Frontsteps



Series A convertible preferred shares, the liquidation preference of the Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares. The results of this analysis are summarized below.

Analysis of Frontstep 

Market Analysis of Selected Publicly-Traded Companies

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed and compared publicly available financial data, market information and trading multiples for Frontstep with other selected
publicly-traded companies that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant to Frontstep. These companies are: 

Middle-Market ERP Software:

Other ERP Software:

PeopleSoft, Inc. (PSFT)

MAPICS, Inc. (MAPX)

Retek, Inc. (RETK)

QAD, Inc. (QADI)

SAP Corporation (SAP)

For the selected publicly-traded companies, SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey analyzed, among other things, firm value (or market capitalization plus debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of: latest twelve months (LTM) revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA); latest quarter annualized (LQA) revenues and EBITDA; and calendar year 2002 and projected calendar year 2003 revenues. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also compared stock price as a multiple of LTM, calendar
year 2002 and projected calendar year 2003 earnings per share (EPS). All multiples were based on closing stock prices as of November 22, 2002. Historical revenues, EBITDA and EPS results were based on financial information available in
public filings and press releases of the selected companies. Projected revenues and EPS estimates were based on research reports and First Call consensus estimates. First Call is an information provider that publishes a compilation of estimates of
projected financial performance for publicly-traded companies produced by equity research analysts at leading investment banking firms. The following table sets forth the median multiples for Frontstep indicated by the market analysis of selected
publicly-traded companies:

Based upon the multiples derived from this analysis and Frontsteps
historical and projected results, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey calculated a range of implied equity values for Frontstep between $0.72 and $5.62 per share with average and median implied equity values of $2.75 and $2.50 per share, respectively, based
on the group of middle-market ERP software companies, and between $2.03 and $5.19 per share with average and median implied equity values of $3.88 and $4.42 per share, respectively, based on all the selected publicly-traded companies. 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey noted that none of the companies used in the market analysis of selected publicly-traded companies
was identical to Frontstep and that, accordingly, the analysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies reviewed and other factors that would affect
the market values of the selected publicly-traded companies. 

Analysis of Selected Merger and Acquisition
Transactions

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed and analyzed the consideration paid and implied transaction
multiples in 16 selected completed and pending mergers and acquisitions that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant. As part of this analysis, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey considered the selected transactions as a group and also highlighted the
proposed transaction announced on October 28, 2002 between SSA Global Technologies, Inc. and Infinium Software, Inc. 

For the selected transactions, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyzed, among other things, firm value as a multiple of LTM revenues, EBITDA and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT values were
based on historical financial information available in public filings of the acquirer and/or target companies related to the selected transactions. The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis:

Based upon the multiples derived from this analysis and
Frontsteps historical results, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey calculated a range of implied equity values for Frontstep between $0.98 and $6.81 per share with average and median implied equity values of $3.90 per share based on all of the
reference transactions, and between $5.24 and $8.19 with average and median implied equity values of $6.71 per share based on the SSA Global/Infinium transaction. 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey noted that no transaction considered in the analysis of selected merger and acquisition transactions is identical to the merger. All multiples
for the selected transactions were based on public information available at the time of announcement of such transaction, without taking into account differing market and other conditions during the period during which the selected transactions
occurred. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Frontstep based upon projections provided by Frontsteps management for the quarter ending June
30, 2003 and the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004 and 2005 and developed from Frontsteps projections for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2006 and 2007 to estimate the net present equity value per share of Frontstep. SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey calculated a range of net present firm values for Frontstep based on its free cash flow (EBITDA minus capital expenditures



and increases in working capital plus decreases in working capital) over the projected time period using a weighted average cost of capital for the company ranging between 15% to 35% and terminal
value multiples of fiscal year ending June 30, 2007 EBITDA ranging from 3.5x to 5.5x. The analysis indicated the following per share equity valuations of Frontstep:

Premiums Paid Analysis 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyzed the transaction premiums paid in all merger and acquisition transactions of publicly traded
companies with transaction values between $25 and $75 million, effected between January 1, 2002 and November 22, 2002, based on the target companys stock price one day, five days and 30 days prior to public announcement of the transaction.
This analysis indicated the following premiums paid in the selected transactions:

share with average and median implied equity values of $3.14 and $2.87 per share, respectively, based on the median premium paid. 

Analysis of MAPICS 

Market Analysis of Selected Publicly-Traded Companies

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed and compared selected publicly available financial data, market
information and trading multiples for MAPICS with other selected publicly-traded companies that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey deemed relevant to MAPICS. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey used the same group of 15 publicly traded companies for purposes of
analyzing MAPICS that it used to analyze Frontstep with the exception that MAPICS was removed from the group and Frontstep was added. 

For the selected publicly-traded companies, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyzed, among other things, firm value as a multiple of: LTM revenues and EBITDA; LQA revenues and EBITDA; and calendar year 2002 and projected
calendar year 2003 revenues. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also analyzed stock price as a multiple of LTM, calendar year 2002 and projected calendar year 2003 EPS. All multiples were based on closing stock prices as of November 22, 2002. Historical
revenues, EBITDA and EPS results were based on financial information available in public filings and press releases of the selected companies. Projected revenues and EPS estimates were based on research reports and First Call consensus estimates.



Based upon the multiples derived from this analysis and MAPICS historical
and projected results, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey calculated a range of implied equity values for MAPICS between $4.32 and $12.80 per share with average and median implied equity values of $8.40 and $8.45 per share, respectively, based on the group
of publicly-traded middle-market ERP software companies, and between $7.46 and $17.09 per share with average and median implied equity values of $11.63 and $13.51 per share, respectively, based on all the selected publicly-traded companies.

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey noted that none of the companies used in the market analysis of selected
publicly-traded companies was identical to MAPICS and that, accordingly, the analysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies reviewed and other
factors that would affect the market values of the selected publicly-traded companies. 

Pro Forma Merger
Analysis 

Accretion/Dilution Analysis

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed certain of the pro forma financial effects of the merger on MAPICS, assuming that the merger closes on March 31, 2003, for the fiscal
years ending September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey performed two analyses using base revenue case projections and reduced revenue case projections provided by MAPICS and Frontstep. For each of these scenarios,
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also evaluated the pro forma effect of the merger assuming two different levels of estimated annual cost savings (a base case and a reduced case) as directed by MAPICS, and that such savings would be realized gradually
over time as directed by MAPICS. 

In the base revenue case scenario, the merger was determined to be accretive to
MAPICS projected EPS for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2003 and 2004, assuming both the base case and reduced case of estimated annual cost savings. In the reduced revenue scenario, the merger was determined to be dilutive to
MAPICS projected EPS for the year ending September 30, 2003 and accretive for the year ending September 30, 2004, assuming both the base case and reduced case of estimated annual cost savings. 

Pro Forma Combination Analysis

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey reviewed the relative contribution that MAPICS and Frontstep would make to the pro forma combined company in terms of revenues, EBITDA and net income for the LTM ended
September 30, 2002 and the projected fiscal years ending September 30, 2003 and 2004. The relative contribution of Frontstep to the combined entitys pro forma financial results ranged from a high of 40.7% (based on LTM ended September 30, 2002
revenues) to a low of 16.9% based on LTM ended September 30, 2002 EBITDA. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey noted that Frontstep had negative net income for the LTM ended September 30, 2002 and projects negative net income for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2003; therefore



contribution analyses based on these measures were not meaningful. The following table summarizes the relative contribution MAPICS and Frontstep would make to the pro forma combined company based
on the selected financial measures:

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey noted that pursuant to the merger MAPICS

Other Factors and Analyses 

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey took
into consideration various other factors and analyses, including: historical market prices and trading volumes for MAPICS common stock and Frontstep common shares; movements in the common stock of selected publicly-traded companies; movements in the
S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index; and analyses of the weighted average costs of capital of selected publicly-traded companies. 

Information Regarding SunTrust Robinson Humphrey

The
MAPICS board of directors selected SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to act as its financial advisor and render a fairness opinion regarding the merger because SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger and because it is familiar with MAPICS, its business and its industry. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has from time to time rendered, and may in the future render, investment banking, financial advisory
and other services to MAPICS for which it has received, or will receive, customary compensation. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities and private placements. 

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 22, 2002, MAPICS has paid SunTrust Robinson Humphrey an opinion fee of $250,000 which was payable upon delivery of the fairness opinion, less applicable retainers. In addition, MAPICS has
agreed to pay SunTrust Robinson Humphrey a financial advisory fee at closing of the merger equal to 1.25% of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger, less amounts previously paid and subject to certain limitations. The fees
paid or payable to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey are not contingent upon the contents of the opinion delivered. MAPICS also has agreed to reimburse SunTrust Robinson Humphrey for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, subject to certain limitations,
and to indemnify SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and certain related persons against certain liabilities arising out of or in conjunction with its rendering of services under its engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws. 

In the ordinary course of its business, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey may actively trade in the securities of
MAPICS and Frontstep for its own account and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time



hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is currently MAPICS broker in connection with its stock repurchase program, and earns customary
commissions for open market purchases made under the program. MAPICS also maintains investments at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, and pays SunTrust Robinson Humphrey customary fees in connection with its management of these investments. The investments
made by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on behalf of MAPICS have historically included various money market mutual funds and commercial paper. 

MAPICS maintains its primary banking relationship with SunTrust Banks, Inc., of which SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is a wholly owned subsidiary. As a part of this relationship MAPICS pays SunTrust Banks
various banking fees in the ordinary course of business and receives interest income from SunTrust Banks on its bank accounts. 

In January 2000, MAPICS entered into a $60.0 million bank facility with a bank syndicate in which SunTrust Banks had 21.7% participation. The bank facility consisted of a $40.0 million term loan and a $20.0 million revolving
loan. MAPICS paid customary loan origination and loan amendment fees as well as interest expense and unused line fees to this bank syndicate until the bank facility was terminated in April 2002. 

In April 2000, MAPICS entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with SunTrust Banks to convert a portion of the variable rate interest under the January 2000
bank facility to a fixed rate. Under the terms of the swap, MAPICS paid SunTrust Banks interest expense during MAPICS fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. The swap arrangement ended on December 31, 2001. 

In April 2002, MAPICS terminated its January 2000 bank credit facility and entered into a new $10.0 million secured revolving credit loan
with SunTrust Banks as the sole lender. The revolving credit loan expires in April 2003. In connection with the loan, MAPICS paid SunTrust Banks customary origination and other fees. MAPICS does not currently have any amounts outstanding under the
SunTrust Banks revolving credit facility. 

In September 2002, MAPICS began using SunTrust Banks as its stock
transfer agent and rights agent for a customary annual fee. 

MAPICS is currently in discussions with SunTrust
Banks and other financial institutions regarding additional debt financing, the proceeds of which would be used in part to refinance the Frontstep debt that will be assumed by MAPICS pursuant to the merger. SunTrust Banks also may act as the
exchange agent for the shares to be issued in connection with the merger. 

Opinion of William Blair & Company, L.L.C. 

Frontstep retained William Blair to
render an opinion as to whether the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding Frontstep common shares. On November 24, 2002, William Blair delivered an oral opinion,
later confirmed in writing as of that date, to the Frontstep board of directors that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to the holders of outstanding
Frontstep common shares from a financial point of view. 

The full text of William Blairs written
opinion, dated November 24, 2002, is attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annex D and is incorporated herein by reference. William Blairs opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, to the holders of the outstanding Frontstep common shares of the exchange ratio. You should read the entire opinion carefully to learn about the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limits of the scope
of William Blairs review in rendering its opinion. The summary herein of William Blairs opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. William Blairs opinion was addressed to Frontsteps
board of directors for the purpose of its evaluation of the merger and is not a recommendation to any Frontstep shareholder as to how to vote on the merger proposal. 



Information Considered by William Blair 

In connection with its opinion, William Blair reviewed, among other things: 



the November 22, 2002 draft of the merger agreement and the draft shareholder agreements referenced therein; 



a draft restructuring agreement pursuant to which the holders of Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares proposed to agree to convert their Frontstep
Series A convertible preferred shares into a stipulated number of Frontstep common shares and the holders of Frontstep note warrants, as defined in the merger agreement, proposed to agree to exercise the note warrants and to receive, upon exercise
thereof, a stipulated number of Frontstep common shares; 



certain audited historical financial statements of Frontstep for the three years ended June 30, 2002; 



certain audited and unaudited historical financial statements of MAPICS for the three years ended September 30, 2002; 



the unaudited financial statements of Frontstep for the three months ended September 30, 2002, provided by management; 



certain internal business, operating and financial information and forecasts of Frontstep and MAPICS, prepared by the senior management of Frontstep and MAPICS,
respectively; 



information regarding certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger prepared by the senior management of MAPICS;



the pro forma impact of the merger on the earnings per share of MAPICS (before and after taking into consideration any goodwill created as a result of the
merger) based on certain pro forma financial information prepared by the senior management of MAPICS; 



information relating to the terms and conditions of Frontsteps amended credit agreements and the possible financial impact on Frontstep of failing to
comply with such agreements; 



information regarding publicly available financial terms of certain other business combinations William Blair deemed relevant; 



the financial position and operating results of Frontstep compared with those of certain other publicly traded companies William Blair deemed relevant;



current and historical market prices and trading volumes of the Frontstep common shares and MAPICS common stock; and 



certain other publicly available information on Frontstep and MAPICS. 

William Blair also held discussions with members of the senior management of Frontstep and MAPICS to discuss the foregoing, considered other matters which it deemed
relevant to its inquiry and took into account such accepted financial and investment banking procedures and considerations as it deemed relevant. 

In rendering its opinion, William Blair assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all the information examined by or otherwise reviewed or discussed
with it for purposes of its opinion, including without limitation the forecasts provided by senior management. William Blair did not make or obtain an independent valuation or appraisal of the assets, liabilities or solvency of Frontstep or MAPICS.
William Blair was advised by the senior management of Frontstep and MAPICS that the forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of Frontstep and MAPICS, as the
case may be. In that regard, William Blair assumed, with the consent of Frontstep and MAPICS, that: 



the forecasts will be achieved in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby; and 





all material assets and liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Frontstep were as set forth in Frontsteps financial statements or other information made
available to William Blair. 

William Blair expressed no opinion with respect to the forecasts
or the estimates and judgments on which they were based. 

In its opinion, William Blair noted that: 



William Blair was not requested to consider, and its opinion does not address, any operating synergies or projected combined benefits that might result from the
merger; 



William Blair was not requested to, and did not, participate in the negotiation or structuring of the merger or the merger agreement; 



William Blair was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not address, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies
that might exist for Frontstep or the effect of any other transaction in which Frontstep might engage; 



William Blair assumed the conversion of all outstanding Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares into Frontstep common shares and the exercise of all
Frontstep note warrants for Frontstep common shares, in each case in accordance with the restructuring agreement; 



William Blair was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not address, the relative merits of or any considerations (financial or otherwise) relating to the
restructuring agreement or any conversion of the outstanding Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares into Frontstep common shares or the exercise of the Frontstep note warrants for Frontstep common shares; 



William Blair was not rendering any opinion with respect to the Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares or Frontstep note warrants or with respect to
the holders of the Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares or Frontstep note warrants in such capacity; and 



William Blair was engaged by Frontstep solely for the purpose of evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
Frontstep common shares of the exchange ratio. 

William Blair also noted that, in February
2002, Frontstep engaged Updata to serve as its financial advisor with respect to the evaluation and possible consummation of its strategic and financial alternatives which would likely result in the sale or merger of Frontstep. William Blair was
advised by Updata that, in its marketing process for Frontstep, Updata: 



identified prospective partners; 



initiated discussions with 35 potential acquirers; 



received signed confidentiality agreements from 17 potential acquirers; 



received preliminary indication of interest from three potential acquirers; 



had three potential acquirers conduct due diligence; and 



received only one definitive proposal for a transaction with Frontstep, which was from MAPICS. 

William Blair was not requested to, and did not, solicit indications of interest from any person. 

William Blair also took into account, among other things: 



that Frontstep has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience in the near future, difficulty in generating new software license revenue;





in eight of the last nine quarters Frontstep has missed its internal revenue projections; 



although Frontstep has significantly cut operating expenses, Frontstep has struggled to achieve profitability; 



since Frontstep entered into its current credit facility with Foothill on July 17, 2001, Frontstep has amended the credit facility eight times and has been
unable to consistently satisfy the financial covenants required by Foothill; 



under the eighth amendment to Frontsteps current credit facility, Foothill had the ability to terminate its commitment to fund Frontstep if Frontstep
failed (1) to deliver a signed transaction agreement by a qualified buyer that would assume the Foothill obligations; or (2) to engage, by a specified date, an investment banking firm acceptable to Foothill to develop a business plan to sell
Frontstep, raise capital or complete a financial restructuring by a specified date; 



without working capital funding from Foothill, Frontstep faced a severe cash flow shortage that management believed would jeopardize Frontsteps ability to
meet its basic obligations; and 



Frontsteps inability to secure acceptable alternative financing given the current credit and equity markets and Frontsteps financial condition.

William Blairs opinion was based upon economic, market, financial and other conditions
existing on, and other information disclosed to it as of, November 24, 2002. It should be understood that, although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, William Blair does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this
opinion. William Blair assumed that the merger would be consummated on the terms described in the draft merger agreement furnished to it, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions by Frontstep. 

The following discussion summarizes the material financial analyses William Blair performed in arriving at its opinion. William Blair
reviewed with the Frontstep board of directors the assumptions upon which its analyses were based, as well as other factors, on November 24, 2002. William Blair noted that it did not perform a discounted cash flow analysis. While Frontstep
management provided William Blair with internal operating projections through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, historical fluctuations in Frontsteps actual results as compared to Frontsteps internal projections led William Blair to
conclude that a meaningful discounted cash flow analysis could not be completed. William Blair also noted that its analysis was based on financial information reported by Frontstep prior to Frontsteps restatement of its last two fiscal year
financials. William Blair further noted that such restatements do not have a material effect on Frontsteps results for such periods and do not affect the conclusions reached by William Blair. The summary set forth below is not a complete
description of the analyses performed or factors considered by William Blair. 

Analysis of Selected Publicly
Traded Companies Comparable to Frontstep.
    William Blair reviewed and compared certain financial information relating to Frontstep to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples for publicly
traded companies that it deemed most comparable to Frontstep based on their industry, market capitalization and revenues. These publicly traded companies included: American Software, Epicor Software Corp., Made2Manage Systems, Inc., QAD, Inc., Ross
Systems, Inc. and Timberline Software Corp. William Blair noted that none of the selected companies is identical to Frontstep. Accordingly, any analysis of the selected publicly traded companies necessarily involved complex considerations and
judgments concerning the differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that would necessarily affect the analysis of trading multiples of the selected publicly traded companies. 

Among the information William Blair considered were the latest twelve months revenue and the latest twelve months EBITDA. The multiples
for the comparable companies were based on the most recent publicly available financial information for each company and used the closing share prices as of November 22, 2002. The implied multiples for Frontstep were based on the most recently
available financial information as provided by Frontstep management and the merger exchange ratio. 



William Blair calculated the multiples of enterprise value to revenue and EBITDA.
Enterprise value is the equity value of the common equity based on the stock price plus the book value of total debt less cash and cash equivalents. William Blair then compared these multiples to the relevant Frontstep multiples implied by the terms
of the merger. Information regarding the multiples implied by the terms of the merger compared to the multiples from William Blairs analysis of selected comparable publicly traded companies is set forth in the following table.

William Blair noted that the implied acquisition multiples for

Comparable Transactions Analysis.
    William Blair performed an analysis of selected recent merger or acquisition transactions. The selected transactions were chosen based on
William Blairs judgment that they were generally comparable, in whole or in part, to the proposed transaction based on the targets industry, public company status, transaction value and revenues. In total, William Blair examined 14
relevant transactions that were announced after January 1, 2000. Although William Blair compared the transaction multiples of these companies to the implied acquisition multiples of Frontstep, none of the selected companies or transactions is
identical to Frontstep or the merger. 

William Blair reviewed the consideration paid in such transactions in terms
of the enterprise value of such transactions as a multiple of latest twelve months revenue prior to transaction announcement and to calendar year-end post transaction announcement projected revenue. Since a majority of the companies William Blair
selected generated negative EBITDA, William Blair determined it would be inappropriate to consider the few corresponding trading multiples as relevant when determining the fairness of the merger price.

Merger Premiums Analysis.
    In addition to evaluating multiples paid in transactions, William Blair considered, for the 310 completed public company transactions and the 121 completed public
technology sector transactions announced since January 1, 2001, whose equity value ranged from $50.0 million to $250.0 million, the premiums (or discounts) paid over each companys stock price one day, one week and one month prior to the
announcement of a transaction. This analysis was based on the closing price of Frontstep common shares as of November 22, 2002.

William Blair noted that approximately 15% of the 310 closed public
transactions and approximately 12% of the 121 closed public technology sectors transactions were completed at a discount or parity (defined as premiums up to 5%). William Blair noted that the merger premium implied by the merger exchange ratio was
within the range of the mergers considered in this analysis. 

Pro Forma Merger
Analysis.
    William Blair also performed pro forma historical analyses of the financial impact of the merger as of September 30, 2002 using the unaudited financials provided by Frontstep management for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2002 and the unaudited financial results of MAPICS for the twelve months ended September 30, 2002 provided in their October 30, 2002 press release. William Blair did not address in its opinion any operating synergies that might
result from the merger. William Blair assumed, however, operating synergies, per estimates provided by Frontstep and MAPICS management and their advisors, and that MAPICS had sufficient net operating losses to exclude the tax impact of the assumed
operating synergies. William Blair compared the earnings per share of the MAPICS common stock on a stand-alone basis to the earnings per share of the common stock of the surviving corporation in the merger on a pro forma basis. William Blair assumed
the merger would be accounted for using purchase accounting. Based on an analysis of the merger, the impact of the proposed transaction would have been approximately 18% accretive per share of MAPICS in this pro forma historical analysis.

General.
    This summary is not a complete description of the analysis performed by
William Blair but contains all material elements of the analysis. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. The preparation of a fairness opinion does not involve a mathematical evaluation or weighing of the results of the
individual analyses performed, but requires William Blair to exercise its professional judgment, based on its experience and expertise in considering a wide variety of analyses taken as a whole. Each of the analyses conducted by William Blair was
carried out in order to provide a different perspective on the merger and add to the total mix of information available. The analyses were prepared solely for the purposes of William Blair providing its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of outstanding Frontstep common shares of the merger exchange ratio and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which securities actually may be sold. William Blair did not form a conclusion
as to whether any individual analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion as to fairness. Rather, in reaching its conclusion, William Blair considered the results of the analyses in light of each other and ultimately
reached its opinion based on the results of all analyses taken as a whole. William Blair did not place particular reliance or weight on any particular analysis, but instead concluded its analyses, taken as a whole, supported its determination.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, William Blair believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses
and factors, may create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Frontstep or the contemplated merger. In performing its
analyses, William Blair made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic conditions and



other matters. The analyses performed by William Blair are not necessarily indicative of future actual values and future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. 

William Blair has been engaged in the investment banking business since 1935. It continually
undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection with public offerings, private placements, business combinations, estate and gift tax valuations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of its business, William Blair may from
time to time trade in the securities of Frontstep or MAPICS for its own account and for the accounts of customers, and accordingly may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. William Blair was engaged by Frontstep solely for
the purpose of evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding Frontstep common shares of the merger exchange ratio and to render an opinion thereon and received a fee from Frontstep for its services. In
addition, Frontstep has agreed to indemnify William Blair against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement. 

The Frontstep board of directors hired William Blair based on its qualifications and expertise in providing financial advice to companies and as a nationally recognized investment banking firm. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated
February 15, 2002, the total fee payable to William Blair upon delivery of its opinion is $200,000. Furthermore, Frontstep has agreed to reimburse William Blair for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 

William Blair was not retained as an advisor or agent to Frontstep shareholders or any other person, but rather was retained solely to
provide an opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger exchange ratio to the holders of outstanding Frontstep common shares. The Frontstep board of directors and MAPICS determined the exchange ratio in arms-length
negotiations. The Frontstep board of directors did not impose any restrictions or limitations upon William Blair with respect to the investigations made or the procedures that William Blair followed in rendering its opinion. 

Completion of the Merger 

Subject to the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to effect the merger, the merger will be completed on the date and at the time the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio becomes effective and the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Georgia becomes effective. Unless MAPICS and Frontstep agree otherwise, they will use reasonable efforts to complete the merger on the first business day after the last to occur of: 



the effective date of the last required consent of any regulatory authority having authority over the merger; and 



the date or dates on which Frontstep shareholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and MAPICS shareholders approve the issuance of shares of
MAPICS common stock in the merger. 

MAPICS and Frontstep anticipate that the merger will
become effective on or about February 18, 2003. However, delays could occur. Moreover, MAPICS and Frontstep cannot assure you that they will be able to obtain necessary shareholder approvals for the merger or that they will be able to satisfy other
conditions to completion of the merger. Either Frontstep or MAPICS may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by April 30, 2003, unless the merger has not been completed because of the breach of the merger agreement by the
party seeking termination. See Conditions to Completion of the Merger and Waiver, Amendment and Termination. 

Distribution of MAPICS Stock Certificates 

Promptly after the merger is completed, each
Frontstep shareholder at the time of completion of the merger will be mailed a letter of transmittal and instructions for the exchange of the certificates representing Frontstep common shares for certificates representing shares of MAPICS common
stock. 



You should not send in your Frontstep share certificates until you receive
a letter of transmittal and instructions. 

After you surrender to the exchange agent your Frontstep share
certificates with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the exchange agent will mail you a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of MAPICS common stock to which you are entitled and a check for the cash amount to be
paid in lieu of any fractional share, if any, without interest, together with all undelivered dividends or distributions in respect of the shares of MAPICS common stock, if any, without interest. MAPICS will not be obligated to deliver the merger
consideration to you, as a former Frontstep shareholder, until you have surrendered your Frontstep share certificates. 

Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by MAPICS on MAPICS common stock with a record date on or after the date on which the merger is completed, the declaration will include dividends or other distributions on all
shares of MAPICS common stock that may be issued in the merger. However, MAPICS will not pay any dividend or other distribution that is payable after the completion of the merger to any former Frontstep shareholder who has not surrendered his or her
Frontstep share certificates until the holder surrenders the certificates. If any shareholders Frontstep share certificate has been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the shares of MAPICS common stock and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares upon the shareholders submission of an affidavit claiming the Frontstep share certificate to be lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, the posting of a bond in such amount as MAPICS and the exchange agent may
reasonably require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against MAPICS with respect to the Frontstep share certificate, and submission of any other documents necessary to effect the exchange of the Frontstep common shares represented by
the Frontstep share certificate. 

At the time the merger is completed, the share transfer books of Frontstep will
be closed to Frontstep shareholders and no transfer of Frontstep common shares by any shareholder will thereafter be made or recognized. If Frontstep share certificates are presented for transfer after the merger is completed, they will be canceled
and exchanged for shares of MAPICS common stock, the cash amount due in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and undelivered dividends on the MAPICS common stock, if any. 

Conditions to Completion of the Merger 

MAPICS and Frontstep are required to complete
the merger only after the satisfaction of various conditions. These conditions include: 



the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Frontstep common shares must have adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger;

Frontstep and MAPICS must have performed all agreements and complied with all covenants set forth in the merger agreement in all material respects;

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger 

MAPICS has agreed to use its reasonable efforts
to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger as soon as reasonably practicable and not to take any action that would materially adversely affect any partys ability to obtain any consents required for the merger or materially
adversely affect any partys ability to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement. The merger agreement also obligates MAPICS to continue to conduct its business in a manner designed in its reasonable judgment to enhance
the long-term value of MAPICS common stock and the business prospects of MAPICS before the merger is completed. 

Frontstep has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement and not to take any action that would adversely affect
any partys ability to obtain any consents required for the merger or adversely affect any partys ability to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement. The merger agreement also obligates Frontstep to conduct its
business only in the usual, regular and ordinary course before the merger is completed and imposes certain limitations on the operations of Frontstep and its subsidiaries. 

Waiver, Amendment and Termination 

To the extent permitted by law, MAPICS and Frontstep
may agree in writing to amend the merger agreement, whether before or after the proposals related to the merger are approved by the shareholders of Frontstep and MAPICS. However, after shareholder approval is obtained, the parties will not make
amendments that, pursuant to applicable law, require further shareholder approval without obtaining such approval. In addition, before or at the time the merger is completed, either Frontstep or MAPICS, or both, may waive any default in the
performance of any term of the merger agreement by the other party or may waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by the other party of any and all of its obligations under the merger agreement. In addition, either MAPICS or
Frontstep may waive any of the conditions precedent to its obligations under the merger agreement, unless a violation of any law or governmental regulation would result. To be effective, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized
officer of Frontstep or MAPICS, as the case may be. 

At any time before the completion of the merger, the boards
of directors of MAPICS and Frontstep may agree by mutual written consent to terminate the merger agreement. In addition, either MAPICS or Frontstep may terminate the merger agreement by written notice of termination to the other party specifying the
reason for termination in the following circumstances: 



if there is a breach by the other party of any representation or warranty contained in the merger agreement which cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days
after the giving of written notice to the



breaching party of such breach and which breach is likely, in the opinion of the non-breaching party, to permit that party to refuse to complete the merger pursuant to the conditions discussed in
Conditions to Completion of the Merger; provided that, the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement; 



if there is a material breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement which cannot be or has not been cured within 30
days after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach; provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement;



if any consent of any regulatory authority required to complete the merger has been denied by final nonappealable action, or if any action taken by such
authority is not appealed within the time limit for appeal, or any law or order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger has become final and nonappealable; 



if the Frontstep shareholders fail to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger or the shareholders of MAPICS fail to approve the issuance of MAPICS
common stock in the merger at their respective meetings; 



if the merger is not completed by April 30, 2003, unless the merger has not been completed because of the breach of the merger agreement by the party seeking
termination (we refer to April 30, 2003 as the outside date); or 



in the event that any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such party to complete the merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by the outside date.

In addition, MAPICS also may terminate the merger agreement by written notice of termination
to Frontstep, if: 



the Frontstep board of directors fails to reaffirm its approval of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to the exclusion of any
other acquisition proposal (as more specifically discussed in Solicitation Prohibitions), or if the Frontstep board of directors resolves not to reaffirm the merger; 



the Frontstep board of directors withholds, withdraws, qualifies or modifies, or proposes publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
MAPICS, its recommendation to Frontstep shareholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; 



the Frontstep board of directors affirms, recommends or authorizes entering into any other acquisition transaction, as defined in Section 11.1 of the merger
agreement, other than the merger or, within ten business days after commencement of any tender or exchange offer for any Frontstep common shares, the Frontstep board of directors fails to recommend against acceptance of the tender or exchange offer
by Frontstep shareholders or takes no position with respect to the acceptance of the tender or exchange offer by its shareholders; 



the Frontstep board of directors negotiates or authorizes negotiations with a third party, other than the provision of information to third parties in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, regarding an acquisition proposal other than the merger; or 



any person, other than MAPICS or its subsidiaries, acquires beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Frontstep common shares after the date of the
merger agreement. 

We refer to a termination by MAPICS as a result of any of the immediately foregoing as a
Frontstep withdrawal termination. 

If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and have
no effect, except that certain provisions of the merger agreement, including those regarding the payment of expenses and the termination fee and



maintaining the confidentiality of certain information obtained, will survive. Termination of the merger agreement will not relieve any breaching party from liability for any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement. 

Board Recommendation 

The boards of directors of MAPICS and Frontstep have unanimously
approved the merger agreement and unanimously agreed to recommend and, subject to the conditions discussed below, not to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation that their respective shareholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, in the case of Frontstep shareholders, and vote to approve the issuance of shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger, in the case of MAPICS shareholders. 

However, in response to the receipt of a superior proposal, the Frontstep board of directors may withdraw, qualify or modify,
or propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or modify, its recommendation in favor of the merger, and may approve or recommend that its shareholders accept another acquisition proposal (we refer to any of the foregoing actions, whether by the
Frontstep board of directors or a committee thereof, as a subsequent determination recommendation). However, the Frontstep board of directors may effect a subsequent determination recommendation only if all of the following conditions
are met: 



a superior proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn; 



Frontstep shareholders have not adopted the merger agreement; 



MAPICS must have received from Frontstep, at least three days prior to such subsequent determination recommendation, written notice stating expressly (a) that
it has received a superior proposal, (b) the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal and the identity of the person or group making the superior proposal and (c) that it intends to effect a subsequent determination recommendation;



MAPICS must have received from Frontstep, at least three days prior to such subsequent determination recommendation, a copy of all written materials delivered
to the person or group making the superior proposal in connection with such superior proposal; and 



MAPICS must have been provided an opportunity to make, prior to the expiration of the third business day following MAPICS receipt of the foregoing
information, such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would enable Frontstep to proceed without a subsequent determination recommendation. 

A superior proposal is defined in the merger agreement to mean: 



an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination, all or substantially all of the assets of Frontstep or all of the total outstanding voting securities of Frontstep; and 



an offer on terms that the Frontstep board of directors has in good faith concluded (based on, among other things, the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the person making the offer, to be more favorable to Frontstep shareholders (in their capacities as
shareholders) than the terms of the merger and is reasonably capable of being completed. 

The
obligation of Frontstep to call, give notice of, convene and hold its shareholders meeting is not affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Frontstep of any acquisition proposal with respect to it, or by any
subsequent determination recommendation. 



Solicitation Prohibitions 

The merger agreement restricts Frontsteps ability to
solicit other acquisition proposals. Frontstep has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement
with respect to any acquisition proposal, which is defined in the merger agreement to mean any offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving: 



any purchase from Frontstep, or acquisition by any person or group, of 20% or more interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Frontstep or any of
its subsidiaries; 



any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of Frontstep or any of its subsidiaries; 



any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Frontstep pursuant to which Frontstep shareholders immediately prior to such
transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity; 



any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or
disposition of 20% or more of the assets of Frontstep; or 



any liquidation or dissolution of Frontstep. 

The merger agreement also provides that neither Frontstep nor any of its affiliates or representatives will solicit any competing acquisition proposal. If Frontstep receives an acquisition proposal, it
must promptly notify MAPICS of the terms of such proposal. Frontstep may provide third parties with confidential information, have discussions and negotiations with third parties, or otherwise facilitate an effort or attempt by a third party to make
or implement an acquisition proposal not solicited in violation of the merger agreement if: 



the Frontstep board of directors determines in good faith (based on, among other things, the advice of its financial advisor) that the acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal; 



at least two business days prior to providing any information, the Frontstep board of directors notifies MAPICS of its intent to provide such information and
Frontstep receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with provisions no less favorable to Frontstep than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between MAPICS and Frontstep; and 



Frontstep provides such information to the third party and MAPICS simultaneously. 

Effect of the Merger on Frontstep Options 

In the merger, MAPICS will assume each
option granted under Frontsteps stock option plans in accordance with the terms of the relevant Frontstep stock option plan and the stock option agreement that evidences the option and will deliver MAPICS common stock upon the exercise of each
assumed option. After the merger is completed: 



MAPICS and its compensation committee will be substituted for Frontstep and the committee of the Frontstep board of directors administering Frontsteps
stock option plans; 



each option assumed by MAPICS may be exercised only for shares of MAPICS common stock (or cash, if so provided under the terms of the Frontstep option);



the number of shares of MAPICS common stock subject to the assumed option will be equal to the number of Frontstep common shares subject to the option
immediately before the merger is completed multiplied by the exchange ratio; and 



the per share exercise price of each assumed option will be adjusted by dividing it by the exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. 



MAPICS will not issue any fractional shares of common stock upon exercise of an
assumed option. Instead, MAPICS will pay cash for any fractional share based upon the difference between the exercise price of the assumed option and the last sale price per share of MAPICS common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
exercise date. 

For information with respect to options held by Frontsteps directors and executive officers,
see Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

MAPICS and Frontstep have not
sought, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the federal income tax consequences of the merger. The opinions of Alston & Bird LLP, counsel to MAPICS, and Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP, counsel to
Frontstep, as to certain of the expected federal income tax consequences of the merger are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus is a part and support the following discussion of the
anticipated federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Frontstep common shares. The opinions are based in part upon certain factual assumptions and upon certain factual representations made by MAPICS and Frontstep, which
representations Alston & Bird LLP and Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP have relied upon and assumed to be true, correct and complete. If such representations are inaccurate, the opinions could be adversely affected. In addition, the opinions
assume that the amount of cash that will be paid to holders of Frontstep common shares who perfect dissenters rights will not exceed the fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the merger consideration such dissenting
shareholders would have received if they had exchanged their Frontstep common shares for shares of MAPICS common stock pursuant to the merger. Opinions of tax counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, either of which
could take a contrary position. This discussion is based on current law. Future legislative, judicial or administrative interpretations, which may be retroactive, could alter or modify the statements set forth in this discussion. This discussion
does not address, among other matters: 



state, local or foreign tax consequences of the merger; 



the tax consequences to Frontstep shareholders who hold their Frontstep common shares other than as a capital asset, who hold their Frontstep common shares in a
hedging transaction or as part of a straddle or conversion transaction or who are subject to special rules under the Internal Revenue Code, such as foreign persons, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, financial institutions, and dealers
in stocks and securities; 



the tax consequences to Frontstep shareholders who received their shares upon the exercise of stock options, stock purchase plan rights, or otherwise as
compensation; 



the tax consequences of transactions taking place immediately before or concurrently with the merger including, but not limited to, the conversion of Frontstep
Series A convertible preferred shares or warrants into Frontstep common shares and the modification of the terms of any warrants; 



the tax consequences to the holders of notes issued by Frontstep; 



the tax consequences to the holders of options to acquire Frontstep common shares; 



the tax consequences to Frontstep shareholders of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any consideration in exchange for services, agreements or any other
property other than Frontstep common shares; and 



the tax consequences to MAPICS and Frontstep of any income and deferred gain recognized pursuant to Treasury Regulations issued under Section 1502 of the
Internal Revenue Code. 

Assuming that the merger is consummated in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, it is anticipated that the following federal income tax consequences will occur: 



the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and each of MAPICS, Frontstep and FP Acquisition
Sub, Inc. will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; 





no gain or loss will be recognized by MAPICS, FP Acquisition Sub, Inc. or Frontstep as a result of the merger; 



no gain or loss will be recognized by Frontstep shareholders upon their exchange of Frontstep common shares for MAPICS common stock pursuant to the merger;



the tax basis of MAPICS common stock received by the Frontstep shareholders pursuant to the merger will be the same as the tax basis of the Frontstep common
shares surrendered in exchange therefor; 



for tax purposes, the holding period of the MAPICS common stock received by a Frontstep shareholder in the merger will include the holding period of the
Frontstep common shares surrendered in exchange therefor, provided that such Frontstep common shares were held as a capital asset by the exchanging Frontstep shareholder on the date of the exchange; 



a Frontstep shareholder who receives cash in lieu of fractional share interests of MAPICS common stock will recognize gain or loss as if the fractional shares
were distributed as part of the exchange and then were redeemed by MAPICS; such redemption will be subject to the conditions and limitations of Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code; and 



a Frontstep shareholder who perfects his or her dissenters rights and who receives payment of the fair market value of his or her Frontstep common shares
will recognize gain or loss as if such payment were received in redemption of the Frontstep common shares; such redemption will be subject to the conditions and limitations of Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

The obligation of MAPICS and Frontstep to complete the merger is conditioned on, among other things, receipt
by MAPICS of an opinion of Alston & Bird LLP and by Frontstep of an opinion of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP, with respect to certain of the federal income tax consequences of the merger. The conditions relating to the receipt of the tax
opinion may be waived by both MAPICS and Frontstep. Neither MAPICS nor Frontstep currently intends to waive the conditions relating to the receipt of the tax opinions. 

The foregoing discussion is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential federal income tax consequences of the
merger. Frontstep shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the merger. 

Accounting Treatment 

MAPICS will account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations. See Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Information. 

Stock Exchange Listing 

MAPICS will use reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market prior to the completion of the merger. 

Expenses and Fees 

Except as discussed below, each of MAPICS and Frontstep will pay all
expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the merger. MAPICS and Frontstep have agreed, however, to share equally the expenses incurred in relation to the printing and filing of the registration statement and this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the merger is consummated, MAPICS shall pay or assume all
of the expenses of Frontstep that are solely and directly related to the merger. 



Frontstep has agreed to pay MAPICS a termination fee of $1.5 million plus the
amount of MAPICS reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the merger, in the following circumstances: 



either MAPICS or Frontstep terminates the merger agreement because the outside date has passed and (1) an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced and
not withdrawn or (2) Frontstep has failed to perform and comply in all material respects with any of its obligations, agreements or covenants required by the merger agreement, and within twelve months of such termination Frontstep shall either (a)
complete a transaction involving an acquisition proposal relating to 50% of its, or one of its subsidiaries, capital stock or assets or (b) enter into an agreement with respect to such a transaction, whether or not the transaction is
subsequently completed; 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because Frontstep has materially breached a covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement and within twelve
months of the termination Frontstep shall either (a) complete a transaction involving an acquisition proposal relating to 50% of its, or one of its subsidiaries, capital stock or assets or (b) enter into an agreement with respect to such a
transaction, whether or not the transaction is subsequently completed; 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement because Frontstep shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; or 



MAPICS terminates the merger agreement pursuant to a Frontstep withdrawal termination discussed above under Waiver, Amendment and Termination.

If the termination fee is payable as a result of one of the first two reasons above, the
termination fee must be paid at or prior to the earlier of the date of completion of the acquisition transaction or the date of execution of an agreement with respect to the acquisition transaction. If the termination fee is payable as a result of
the third or fourth reason above, the termination fee must be paid no later than two business days from the date the merger agreement is terminated. 

The parties have agreed that the payment of the fees and expenses discussed above are not to be deemed liquidated damages for the willful breach by Frontstep of the terms of the merger agreement and do
not otherwise limit the rights of MAPICS. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

In considering the recommendation of the
Frontstep board of directors and its corporate development committee to vote for approval of the merger agreement and the recommendation of the MAPICS board of directors to vote in favor of the issuance of MAPICS common stock in the merger, you
should be aware that some members of Frontsteps executive management and the Frontstep board of directors have interests in the merger that are different from, and in addition to, the interests of other Frontstep and MAPICS shareholders. The
corporate development committee and the Frontstep board of directors were aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in approving the merger and the merger agreement. 

Employment AgreementStephen A. Sasser.
    Frontstep has an employment agreement dated July 5, 1995, as amended on April 1, 1997 and
December 15, 1998, with Stephen A. Sasser, president and chief executive officer of Frontstep. Mr. Sasser also is a director of Frontstep. The original term of the employment agreement ended on July 5, 2002, at which time it was automatically
renewed for an additional year. The employment agreement will continue to be automatically renewed for one additional year on each July 4 unless Frontstep or Mr. Sasser provides notice of non-renewal at least 150 days or 120 days, respectively,
before the expiration of the renewal term. Additionally, Mr. Sasser may terminate the employment agreement at any time following a change in control of Frontstep unless, within five business days after the change in control, Frontstep requests that
he remain employed under the terms of the employment agreement for an additional 180 days. The merger will constitute a change in control under the employment agreement. 



Under the employment agreement, Mr. Sasser agrees to serve as president and chief executive officer of Frontstep. He
further agrees to serve as a director of Frontstep and as an officer and/or director of any of Frontsteps subsidiaries, if elected. The employment agreement also requires Mr. Sasser to maintain the confidentiality of Frontsteps trade
secrets and proprietary information at all times and prohibits Mr. Sasser from competing with Frontstep or soliciting employees and certain customers of Frontstep for a period of one year following the termination of his employment. 

Mr. Sassers employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of not less than $272,000 and annual target bonus
compensation of $188,000 pursuant to a plan approved by the Frontstep compensation committee and based on Frontsteps achievement of annual targets and objectives. In June 2000, the Frontstep compensation committee increased Mr. Sassers
base salary to $300,000 and target bonus to $200,000. The employment agreement also requires Frontstep to maintain for Mr. Sasser long-term disability insurance with an annual benefit of not less than $250,000 and a life insurance policy in the
amount of $1.0 million, the proceeds of which policy will be paid to beneficiaries designated by Mr. Sasser or to his estate. 

If the employment agreement is not renewed or if Mr. Sassers employment is terminated (a) due to his death or disability, (b) by Frontstep for cause (as defined in the employment agreement), or (c) by Mr. Sasser
more than one year after a change in control, Mr. Sasser will receive his base salary through the date of termination. He also will receive bonus compensation on a pro rata basis to the extent that Frontstep has achieved annual targets and
objectives as of the date of termination. If Mr. Sassers employment is terminated by Frontstep without cause or by Mr. Sasser within one year after a change in control: 



Mr. Sasser will receive the prorated base salary and bonus compensation previously described; 



Mr. Sasser will receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the amount of his annual base salary plus the highest bonus he earned under the employment
agreement in any fiscal year ended prior to the termination of his employment; 



if the severance payment results in additional tax to Mr. Sasser under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Sasser will receive an additional payment
so as to provide him with the benefits he would have received in the absence of such tax; and 



for a period ending on the earlier of the date Mr. Sasser is employed by another company or the second anniversary of the termination of his employment,
Frontstep will continue to maintain the long-term disability and life insurance policies previously described and provide Mr. Sasser and his family with benefits under the companys employee benefit plans at least equal to those they would have
received if Mr. Sassers employment had not been terminated. 

Severance and Other
Agreements with Certain Executive Officers.
    In September 2002, Frontstep entered into severance agreements with some of its executive officers, including Daniel P. Buettin (vice president, finance, chief financial officer
and secretary), Lawrence W. DeLeon (executive vice president, worldwide field operations), Aggie G. Haslup (vice president, marketing), Daryl L. Wartluft (executive vice president, products group), and Robert D. Williams (vice president, human
resources). Each severance agreement has a term that expires on August 31, 2004, but will be extended automatically for one additional year beginning on September 1, 2004 (and each following year) unless Frontstep provides notice of non-renewal by
March 31, 2004 or March 31 of each additional year. Even if Frontstep provides notice of non-renewal, if a change in control occurs during the term of the severance agreement, it will be extended for a period of six months beyond the expiration
of the term in effect immediately before the change in control occurred. The merger will constitute a change in control under each severance agreement. 

Following a change in control, if the executive officers employment is terminated during the term of the severance agreement due to his or her disability, by Frontstep for cause (as
defined in the severance agreements) or by the executive officer without good reason (as described below), the executive officer will receive an amount equal to his or her base salary and bonus at the rate then in effect earned through
the date of termination of employment.



If the executive officer dies following a change in control and during the term of the severance agreement, the executive officer will receive benefits determined in accordance with
Frontsteps retirement and insurance programs. If a change in control occurs or is announced during the term of the agreement and the executives employment is subsequently terminated by Frontstep without cause or by the executive for good
reason, the executive will receive the prorated base salary compensation previously described and severance benefits consisting of six months of the executives base salary and benefits in effect at the time of termination of employment,
payable in six equal monthly installments. Severance benefits will not be paid upon death or disability, and the executive cannot collect severance for voluntary termination unless it is for good reason. Under the severance agreements, good
reason includes the following: 



the assignment to the executive of duties substantially inconsistent with his or her status as an executive officer of Frontstep, the removal of the executive
from his or her position, or a substantial diminution in the nature or status of the executives responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control; 



a material reduction by Frontstep or any of its subsidiaries in the executives annual base salary or bonus plan as in effect on the date of any change in
control, unless consistent with a company wide pay and bonus adjustment; 



Frontsteps failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to Frontstep to assume and perform the severance agreement; or 



requiring the executive to have his or her principal location of work changed to any location that is in excess of 50 miles from the location of work
immediately prior to the change in control. 

The severance agreements obligate Frontstep to
require any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to expressly assume and agree to perform the severance agreements. MAPICS has agreed to cause Frontstep to honor and perform the severance agreements after the merger.

MAPICS has discussed the terms of possible employment with certain of the Frontstep executive officers. No
employment agreement has been executed as of the date of the joint proxy statement-prospectus. 

Consulting
AgreementLawrence J. Fox.
    MAPICS has agreed to enter into a consulting agreement with Lawrence J. Fox, a director and chairman of the Frontstep board of directors. The term of the consulting agreement will begin on
the effective date of the merger and will last for one year, unless it is terminated earlier by MAPICS or Mr. Fox. MAPICS may terminate the consulting agreement without cause upon 30 days written notice, or immediately without liability if Mr.
Fox breaches a material obligation under the consulting agreement and fails to remedy the breach within 15 days after being notified of the breach. Mr. Fox may terminate work under the consulting agreement without liability if MAPICS breaches a
material obligation under the consulting agreement and fails to remedy the breach within 30 days after being notified of the breach. 

Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Fox will assist in the integration of the businesses of Frontstep and MAPICS following the merger, be available for general consultation, assist in marketing conferences as requested
by MAPICS, and perform other reasonable duties as requested by the chief executive officer of MAPICS. Additionally, for a period of twelve months following the termination of the consulting agreement, Mr. Fox will not attempt to offer or sell
competitive products or services to any person to whom MAPICS has sold products or services during the twelve months prior to the termination of the consulting agreement. 
The consulting agreement also prohibits Mr. Fox from commencing
employment with, or otherwise providing services to, certain competitors of MAPICS without the prior written consent of MAPICS for a period of twelve months following the effective date of the consulting agreement. 

Mr. Foxs total compensation under the consulting agreement will be $450,000, payable in bi-weekly installments of $18,750 for a
period of twelve months. The consulting agreement also provides that the stock options granted by Frontstep to Mr. Fox on March 11, 1994 and August 23, 1994, respectively, and exchanged 



for MAPICS stock options will expire ten years after the grant date. Additionally, the consulting agreement provides that the stock option
granted by Frontstep to Mr. Fox on June 10, 2002, shall vest in full six months after the effective date of the consulting agreement, and that the expiration date of that stock option will be changed from June 10, 2012, to March 31, 2006. 
All
three stock options otherwise would have expired 90 days after the termination of Mr. Foxs employment with Frontstep. 

Subordinated Notes, Warrants and Conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Shares.
    Lawrence J. Fox holds 10% unsecured, subordinated notes due 2004 issued by Frontstep in the aggregate
principal amount of $1.5 million. The notes are convertible into Frontstep common shares at a rate of $2.349009 per share. MAPICS has agreed to pay Mr. Fox, at the effective time of the merger, the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but
unpaid interest, and Mr. Fox has agreed to surrender the notes to MAPICS for cancellation. In connection with the issuance of the notes, Frontstep issued a warrant to Mr. Fox to purchase 180,000 Frontstep common shares. Mr. Fox exercised the warrant
prior to the record date for the special meeting of Frontstep shareholders to vote on the merger agreement. The exercise of the warrant prior to the record date was a condition to MAPICS obligation to consummate the merger. 

James A. Rutherford, Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. and three entities affiliated with Morgan Stanley hold 10% unsecured,
subordinated notes due 2004 issued by Frontstep in the aggregate principal amounts of $350,000, $881,940 and $2.1 million, respectively. All of these notes are convertible into Frontstep common shares at a rate of $2.349009 per share. At the
effective time of the merger, the notes will be exchanged for new unsecured subordinated non-convertible notes issued by Frontstep and guaranteed by MAPICS, in the principal amount of the original notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest. The new
notes will be due and payable on February 28, 2004 and will bear interest at the rate of 10% per year from the effective time of the merger to August 31, 2003 and 12% per year after August 31, 2003 until paid. The new notes may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. In connection with Frontsteps issuance of the original notes, Frontstep issued warrants to each of Mr. Rutherford, Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. and the Morgan Stanley affiliates that hold the original notes to purchase,
respectively, 60,000, 105,833 and 254,167 Frontstep common shares. All of these warrants were exercised prior to the record date for the special meeting of Frontstep shareholders to vote on the merger agreement. The exercise of the warrants prior to
the record date was a condition to MAPICS obligation to consummate the merger. Mr. Rutherford is a director of Frontstep. Barry M. Goldsmith is a director of Frontstep and a member of Fallen Angel Capital, L.L.C., which is the general partner
of Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. Guy de Chazal is a director of Frontstep and a managing director of Morgan Stanley and of MSDW Venture Partners IV, Inc., an entity controlled by Morgan Stanley and the managing member of MSDW Venture Partners IV,
L.L.C., the general partner of each of the Morgan Stanley affiliate entities that hold the original notes issued by Frontstep. 

On November 24, 2002, Frontstep entered into a letter agreement with Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. and the entities affiliated with Morgan Stanley. At the time the letter agreement was executed, these entities held all of
the outstanding Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares. 

Under the terms of the letter agreement, the
holders of the Series A convertible preferred shares agreed to accept, at the effective time of the merger and in exchange for their Series A convertible preferred shares, a number of shares of MAPICS common stock equal to a 25% discount on the
Series A convertible preferred shares liquidation preference, based on the average closing price of MAPICS common stock during the period from November 7, 2002 through November 20, 2002, which we refer to as the average closing
price of MAPICS common stock. Additionally, under the letter agreement, each holder of the Series A convertible preferred shares agreed: 



to convert its Series A convertible preferred shares into Frontstep common shares prior to the record date set for the special meeting of Frontsteps
shareholders to vote on the merger agreement, which was a condition to MAPICS obligation to complete the merger; and 





to cancel, at the closing of the proposed merger, warrants to acquire 453,546 Frontstep common shares issued by Frontstep to the holders of the Series A
convertible preferred shares on May 10, 2000. 

Agreement with Updata Capital,
Inc.
    On February 25, 2002, Frontstep entered into an agreement with Updata under which Updata has provided various services to assist Frontstep in its evaluation of strategic and business alternatives, including the
merger. Under this agreement, Frontstep will reimburse Updata for all out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in connection with the agreement and will pay Updata a fee equal to $600,000 on the effective date of the merger. Frontstep also has agreed to
indemnify Updata and its officers, directors, agents, employees and controlling persons against any liability arising out of the services performed by Updata, except to the extent the liability results primarily from Updatas willful misconduct
or negligence. Updata is an affiliate of Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. Barry Goldsmith is a director of Frontstep and a managing director of Updata. Mr. Goldsmith also is a member of Fallen Angel Capital, which is the general partner of Fallen
Angel Equity Fund, L.P. 

Shareholder Agreements.
    All of the directors and
executive officers of Frontstep, Fallen Angel Equity Fund, L.P. and the Morgan Stanley affiliated entities that held Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares have entered into agreements to vote their Frontstep common shares in favor of the
merger. Pursuant to these shareholder agreements, shareholders expected to hold approximately 60.90% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares as of the record date have committed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. See The
MergerShareholder Agreements for a more detailed discussion of these shareholder agreements. 

Legal Fees.
    Duke W. Thomas, a director of Frontstep, is a partner in Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease LLP, which has served as Frontsteps outside legal counsel in connection with numerous matters,
including the merger. The law firm has received and expects to receive customary fees for the services performed. 

Indemnification and Release.
    For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, Frontstep will indemnify the former directors, employees and agents of Frontstep against all liabilities
arising out of their service to Frontstep to the fullest extent permitted by Frontsteps charter and code of regulations as in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed. Subject to limitations, MAPICS also has agreed to cause Frontstep
after the merger to maintain for six years directors and officers liability insurance coverage substantially equivalent to levels of coverage currently in effect under Frontsteps existing directors and officers
liability insurance. 

Stock Options.
    All options to purchase Frontstep
common shares granted under Frontsteps stock option plans, including options held by executive officers and certain employee directors of Frontstep, will be converted into options to acquire shares of MAPICS common stock. Prior to execution of
the merger agreement, all options issued under the Amended and Restated Frontstep, Inc. Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors were cancelled. See The MergerEffect of the Merger on Frontstep Options for a more detailed discussion
of the treatment of Frontsteps options under the merger agreement. 

Employee Benefits and
Contracts.
    The merger agreement requires MAPICS to provide Frontstep employees with employee benefits under employee benefit and welfare plans (other than stock option or other plans that may require MAPICS to issue
shares of its common stock) which, when taken as a whole, are substantially similar to those currently provided by MAPICS to its similarly situated employees. However, the merger agreement provides that, for a period of twelve months following the
effective time of the merger, MAPICS has the option of providing Frontstep employees with severance benefits in accordance with the current policies of either Frontstep or MAPICS. For purposes of participation, vesting and, except with respect to
MAPICS retirement plans, benefit accrual under MAPICS employee benefit plans, Frontstep employees will receive credit under employee benefit plans for their past service with Frontstep. MAPICS will also honor all



employment and severance, consulting or other compensation agreements disclosed to MAPICS and all vested benefits or other vested amounts accrued through the effective time of the merger under
Frontsteps employee benefit plans. 

Resales of MAPICS Common Stock 

The shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of MAPICS common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of either MAPICS or
Frontstep at the time of the shareholder meetings. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of either MAPICS or Frontstep, and may include their
respective executive officers and directors, as well as their significant shareholders. Affiliates may not sell shares of MAPICS common stock they acquire in connection with the merger except pursuant to: 



an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares; 



an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or 



any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

MAPICS registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement-prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of MAPICS common stock to
be received by affiliates of Frontstep in the merger. 

Rights of Dissenting Shareholders 

The holders of Frontstep common shares will have
dissenters rights in connection with the merger. The following summary is a description of the steps you must take if you desire to perfect your dissenters rights. The summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code, a copy of which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Frontstep recommends that you consult with your own counsel if you have questions with respect to
your dissenters rights under Section 1701.85. 

Dissenters rights are your right to dissent
from the merger and to have the fair cash value of your Frontstep common shares determined by a court and paid in cash. The fair cash value of a Frontstep common share is the amount that a willing seller who is under no
compulsion to sell would be willing to accept and that a willing buyer who is under no compulsion to purchase would be willing to pay. The fair cash value is determined as of the day prior to the day on which the vote of the shareholders to adopt
the merger agreement and approve the merger is taken. When determining fair cash value, any appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from the proposed merger is excluded. In no event will the fair cash value of a Frontstep common share
exceed the amount specified in the demand of the particular shareholder, as discussed below. Frontstep sometimes refers to the Frontstep common shares as to which dissenters rights are exercised as the dissenting shares.

To perfect your dissenters rights, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: 



you must be the record holder of the dissenting shares on the record date for the Frontstep special meeting; if you have a beneficial interest in Frontstep
common shares held of record in the name of any other person for which you desire to perfect dissenters rights, you must cause the shareholder of record to timely and properly act to perfect such rights; 



you must not vote your Frontstep common shares in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; you will waive your dissenters
rights if you vote your Frontstep common



shares for adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; a failure to vote or abstaining from voting will satisfy this requirement, but a vote in favor of the merger, by proxy or
in person, or the return of a signed proxy that does not specify an abstention or a vote against adoption of the merger agreement, will constitute a vote in favor of the merger agreement, a waiver of your dissenters rights and will nullify any
previously filed written demand for the fair cash value of your Frontstep common shares; 



on or before the tenth day following the Frontstep shareholders vote adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger, you must serve a written
demand on Frontstep for the fair cash value of your dissenting shares; the written demand must specify your name and address, the number of Frontstep common shares as to which relief is sought and the amount that you claim as the fair cash value of
the Frontstep common shares for which you are exercising dissenters rights; 



if requested by Frontstep, you must submit to Frontstep your certificate(s) for the dissenting shares within 15 days after your receipt of
Frontsteps request; Frontstep will then endorse the certificate(s) with a legend that demand for fair cash value has been made; and 



if you and Frontstep cannot agree on the fair cash value of your dissenting shares, either you or Frontstep must, within three months after service of
your written demand, file or join in a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio, for a determination of the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. 

If you dissent from the merger, your right to be paid the fair cash value of your Frontstep common shares will terminate if: 



for any reason, the merger is not completed; 



you fail to serve a timely and appropriate written demand upon Frontstep; 



you do not, upon request of Frontstep, make timely and appropriate surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing your dissenting shares for endorsement of a legend
that demand for the fair cash value of such common shares has been made; 



you withdraw your demand with the consent of the directors of Frontstep; 



you and Frontstep have not agreed upon the fair cash value of your dissenting shares and neither you nor Frontstep have timely filed or joined in an appropriate
petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio; or 



you otherwise fail to comply with the requirements of Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code. 

All written demands for the fair cash value of your Frontstep common shares should be addressed to Frontstep, Inc., 2800 Corporate
Exchange Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43231, Attention: Daniel P. Buettin, Chief Financial Officer. The written demand must be executed by or for the record holder of the dissenting shares, fully and correctly, as the holders name appears on the
certificate(s) for the shares. 

Shareholder Agreements 

The following summary of the Frontstep shareholder agreements
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the shareholder agreement, which is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement-prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. 

In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, certain Frontstep shareholders and all of its executive officers and directors entered into a
shareholder agreement with MAPICS and Frontstep under which these shareholders agreed to vote all their Frontstep common shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. These shareholders also agreed to vote all their Frontstep common
shares against the approval of any



transaction made in opposition to, or in competition with, the merger. As of January 14, 2003, the record date for the Frontstep special meeting, these shareholders owned Frontstep common
shares representing approximately 60.90% of the outstanding Frontstep common shares. 

Each shareholder
agreement prohibits, subject to limited exceptions, the shareholder from transferring or making an arrangement to transfer any Frontstep common shares except to a person who agrees to be bound by the terms of the shareholder agreement. It also
provides that Frontstep common shares that are subsequently acquired by the shareholder will also be subject to the shareholder agreement. The shareholder agreement also prohibits, subject to enumerated exceptions, the direct or indirect transfer of
MAPICS common stock received in the merger for a period of 180 days following the completion of the merger. 

Shareholders have agreed in the shareholder agreement to release Frontstep and its affiliates from claims (other than rights to reimbursement of expenses, indemnification, the provision of directors and officers insurance to
which the shareholder may be entitled pursuant to the merger agreement, and certain rights to payment of amounts associated with a shareholders employment by Frontstep) such shareholder has or may have related to acts relating to the merger or
other events occurring or circumstances existing at or prior to the completion of the merger. 

The former holders
of Frontstep Series A convertible preferred shares and Mr. Fox have agreed that, for a two-year period following the completion of the merger, those shareholders will not: 

(1)

in any way effect, seek or otherwise propose or assist any other person in effecting, seeking or otherwise proposing: 



any acquisition of securities or assets of MAPICS or any of its subsidiaries, other than acquisitions of MAPICS common stock equal to or less than 5% of the
shares of MAPICS common stock issued to the shareholder in the merger; 



any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination or any recapitalization, restructuring liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary
transaction with respect to or involving MAPICS or any of its subsidiaries; 



any solicitation of proxies or consents to vote any voting securities of MAPICS; or 



any action which might force MAPICS to make a public announcement regarding any of the foregoing; 

(2)

form, join or in any way participate in a group, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, other than a group that may be deemed to be
formed by the shareholder agreement; 

(3)

act alone or in concert with others to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors, or policies of MAPICS; or 

(4)

enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. 

All shareholder agreements terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, unless: 



Frontstep shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement or approve the merger at the Frontstep special meeting; 



any person, other than MAPICS or a subsidiary of MAPICS, shall have made, re-affirmed or publicly disclosed an intention to make or re-affirm an acquisition
proposal as defined in the shareholder agreement; or 



any person shall have formerly protested any application filed with specified regulatory authorities; 



in which case certain provisions of the shareholder agreement, including the agreement to vote against
the approval of an opposing transaction, will survive for a period of nine months following such termination. 

Effect of the Merger on Rights of Shareholders 

MAPICS is organized under the laws of
the State of Georgia. Frontstep is organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. Differences in the rights of holders of MAPICS capital stock and Frontstep capital stock arise from both differences in the laws under which they are organized and
differences in their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws or code of regulations. Upon completion of the merger, holders of Frontstep common shares will become holders of MAPICS common stock and their rights will be governed by Georgia
law, the MAPICS articles of incorporation and the MAPICS bylaws. The rights of MAPICS shareholders after completion of the merger will not differ from their rights as they previously existed. 

This section of the joint proxy statement-prospectus describes the material differences between the rights of MAPICS shareholders and Frontstep shareholders. All
Frontstep shareholders in particular are urged to read carefully the relevant provisions of Georgia and Ohio law, as well as the articles of incorporation and bylaws or code of regulations of each of MAPICS and Frontstep. Copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of MAPICS and the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Frontstep, as amended, will be sent to shareholders upon request. See Where You Can Find More Information. 

Capitalization 

MAPICS.
    The authorized capital stock of MAPICS consists of: 



90,000,000 shares of common stock; and 



1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 

Frontstep.
    The authorized capital stock of Frontstep consists of: 



20,000,000 common shares; and 



1,000,000 preferred shares. 

Voting Rights 

MAPICS.
    Under Georgia law, unless the
articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders meeting. MAPICS articles of incorporation provide that holders of its Series D
and Series E convertible preferred stock generally shall vote with the common stock together as a single class, on an as converted basis. Although subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, each share of Series D and Series E convertible
preferred stock is currently convertible into ten shares of MAPICS common stock. Each holder of MAPICS common stock has the right to cast one vote for each share of MAPICS common stock held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders of MAPICS, including the election of directors. Holders of MAPICS common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. 

Frontstep.
    Under Ohio law, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, entitles the shareholder to one vote on each matter properly submitted to
shareholders of the corporation for their vote. Frontsteps amended articles of incorporation expressly provide that each holder of Frontstep common shares has the right to cast one vote for each Frontstep common share held at the close of
business on the record date on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Frontstep, including the election of directors. Holders of Frontstep common shares do not have cumulative voting rights.



Number and Election of Directors 

MAPICS.
    The MAPICS board of directors currently has six members. The MAPICS articles of incorporation provide that the number of directors of
MAPICS will not be less than three nor more than eleven, with the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time by the MAPICS board of directors. 

The MAPICS board of directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with one class being elected each year at the annual meeting of the shareholders. Members of the MAPICS
board of directors are elected to serve a term of three years, until their successors are elected and qualified. The MAPICS articles of incorporation and bylaws provide for directors to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by MAPICS
shareholders entitled to vote in the election of directors. 

Frontstep.
    The
Frontstep board of directors currently has eight members. Frontsteps amended code of regulations provides that the number of directors may be fixed or changed: 



at a meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors at which a quorum is present, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of not
less than a majority of the voting shares which are represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal; or 



by the directors, provided, however, that the directors may not increase the number of directors to more than ten nor reduce the number of directors to less
than three. 

Frontsteps amended code of regulations provides that at each annual meeting
of shareholders for the election of directors, the successors to the directors whose terms expire in that year are to be elected. Under Ohio law, only persons nominated as candidates are eligible for election as directors and, at all elections of
directors, the candidates receiving the greatest number of votes are elected. 

Removal of Directors and
Vacancies on the Board of Directors 

MAPICS.
    Pursuant to the MAPICS bylaws and
Georgia law, the entire board of directors or any individual director may be removed from office, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote,
together as a single class on an as converted basis, in the election of such director or directors. MAPICS bylaws define cause to include conviction of a felony, declaration of unsound mind by order of a court, gross dereliction of duty,
knowing violation of the law or the commission of an action involving either moral turpitude or an improper substantial personal benefit and resulting in a material injury to the corporation. The removal of a director may occur at any properly
called shareholders meeting if notice of such purpose has been given. Any vacancy on the board of directors resulting from the removal of a director by shareholder action may be filled by the shareholders at their annual meeting or at a
special meeting, so long as notice of such action was provided in the notice of the meeting. Vacancies on the board that arise for any other reason generally may be filled only by the remaining directors. 

Frontstep.
    Pursuant to the Frontstep amended code of regulations and Ohio law, Frontstep shareholders may
remove a director or directors from office, with or without assigning any cause, only by the vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise not less than a majority of the voting power of the corporation to elect directors in place of
those removed. In case of any such removal, a new director may be elected at the same meeting for the unexpired term of each director removed. If the shareholders do not fill the vacancy created by such removal, the remaining directors, though less
than a majority of the whole authorized number of directors, may, by the vote of a majority of their number, fill any vacancy in the board for the unexpired term. 

Shareholder Preemptive Rights 

MAPICS.
    Georgia law provides that the shareholders of a Georgia corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporations unissued shares, except to the extent the articles of
incorporation permit. The MAPICS articles of incorporation do not provide any preemptive rights for MAPICS shareholders. 



Frontstep.    
Ohio law provides that the shareholders
of an Ohio corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporations unissued shares, except to the extent the articles of incorporation permit. Frontsteps articles of incorporation expressly eliminate any preemptive rights
of shareholders. 

Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation 

MAPICS.
    Under Georgia law, the MAPICS board of directors may, except with regard to certain specified
amendments that do not require shareholder approval, propose one or more amendments to the articles of incorporation for submission to the shareholders. For the amendment to be adopted, the board of directors must recommend the amendment to the
shareholders unless the board of directors elects, because of a conflict of interest or other circumstances, to make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its election to the shareholders with the amendment. The shareholders entitled to
vote on the amendment must approve the amendment by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote on the amendment. The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed amendment on
any basis. 

Frontstep.
    Under Ohio law, the vote of holders of shares entitling them
to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation is required to adopt an amendment to the Frontstep amended articles of incorporation, unless the articles provide for a different proportion which cannot be less than a majority.
Frontsteps amended articles of incorporation do not alter the two-thirds voting requirement for amending its articles. 

Amendments to the Bylaws/Code of Regulations 

MAPICS.
    The
MAPICS bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, and new bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of MAPICS stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class on an as converted basis. The board of directors also may amend the bylaws of the corporation by a majority vote. The shareholders may prohibit the board of directors from amending and repealing a bylaw
previously adopted or amended by the shareholders by stating such prohibition in the shareholders action adopting such bylaw. 

Frontstep.
    The amended code of regulations of Frontstep may be amended, or new regulations may be adopted, at a meeting of shareholders held for such purpose, by the affirmative vote of the
holders of shares entitling them to exercise not less than a majority of the voting power of the corporation on such proposal, or without a meeting by the written consent of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise not less than a majority
of the voting power of the corporation on such proposal. 

Action by Written Consent 

MAPICS.
    Under Georgia law and the MAPICS articles of incorporation, shareholders may take any
action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholders meeting without such a meeting if the action is taken by unanimous written consent. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by
all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. 

Frontstep.
    Under Ohio Law, any action that may be taken by shareholders of an Ohio corporation at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting with the
unanimous written consent of all shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. The amended code of regulations of Frontstep contains a parallel provision which provides that any action which may be authorized or taken at a meeting of the
shareholders may be authorized or taken without a meeting with the affirmative vote or approval of, and in a writing or writings signed by, all the shareholders who would be entitled to notice of a meeting of the shareholders held for such purposes
(except for actions in writing to amend the code of regulations which require the consent of holders of shares entitled to exercise not less than a majority of the voting
 power of Frontstep). 



Ability to Call Special Shareholder Meeting 

MAPICS.
    MAPICS bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time by the
board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the president or the holders of not less than 40% of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at such special meeting following delivery by such holders to the
corporations secretary of a signed and dated written request setting forth the purpose or purposes of such special meeting. 

Frontstep.
    Ohio law provides that holders of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of an Ohio corporation (unless the code of regulations of the corporation specifies another percentage, which may in no
case be greater than 50%) and entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, the directors of the corporation by action at a meeting or a majority of the directors acting without a meeting, the chairman of the board of the corporation, and the
president of the corporation (or, in case of the presidents death or disability, the vice president of the corporation authorized to exercise the authority of the president) have the authority to call special meetings of shareholders.

Frontsteps amended code of regulations expressly provides that special meetings may be called by the
chairman of the board, the president (or in case of the presidents absence, death, or disability, the vice president authorized to exercise the authority of the president), the secretary, the directors by action at a meeting, or a majority of
the directors acting without a meeting, or the holders of at least a majority of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders. 

Notice of Shareholders Meeting 

MAPICS.
    MAPICS bylaws provide that, unless waived, a notice of each meeting of the shareholders stating the date, time and place of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at that meeting. In the case of an annual meeting, the notice need not state the purpose or purposes of the meeting unless the articles of incorporation or Georgia law requires
otherwise. In the case of a special meeting, including a special meeting in lieu of an annual meeting, the notice of the meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. 

Frontstep.
    Ohio law requires an Ohio corporation to notify shareholders of the corporation of the time,
place and purposes of shareholder meetings at least seven days but no more than 60 days prior to the date of the shareholders meeting, unless the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of the corporation specify a longer period.
Frontsteps amended code of regulations has altered this statutory provision to provide that Frontstep notify shareholders at least seven days but no more than 90 days prior to the date of the shareholders meeting. 

Ohio law requires an Ohio corporation, upon request of an individual entitled to call a special shareholders meeting, to give shareholders
notice of the special meeting to be held no less than seven nor more than 60 days after receipt of the request, unless the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of the corporation specify a longer period. Frontsteps amended code of
regulations has altered this statutory provision to provide that the corporation notify shareholders at least seven days but no more than 120 days after receipt of such request. Under the Frontstep amended code of regulations, if notice is not given
within 90 days of receipt of the request, the individual calling the meeting may fix the time for the meeting and give notice to the other shareholders. 

Elimination of Certain Liabilities of Directors 

MAPICS
.    Georgia law permits a corporations articles of incorporation to include a provision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary
damages for breach of duty of care or other duty as a director, except that such a provision may not eliminate liability for 



any appropriation, in violation of such directors duties, of any business opportunity of the corporation; 



any acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 





authorizing an unlawful distribution; or 



any transaction from which the director received an improper personal benefit. MAPICS articles of incorporation include such provisions. 

Frontstep
.    
Under Ohio law, directors of an Ohio corporation are not
generally liable for monetary damages, unless it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that the directors action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause
injury to the corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors of an Ohio corporation are jointly and severally liable if they vote for or assent to any unlawful
loans, dividends or distributions of assets. 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

MAPICS.
    Georgia law provides that a Georgia corporation may indemnify directors, officers,
employees and agents of a corporation within prescribed limits, and must indemnify them under certain circumstances. 

MAPICS bylaws provide that the corporation will indemnify any of its directors or officers who is a party in proceedings because he or she is or was an officer or director of MAPICS against liability incurred in the proceeding
if such individual conducted himself or herself in good faith and reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity, that such conduct was in the best interest of MAPICS. In all other cases, the individual must have
reasonably believed that such conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of MAPICS. In the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual must have had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. MAPICS may not
indemnify a director or officer in connection with a proceeding (a) by or in the right of the company except for reasonable expenses if it is determined that the director or officer has met the relevant standard of conduct, or (b) with respect to
conduct for which he or she was adjudged liable on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received. 

MAPICS may not indemnify a director or officer unless a determination has been made for the specific proceeding that indemnification of the director or officer is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met the
relevant standard of conduct. However, regardless of the result or absence of any such determination, MAPICS must indemnify a director or officer who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or
she was a party because he or she was a director or officer of MAPICS against reasonable expenses incurred by the director or officer in connection with the proceeding. MAPICS is authorized to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its
directors and officers. 

In addition, MAPICS must pay expenses incurred by its directors and officers in defending
a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding because they are directors or officers in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding. The payment of expenses will be made only if MAPICS receives (a) a written affirmation of
the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the relevant standard of conduct or that the proceeding involves conduct for which such persons liability has been eliminated under the articles of incorporation
and (b) an undertaking by or on behalf of a director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by MAPICS, as authorized by MAPICS articles of
incorporation and bylaws. 

Frontstep.
    Ohio law provides that an Ohio corporation may
indemnify directors, officers, employees and agents of a corporation within prescribed limits, and must indemnify them under certain circumstances. 

The Frontstep amended code of regulations provides that Frontstep will indemnify its directors or officers against expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, filing fees, court
reporters fees and transcript costs) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement by reason of the fact that they are or were directors, officers, employees or agents of Frontstep or, at the request of Frontstep, were serving another entity
in a similar



capacity. In order to receive indemnification, a Frontstep director or officer must have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of Frontstep, and, with regard to criminal matters, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Under the Frontstep amended code of regulations, a Frontstep director or officer claiming indemnification
will be presumed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Frontstep and, with respect to any criminal matter, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful. 

Under Frontsteps amended code of regulations, Frontstep may not indemnify
any officer or director of Frontstep who was a party to any completed action or suit instituted by, or in the right of, Frontstep for any claim, issue or matter asserted in the action as to which the officer or director has been adjudged to be
liable for acting with reckless disregard for the best interests of Frontstep or misconduct, other than negligence, in the performance of his or her duty to Frontstep. If, however, the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio or the court in
which the action was brought determines that the officer or director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity, Frontstep must indemnify the officer or director to the extent permitted by the court. 

Frontstep may make any indemnification not precluded by Frontsteps amended code of regulations only upon a determination that the
director or officer has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination may be made only: 



by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors; 



if a quorum is not obtainable or if a majority of a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, in a written opinion by independent legal counsel;



by the Frontstep shareholders; or 



by the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio or the court, if any, in which the action was brought. 

Frontstep must pay expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, filing fees, court reporters fees and transcript
costs) incurred by its directors and officers in defending any action, suit or proceeding because they are directors or officers of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding to or on behalf of the
directors or officers promptly as such expenses are incurred by them. However, the payment of such expenses will only be made by Frontstep if a director or officer first agrees, in writing, to repay all amounts so paid in respect of any claim, issue
or other matter asserted if: 



it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by Frontstep, as provided under the Frontstep amended articles of
incorporation and amended code of regulations; or 



the director or officer is found liable for acting with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation or misconduct (other than negligence) in
the performance of his duties to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio or the court in which the action, suit or proceeding was brought determines that despite such adjudication of
liability, the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to such indemnification. 

The amended code of regulations of Frontstep states that the indemnification provided by the regulations is not exclusive of any other right to which any individual seeking indemnification may be entitled. Additionally, the Frontstep
amended code of regulations provides that Frontstep may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Frontstep, or who is or was serving another entity at the request of
Frontstep, against any liability asserted against the individual and incurred by the individual in that capacity, or arising out of the individuals status as such, whether or not Frontstep would have the obligation or power to indemnify the
individual under the Frontstep amended code of regulations. 

State Anti-Takeover Statutes 

MAPICS.
    As permitted under Georgia law, MAPICS bylaws prohibit MAPICS from entering into
some business combination transactions with interested shareholders for a period of five years from the date the



person becomes an interested shareholder, unless specific requirements are satisfied. Generally, an interested shareholder is any person that owns at least 10% of outstanding MAPICS voting stock,
but not including MAPICS or its subsidiaries. As permitted under Georgia law, MAPICS bylaws also require that specified business combination transactions meet specific fair price criteria and other tests, or meet specific requirements relating
to approval of the transaction by the MAPICS board of directors and shareholders. 

Frontstep.
    Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code prohibits an interested shareholder from engaging in a wide range of business combinations (such as mergers and significant asset sales) with
an issuing public corporation for three years after the date on which a shareholder becomes an interested shareholder (share acquisition date), unless the directors of the corporation approved the transaction or the share
purchase by the interested shareholder prior to the share acquisition date. If the transaction was not previously approved, the interested shareholder may effect a transaction after the three-year period only if the transaction is approved by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the disinterested shares or if the offer meets certain fair price criteria. 

Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code restrictions do not apply if an Ohio corporation, by action of its shareholders holding at least
two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation, adopts an amendment to its articles of incorporation specifying that Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code will not be applicable to the corporation. Frontsteps amended articles of
incorporation expressly provide that the provisions of Chapter 1704 will not apply. 

Under Section 1701.831 of the
Ohio Revised Code or the Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act, unless the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of an Ohio corporation otherwise provide, any control share acquisition of an issuing public corporation can only be
made with the prior approval of the shareholders of the corporation. Frontsteps amended articles of incorporation expressly provide that the provisions of Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code will not apply to control share acquisitions
of the corporation. 

Constituency Considerations 

MAPICS
.    Georgia law permits a corporations articles of incorporation to provide that, in discharging the duties of their respective
positions and in determining what is believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, the board of directors, any committee thereof and any individual director, in addition to considering the effects of any action on the corporation or its
shareholders, may consider the interests of its employees, customers and suppliers, the creditors of the corporation and its subsidiaries, the communities in which offices or other establishments of the corporation and its subsidiaries are located,
and all other factors such directors consider pertinent. MAPICS articles of incorporation include such a provision. 

Frontstep
.    
Under Ohio law, the directors of a corporation, in determining what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation, must consider the interests of the
corporations shareholders and, in the directors discretion, may consider the interests of the corporations employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state and nation, community and societal considerations,
and the long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. 

Effect of Preferred Stock 

MAPICS.
    Holders of the MAPICS Series D convertible preferred stock and the Series E convertible preferred stock are generally entitled to vote on an as converted
basis with the holders of MAPICS common stock together as a single class, currently at a ratio of ten votes per share of preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis, together with the holders of common stock,
are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors from legally available funds. The holders of shares of MAPICS common stock are entitled to receive pro rata all assets of MAPICS available for distribution
to those holders upon liquidation 
only
 after payment of a liquidation preference to the preferred shareholders in an amount equal to the greater of $75.36 per share of preferred stock plus an amount per share of



preferred stock equal to any dividends declared but unpaid on the convertible preferred stock or such amount the holder would have received had it converted to common stock immediately prior to
the distribution. The holders of the MAPICS Series D convertible preferred stock and the Series E convertible preferred stock can at any time convert their shares of convertible preferred stock into a number of shares of MAPICS common stock equal to
$100 per share divided by the then applicable conversion price, which is currently $10.00 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustment based on the occurrence of certain events, such as upon a stock split or stock dividend. Generally,
the effect of this adjustment is to protect the holders of the MAPICS preferred stock from dilution of their interests upon reclassification or other modification of the MAPICS common stock. The articles of incorporation authorize the board of
directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix, with respect to any such series of preferred stock, the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and
terms, liquidation preferences, sinking funds and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of preferred stock issued. 

Frontstep.
    There are no Frontstep preferred shares currently outstanding. 

Rights Agreement 

MAPICS.
    MAPICS has adopted a shareholder rights plan under which MAPICS has distributed to all of its existing shareholders rights to purchase shares of MAPICS Series F junior participating
preferred stock. If specific triggering events occur, the holders of the rights will be able to purchase shares of MAPICS common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of MAPICS common stock. The
shareholders rights plan could increase a potential acquirers cost of effecting a merger with MAPICS or a tender offer for MAPICS outstanding securities that is not approved by the MAPICS board of directors. These increased costs could
prevent or discourage a transaction, even though MAPICS shareholders might want to vote in favor of the merger or participate in the tender offer. Frontstep shareholders receiving shares of MAPICS common stock in the merger also will be entitled to
such rights.

Frontstep.
    Frontstep does not have a rights plan or comparable
arrangement in place.

On November 22, 2002, the last trading day prior to public announcement of the
merger, the last sale price of MAPICS common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market was $6.80 per share and the last sale price of Frontstep common shares as reported on the Nasdaq National Market was $1.94 per share. 

MAPICS has never paid or declared any cash dividends on shares of its common or Series D or E convertible preferred stock.
MAPICS policy is to retain all net earnings for the development of its business, and it does not anticipate paying cash dividends on the MAPICS common or convertible preferred stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash
dividends will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon MAPICS profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. The payment of
cash dividends may be limited by covenants within the credit facility MAPICS intends to secure in connection with the merger. 



PROPOSAL 2:    ELECTION OF MAPICS DIRECTORS 

Nominees 

Pursuant to MAPICS articles of incorporation and bylaws, MAPICS
board of directors must consist of at least three and no more than eleven persons, with the precise number to be determined by resolution of MAPICS shareholders or the board of directors from time to time. The MAPICS board is now comprised of
six directors and is divided into three classes of two directors each. The MAPICS shareholders elect the directors in each class for a term of three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. The term of office of one class of
directors expires each year at the annual meeting, and the shareholders elect a new class of directors each year at that time. 

At the MAPICS annual meeting, the terms of the two Class III directors, Terry H. Osborne and H. Mitchell Watson, Jr., will expire. The MAPICS board of directors has nominated Mr. Osborne and Mr. Watson for re-election at the annual
meeting. If re-elected, Mr. Osborne and Mr. Watson will each serve a three-year term that will expire at the 2006 annual meeting. If Mr. Osborne or Mr. Watson should be unavailable to serve for any reason, which is not anticipated, the MAPICS board
of directors may: 



designate a substitute nominee, in which case the persons named as proxies will vote the shares represented by all valid proxies for the election of such
substitute nominee; 



allow the vacancy to remain open until a suitable candidate is located and nominated; or 



adopt a resolution to decrease the authorized number of directors. 

The MAPICS board of directors unanimously recommends that the MAPICS shareholders vote FOR the proposal to re-elect Terry H. Osborne and H. Mitchell Watson
as Class III directors for a three-year term expiring at the 2006 annual meeting and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. 

Information Regarding Nominees and Continuing Directors 

Listed below are the names of
the MAPICS boards two nominees for re-election and each of the four incumbent directors whose term of office will continue after the annual meeting, together in each case with his or her age as of December 1, 2002, his or her business

PROPOSAL 3:    AMENDMENT OF THE MAPICS 1998 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 

TO INCREASE THE AVAILABLE SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK 

MAPICS currently maintains the MAPICS Amended and Restated 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under
which stock options and other incentive awards may be granted to MAPICS employees, officers, consultants and directors. As of January 3, 2003, there were 421,964 shares remaining available for awards under the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. On December 6, 2002, the MAPICS board of directors recommended that the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan be amended, subject to the approval of the shareholders, to: 



increase the number of shares of MAPICS common stock available for awards from 4,500,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares; 



limit the number of all full value awards, such as performance units and stock awards, to 20% of the common stock available; 



require shareholder approval as a condition to any direct or indirect repricing of stock options, such as through an exchange offer; 



require shareholder approval for material plan amendments; and 



reaffirm the performance goals on which performance awards may be based under Section 13.13 of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

A summary of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as proposed to be amended, is set forth below. The
summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. MAPICS will provide a copy of the full text of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan to any current MAPICS shareholder upon request and without
charge. Requests should be sent to MAPICS, Inc., 1000 Windward Concourse Parkway, Suite 100, Alpharetta, Georgia 30005, Attention: Martin D. Avallone, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. 

The MAPICS board of directors unanimously recommends that MAPICS shareholders vote FOR the proposal to amend the
MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Approval of Proposal 3 is contingent upon MAPICS shareholders approval of Proposal 1. 

General 

The purpose of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan is to promote the
success and enhance the value of MAPICS stock by linking the personal interests of employees, officers, consultants and directors to those of the shareholders and by providing these persons with an incentive for outstanding performance. As of
January 3, 2003, approximately 455 persons were eligible to participate in the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

In connection with the completion of the merger, the number of MAPICS employees will increase substantially. Frontsteps employee options will vest upon the merger, and, based on the exchange ratio, most, if not all, of
these options will be out of the money. In order to align the interests of employees with the interests of the shareholders and to motivate and retain key employees, including the employees of Frontstep, the MAPICS board of directors believes that
additional availability of shares under the 1998 MAPICS Long-Term Incentive Plan is desirable. Excluding shares issued for extraordinary purposes such as awards issued in connection with a subsequent acquisition, MAPICS management anticipates
that this additional availability of shares will meet its requirements through its fiscal year ending September 30, 2005. 

The MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of awards to MAPICS employees, officers, consultants and directors and those of MAPICS affiliated companies in the following forms: 



options to purchase shares of MAPICS common stock, which may be incentive stock options or  non-qualified stock options; 



stock appreciation rights, or SARs; 



performance units; 



restricted stock; 



dividend equivalents; and 



other stock-based awards. 



Pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, MAPICS may not deduct
compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and the four next most highly compensated executive officers. The MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan is designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code so
that the grant of options, SARs and other awards under the plan that are conditioned on performance goals will be excluded from the calculation of annual compensation and will be fully deductible by MAPICS. 

Number of Shares 

The aggregate number of shares of MAPICS common stock currently
reserved and available for awards or which may be used to determine the value of an award (such as with a SAR or performance unit) is 4,500,000, of which no more than 20% may be granted in the form of restricted or unrestricted stock awards. MAPICS
proposes to increase the aggregate number of shares available for awards under the plan to 6,000,000, of which no more than 20% would be granted in the form of full value awards such as restricted or unrestricted stock awards or
performance units. No participant may receive options or SARs for more than 300,000 shares during any one calendar year. In addition, the maximum fair market value of all awards, other than options and SARs, that a participant may receive during any
one calendar year (less any consideration paid by the participant) is $2,000,000. 

Administration 

The MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan is administered by
MAPICS compensation committee. The compensation committee has the authority and discretion to designate participants and to determine the type of awards to be granted to each participant and the terms and conditions of the award. In addition,
the compensation committee may establish, adopt or revise any rules and regulations necessary or advisable to administer the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

Awards 

Stock Options.
    The MAPICS compensation committee
is authorized to grant options to participants, which may be incentive stock options, referred to as ISOs, or non-qualified stock options, referred to as NSOs. All options are evidenced by a written award agreement or certificate between MAPICS and
the participant, which includes an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying MAPICS common stock as of the date of grant. In addition, the terms of any ISO must meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The compensation committee may provide in an award agreement for the automatic grant of additional options to the participant equal to the number of shares of MAPICS common stock surrendered in payment of the exercise price of the
original option. The exercise price for the new option would be equal to the fair market value of the surrendered MAPICS common stock on the date of exercise of the original option, and the term of the new option would be co-extensive with the term
of the original option. During fiscal 2002, MAPICS did not grant any options with this provision. 

Stock Appreciation Rights.
    The MAPICS compensation committee may grant SARs to participants. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the participant has the right to receive the excess of the fair market value of
one share of MAPICS common stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR as determined by the compensation committee. The grant price of the SAR may not be less than the fair market value of one share of MAPICS common stock on the
date of grant. All awards of SARs are evidenced by an award agreement, reflecting the terms, methods of exercise, methods of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, and any other terms and conditions of the SAR. During fiscal 2002,
MAPICS did not grant any SARs. 

Performance Units.
    The MAPICS compensation committee
may grant performance units to participants on the terms and conditions established by the compensation committee. The compensation committee has the complete discretion to determine the number of performance units granted to each participant and to
set performance goals and other conditions that may determine the number and value of performance units paid to the participant. During fiscal 2002, MAPICS did not grant any performance units. 

Restricted Stock Awards.
    The MAPICS compensation committee may make awards of restricted stock, which are subject to restrictions on
transferability and other restrictions as the compensation committee may



impose. These restrictions may include limitations on the right to vote restricted stock or the right to receive dividends on the restricted stock. Any awards of restricted stock that exceed 10%
of the total MAPICS common stock authorized under the plan will be subject to minimum vesting provisions: one year from the date of grant if vesting is based on the grantee meeting performance criteria, or three years from the date of grant if
vesting is not related to performance. MAPICS granted 3,610 shares in the form of restricted stock awards during fiscal 2002. 

Dividend Equivalents.
    The MAPICS compensation committee is authorized to grant dividend equivalents to participants subject to terms and conditions established by the compensation committee. Dividend
equivalents entitle the participant to receive payments equal to dividends with respect to all or a portion of the number of shares of MAPICS common stock subject to an award, as determined by the compensation committee. The compensation committee
may provide that dividend equivalents are to be paid or distributed when accrued or be deemed to have been reinvested in additional shares of MAPICS common stock or otherwise reinvested. During fiscal 2002, MAPICS did not grant any dividend
equivalents. 

Other Stock-Based Awards.
    The MAPICS compensation committee may grant
other awards that are payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to shares of MAPICS common stock. These awards may include shares of common stock awarded purely as a bonus and not subject to
any restrictions or conditions, convertible or exchangeable debt securities and other rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of MAPICS common stock. In addition, these awards may be valued by reference to the book value of shares of MAPICS
common stock or the value of securities of or the performance of specified affiliated companies. The compensation committee will determine the terms and conditions of any such awards. During fiscal 2002, MAPICS did not grant any other stock-based
awards. 

Performance Goals.
    Pursuant to Section 13.13 of the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the MAPICS compensation committee may determine that any award will be determined solely on the basis of: 



the achievement by MAPICS or any of its subsidiaries of a specified target return, or target growth in return, on equity or on assets; 



MAPICS stock price or the stock price of any of its subsidiaries; 



the achievement by an employee or a business unit of a specified target, or target growth in, revenues, net income or earnings per share; 



the achievement of objectively determinable goals with respect to product delivery, product quality, customer satisfaction, meeting budgets and/or retention of
employees; or 



any combination of the goals set forth above. 

If an award is made on such basis, the MAPICS compensation committee must establish goals prior to the beginning of the period for which such performance goal relates (or such later date as may be
permitted under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code). The compensation committee may for any reason reduce, but not increase, any award, notwithstanding the achievement of a specified goal. Any payment of an award that has performance goals
will be conditioned on the written certification of the compensation committee that the performance goals and any other material conditions were satisfied. During fiscal 2002, MAPICS did not grant any awards that were determined solely on the basis
of these performance goals. 

Limitations on Transfer; Beneficiaries.
    No unexercised
or restricted award will be assignable or transferable by a participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, except in the case of an ISO, pursuant to a qualifying domestic relations order. However, the MAPICS compensation
committee may permit other transfers when the transfers do not result in accelerated taxation, do not cause any option intended to be an ISO to fail to be described in Internal Revenue Code Section 422(b), and are otherwise appropriate and
desirable, taking into account any factors deemed relevant. A participant may, in the manner determined by the compensation committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the participant and to receive any distribution with respect to
any award upon the participants death. 



Acceleration Upon Certain Events.
    Upon a
participants death, disability or retirement, all of such participants outstanding options, SARs and other awards in the nature of exercisable rights will become fully exercisable (and will remain exercisable for the full remaining term
unless otherwise provided) and all restrictions on outstanding awards will lapse. In the event of a change in control of MAPICS, as defined in the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, all outstanding options, SARs, and other awards in the nature of
exercisable rights will become fully vested and all restrictions on all outstanding awards will lapse. In addition, the compensation committee may, at any time, declare any or all outstanding options, SARs and other awards in the nature of
exercisable rights to become fully vested and/or all restrictions on all outstanding awards to lapse. 

Termination and Amendment 

The MAPICS board of directors or its compensation committee
may amend or terminate the MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan without shareholder approval unless an amendment would, in the reasonable opinion of the board of directors or the compensation committee, materially increase the benefits accruing to
participants, materially increase the number of shares issuable, materially modify the requirements for eligibility, or otherwise constitute a material change requiring shareholder approval under applicable laws, policies or regulations or the
applicable listing or other requirements of Nasdaq or a national securities exchange, in which case such amendment shall be subject to shareholder approval. In addition, the board or the committee may condition any amendment on the approval of the
shareholders for any other reason. The compensation committee may amend or terminate any outstanding award without approval of the participant; provided, however, that such amendment, modification or termination to an outstanding award or to the
MAPICS 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan may not, without the participants consent, reduce or diminish the value of the award determined as if the award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of the amendment or
termination. Unless approved by the shareholders or otherwise permitted by the antidilution provisions of the plan, the exercise price of an outstanding option may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, and the original term of any option may not
be extended. 

Certain Federal Income Tax Effects 

Non-qualified Stock
Options.
    Under present federal income tax regulations, there will be no federal income tax consequences to either MAPICS or the participant upon the grant of an NSO. The participant will realize ordinary income on the
exercise of the NSO in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the MAPICS common stock acquired over the exercise price, and MAPICS will receive a corresponding deduction. A subsequent sale or exchange of such shares will result in
gain or loss measured by the difference between the exercise price, increased by any compensation reported upon the participants exercise of the option, and the amount realized on such sale or exchange. This gain or loss will be capital in
nature if the shares were held as a capital asset and will be long-term if the shares were held for the applicable long-term capital gain holding period. 

Incentive Stock Options.
    Under present federal income tax regulations, there will be no federal income tax consequences to either MAPICS or the participant upon the grant
of an ISO or the participants exercise of the ISO. If the participant holds the shares of common stock for the greater of two years after the date the option was granted or one year after the acquisition of such shares of MAPICS common stock,
the difference between the aggregate exercise price and the amount realized upon disposition of the shares of MAPICS common stock will constitute a capital gain or loss, and MAPICS will not be entitled to a federal income tax deduction. If the
shares of MAPICS common stock are disposed of in a sale, exchange or other disqualifying disposition during the required holding period, the participant will realize taxable ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value
of the MAPICS common stock purchased at the time of exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the disposition of the shares) over the aggregate exercise price, and MAPICS will be entitled to a federal income tax deduction equal to such amount.
Upon exercise of an ISO, the participant may be subject to alternative minimum tax on certain items of tax preference. If an ISO is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies as an incentive stock option, the option will be treated as an NSO.



SARs.
    Under present federal income tax regulations,
a participant receiving a SAR will not recognize income, and MAPICS will not be allowed to take a tax deduction, at the time the award is granted. When a participant exercises the SAR, the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares of
MAPICS common stock received will be ordinary income to the participant, and MAPICS will be allowed to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes. 

Performance Units.
    Under present federal income tax regulations, a participant receiving performance units will not recognize income and MAPICS will not be allowed to take
a tax deduction at the time the award is granted. When a participant receives or has the right to receive payment of performance units, the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares of MAPICS common stock received will be ordinary
income to the participant, and MAPICS will be allowed to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m). 

Restricted Stock.
    Under present federal income tax regulations, and unless the participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of the
income to the date of grant, a participant receiving a restricted stock award will not recognize income, and MAPICS will not be allowed to take a tax deduction, at the time the award is granted. When the restrictions lapse, the participant will
recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the common stock (less any consideration paid), and MAPICS will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction at that time, subject to applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m).

In connection with MAPICS acquisition of Bryce Business Systems, MAPICS Australian independent sales affiliate, MAPICS issued to the owners of Bryce
options to acquire a total 24,060 shares of MAPICS common stock. The issuance of the options and related option shares was approved by the MAPICS board of directors but was not required to be, and therefore was not, submitted to MAPICS shareholders
for approval. Options for 10,365 of those shares were granted on October 1, 1992 at an exercise price of $15.39 per share and expired on September 30, 2002 unexercised. Options for the remaining 13,695 shares were granted on August 29, 1995 at an
exercise price of $7.88 per share. These options are fully vested, and the underlying shares remain available for issuance if the options are exercised.

increased competition from other software companies that make products competing with those of the combined company;

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2002 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
year ended September 30, 2002 give effect to the proposed merger, accounted for as a purchase transaction. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of MAPICS and
Frontstep using the assumptions and adjustments set forth in the accompanying notes. MAPICS has a September 30
th
 fiscal year-end while Frontstep has a fiscal year-end of June 30
th
. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations combines MAPICS statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and Frontsteps statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. In the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, MAPICS recorded an extraordinary item of $318,000, after tax, due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt, which has been excluded from the following historical and pro forma presentations. 

As part of its preliminary review of the allocation of the cost of its merger with Frontstep, MAPICS considered whether
acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships, patents, covenants not to compete, research and development, software and marketing agreements, might exist. As discussed in note 2, preliminary results from an independent
appraisal indicate the recognition of certain intangible assets. The excess of the cost over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is subject to change pending
the closing of the merger and the final results of the independent appraisal. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet is based on the historical consolidated balance sheets of MAPICS and Frontstep as of September 30, 2002 and gives effect to the merger as if the merger had been consummated at September 30, 2002. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations gives effect to the merger as if the merger had been consummated at October 1, 2001. While MAPICS believes that synergies and cost savings may result from the merger, the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information does not give effect to the anticipated synergies or cost savings in connection with the merger. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with MAPICS consolidated historical financial statements and those of Frontstep, including the respective notes to those financial
statements. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position and results of operations in the future, or of the combined financial position and the results of operations, which would have resulted had the
merger been consummated during the periods or as of the dates for which the pro forma information is presented.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

This section
sets forth (i) an unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2002, (ii) an unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002, and (iii) the related notes thereto. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of MAPICS and Frontstep included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of
MAPICS for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A of Frontstep for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, which are located at Annexes F and G to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical consolidated balance sheet of MAPICS and the
historical consolidated balance sheet of Frontstep, each as of September 30, 2002, as if the merger had been completed on September 30, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations combine the consolidated statement of
operations of MAPICS for the year ended September 30, 2002, and the consolidated statement of operations of Frontstep for the year ended June 30, 2002, as if the merger had been consummated on October 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information is intended for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the future financial position or future results of operations of the combined company, or of the financial position or results of
operations of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the merger been in effect as of the date or for the periods presented. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, certain
reclassifications have been made to Frontsteps historical amounts to conform to MAPICS presentation. 

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for financial accounting purposes as required by SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For purposes
of preparing MAPICS consolidated financial statements, MAPICS will establish a new basis for Frontsteps assets and liabilities based upon their fair values. MAPICS believes that any excess costs of the merger over the amounts assigned to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill. A final determination of the intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made. MAPICS will determine the fair value of Frontsteps assets and liabilities and will make appropriate purchase accounting adjustments upon completion of such
determination. However, for purposes of disclosing pro forma information in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, MAPICS has made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation based upon current estimates and assumptions, which is
subject to revision upon completion of the independent appraisal process following the merger. 

The key events
that need to occur before MAPICS can finalize its purchase price allocation include consummation of the merger and completion of the valuation of Frontsteps net assets, which is currently being performed. Factors such as the final balance
sheet of Frontstep prior to closing and the results of the final valuation of Frontstep will have an impact on the final purchase price allocation. MAPICS expects to complete this process during the allocation period within one year from the
consummation of the merger. 

Note 1.    Purchase Price 

The merger agreement provides that
shareholders of Frontstep will receive, in the aggregate, 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding Frontstep common shares as of the effective time of the merger. The assumed exchange ratio, .300846,
is determined by dividing 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock to be issued in the merger by the total number of Frontstep common shares outstanding at the time the merger is completed. The warrant held by Foothill will be exchanged for a new
warrant to acquire approximately 134,000 shares of MAPICS common stock. The Frontstep options will be converted into options to purchase shares of MAPICS common stock based on the exchange ratio. 



The total purchase price, based upon the issuance of 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS
common stock and the number of Frontstep options and the Foothill warrant to purchase Frontstep common shares outstanding at September 30, 2002, would be as follows (in thousands), except share data and the exchange ratio:

Represents the estimated fair value of Frontstep options to be converted to MAPICS options. The fair value of the Frontstep options was determined based upon
the MAPICS stock price of $7.41 on November 25, 2002 and an exchange ratio of .300846 using the Black-Scholes option valuation model assuming a risk-free rate of 2.5%, a volatility rate of 71% and expected remaining term of the options of 2.5 years.
The average remaining term of the options is 5.3 years. The final fair value will be based on the ultimate number of Frontstep options exchanged for MAPICS options. 

(3)

Represents the estimated fair value of the warrant held by Foothill adjusted based on the exchange ratio. The fair value of the warrant held by Foothill was
determined based upon the MAPICS stock price of $7.41 on November 25, 2002 and an exchange ratio of .300846 using the Black-Scholes valuation model assuming a risk free rate of 3.0%, a volatility rate of 71% and the remaining term of 3.3 years.

Note 3.    Pro Forma Adjustments 

The following are descriptions of
the pro forma purchase accounting and other merger-related adjustments, labeled (a) through (k), which have been reflected in the accompanying pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. The
adjustments are subject to change based on the consummation of the merger and the final results of the independent appraisal. Amounts set forth below are in thousands, except share data and the exchange ratio. 

(a)    The adjustment represents capitalized marketing collateral costs that are being written off to conform with
MAPICS policy of expensing such costs as incurred. 

(b)    The adjustment represents the
difference in the estimated fair market value of Frontsteps computer software costs compared to its carrying costs. The fair value of the computer software costs was based on the preliminary results of an independent appraisal. The amount of
the adjustment is subject to change pending the final appraisal results. 

(c)    The
adjustments of $15,531 and $5,818 represent the estimated increase to Frontsteps existing goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively, related to the merger. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the goodwill recorded in the merger will not
be amortized. The other intangible assets represent customer lists and trade names. The fair value of the intangibles was based on the preliminary results of an independent appraisal. The estimated average remaining life of the intangibles is five
years.

historical shareholders equity of $17,249, (ii) the issuance of 4,200,000 shares of MAPICS common stock at a total market value of $29,677 based on $7.07 per share and (iii) the estimated fair market value of Frontstep options and warrants of
$1,441 exchanged for MAPICS options and a warrant based on an exchange ratio of .300846. 

(h)    Represents the decrease in amortization of computer software costs of $3,990 due to the fair value established as discussed in note (b) as well as the new amortization of $982 of the identifiable intangible
assets discussed in note (c). The adjustment to amortization has been calculated as if the merger had been consummated at October 1, 2001. 

(i)    Represents the adjustments to the carrying value of Frontsteps outstanding debt and the reclassification of certain amounts from current to noncurrent based on the new credit facility MAPICS

borrowings would be variable rate debt with terms of LIBOR plus 3%. The adjustment was based on the assumption that this refinancing occurred on October 1, 2001 and is based on the month-end 3-month LIBOR rates plus 3% throughout the period October
1, 2001 through September 30, 2002. A change of 1/8% in the rate would change interest expense by approximately $16 for the period ended September 30, 2002.

to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Section 
3.5(b)

ARTICLE 4    EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

4.1    Exchange Procedures. 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time,
MAPICS shall make available to MAPICSs transfer agent or another exchange agent selected by MAPICS (the 
Exchange Agent
) for exchange in accordance with this Section 
4.1
 the shares of MAPICS Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement and cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.4. Promptly after the Effective Time, MAPICS and Frontstep shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Frontstep Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the 
Certificates
) appropriate transmittal materials and instructions (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent). The Certificate or Certificates of Frontstep Common Stock so delivered shall
be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Frontstep Common Stock represented by Certificates that is not registered in the transfer records of Frontstep, the consideration provided in
Section 
3.1

may be issued to a transferee if the Certificates representing such shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen
or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as MAPICS and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder
the consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have been converted. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its
duties as it may deem appropriate. MAPICS shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the distribution of the consideration provided in Section 
3.1.

(b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Frontstep Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(d)
or as to which statutory dissenters rights have been perfected as provided in Section 3.3) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares (or deliver an affidavit of lost
stock certificate, together with such bond, security or indemnity agreement as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require) to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon surrender or delivery thereof receive in exchange therefor the consideration
provided in Section 
3.1
 (without interest thereon) pursuant to Section 
3.2
.
 To the extent required by Section 3.4, each holder of shares of Frontstep Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time also shall
receive, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates, cash in lieu of any fractional share of MAPICS Common Stock to which such holder may be otherwise entitled (without interest). MAPICS shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to
which any former holder of Frontstep Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holders Certificate or Certificates for exchange as provided in this Section 
4.1
.

(c) Each of MAPICS, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Frontstep Common Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by MAPICS, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Frontstep Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by MAPICS, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

A-5 



(d) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of MAPICS, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of Frontstep Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of Frontstep shall constitute ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent.
