(1) This Registration Statement relates to securities of the registrant issuable
    to holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Interlott common
    stock"), of Interlott Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
    ("Interlott"), pursuant to the proposed merger of Interlott with and into a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant.

(2) Based on the maximum number of shares to be issued in connection with the
    merger, calculated as the product of (a) 7,902,494, the aggregate number of
    shares of Interlott common stock outstanding on April 22, 2003 (other than
    shares owned by Interlott, the registrant or the registrant's subsidiaries)
    or issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options prior to the
    date the merger is expected to be completed, (b) 0.515, representing the cap
    on the number of shares of Interlott common stock to be converted into GTECH
    common stock, and (c) an assumed exchange ratio of 0.2675 shares of the
    registrant's common stock for each share of Interlott common stock
    (representing $9.00 divided by $33.65, the closing sale price of the
    registrant's common stock on April 22, 2003).

(3) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    required by Section 6(b) of the Securities Act, and calculated pursuant to
    Rule 457(f) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to Rules 457(f)(1) and
    457(f)(3) under the Securities Act, the proposed maximum aggregate offering
    price of the registrant's common stock was calculated based upon (a) the
    market value of shares of Interlott common stock (the securities to be
    cancelled in the merger) in accordance with Rule 457(c) under the Securities
    Act, determined as the product of (i) $8.88, the average of the high and low
    prices per share of Interlott common stock on April 24, 2003, as reported on
    the American Stock Exchange, and (ii) 7,902,494, the maximum number of
    shares of Interlott common stock to be cancelled, less (b) the cash to be
    paid by the registrant in connection with the exchange of such aggregate
    number of shares of Interlott common stock (which equals $9.00 multiplied by
    48.5% of the total number of Interlott shares to be cancelled).

(4) Calculated by multiplying the proposed maximum offering price for all
    securities by 0.00008090.

    THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF

        PRELIMINARY PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS -- SUBJECT TO COMPLETION

                                [INTERLOTT LOGO]

                                  [ -- ], 2003
Dear Stockholder:

     You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting of stockholders of
Interlott Technologies, Inc. to be held on [ -- ], 2003, at 9:00 a.m., local
time, at [ADDRESS].

     At the special meeting, we will ask you to consider and vote on the
proposed merger of Interlott into GTECH Corporation, a subsidiary of GTECH
Holdings Corporation, and to approve Interlott's amended and restated 1994 Stock
Incentive Plan. In the merger, in exchange for each of your shares of Interlott
common stock, you may elect to receive, subject to proration as described below,
(1) $9.00 in cash or (2) a number of GTECH common shares having a value of $9.00
based on average closing prices over a specified period prior to the meeting.
GTECH common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GTK"
and closed at $[ -- ] per share on [ -- ], 2003.

     In connection with the merger, you may not receive all of your merger
consideration in the form that you elect. The merger agreement provides that the
percentage of shares of Interlott common stock that will be converted into the
right to receive GTECH common shares is fixed at 51.5% and the percentage of
shares of Interlott common stock that will be converted into the right to
receive cash is fixed at 48.5%. Therefore, the Interlott stockholders'
elections, including yours, may be adjusted on a pro rata basis so that, in the
aggregate, 51.5% of the Interlott common stock is converted into the right to
receive GTECH common shares and 48.5% of the Interlott common stock is converted
into the right to receive cash. The tax consequences of the transaction to you
will depend on which form of consideration you actually receive.

PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD.

     Following the recommendations of a special committee of Interlott's Board
of Directors appointed to evaluate the fairness of the proposed merger from the
point of view of Interlott's unaffiliated public stockholders, the Interlott
Board of Directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and recommends
that you vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. Information about the
proposed merger is contained in the enclosed proxy statement/prospectus. WE URGE
YOU TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING THE SECTION DESCRIBING RISK FACTORS THAT
BEGINS ON PAGE      .

     Interlott is a Delaware corporation. Under Delaware law, the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Interlott common
stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to adopt the merger
agreement. I have agreed to vote all of my shares in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. Because I own more than 50% of Interlott's
outstanding common stock, adoption of the merger agreement at the special
meeting is assured.

     Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares you own. To vote
your shares, you may use the enclosed proxy card, or attend the special meeting
of stockholders. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please
complete, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy card to assure that your
shares will be voted. IF YOU DO NOT VOTE, IT WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING
AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          L. Rogers Wells, Jr.

     NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
REGULATOR HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE MERGER DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS OR THE GTECH COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH

                           TO BE HELD ON [ -- ], 2003

To the Stockholders of INTERLOTT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.:

     We will hold a special meeting of the stockholders of Interlott
Technologies, Inc. on [ -- ], [ -- ], 2003, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at
[ADDRESS] for the following purposes:

          1. To consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended and
     Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 17, 2003, among
     Interlott Technologies, Inc., GTECH Holdings Corporation and certain wholly
     owned subsidiaries of GTECH. In the merger, Interlott will become a wholly
     owned subsidiary of GTECH, and each outstanding share of Interlott common
     stock, other than any shares held by parties to the merger agreement or by
     stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights under Delaware
     law, will be converted into the right to receive, subject to proration as
     described below, (a) $9.00 in cash or (b) a number of GTECH common shares
     having a value of $9.00, based on average closing prices over a period
     prior to the meeting.

          2. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Interlott
     Technologies, Inc. 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated
     effective January 15, 2003.

          3. To transact such other business as may properly come before the
     special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

     These items of business are described in this proxy statement/prospectus. A
copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Only holders of record of shares of Interlott common stock
at the close of business on [ -- ], 2003, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any
adjournments or postponements of it. A list of stockholders of Interlott as of
the close of business on [ -- ], 2003, will be available for inspection during
normal business hours from [ -- ], 2003 through [ -- ], 2003, at the
headquarters of Interlott, 7697 Innovation Way, Mason, Ohio.

     Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own.
Please submit your proxy as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are
represented at the meeting. To vote your shares, you may complete and return the
enclosed proxy card. If you are a holder of record, you may also cast your vote
in person at the special meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a
brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If
you do not vote or do not instruct your broker or bank on how to vote, it will
have the same effect as voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.

     PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD.

     Interlott stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement and comply with other requirements have the right to demand appraisal
of their shares of Interlott common stock and to receive payment in cash for the
fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Chancery Court. A copy
of the provisions of Delaware law that grant appraisal rights and specify the
required procedures for demanding appraisal is attached to the accompanying
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.

   Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH Holdings Corporation.
   Promptly following the merger, the assets and liabilities of the Interlott
   business will be transferred to a new, wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH
   Corporation, and the Interlott business will be continued as an indirect
   wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH Holdings.

Q: WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IS NEEDED?

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
   of Interlott common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement. The
   affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Interlott
   common stock represented at the special meeting is required to approve the
   amended and restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan. Mr. L. Rogers Wells, Jr., the
   holder of more than 50% of Interlott's common stock as of [ -- ], 2003, has
   agreed to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and indicated
   that he will vote in favor of approval of the Stock Incentive Plan. As a
   result, adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the Stock Incentive
   Plan by the Interlott stockholders at the special meeting is assured. No vote
   of GTECH stockholders is required in connection with the merger.

Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: You may elect the form of payment you prefer to receive in the merger. For
   each share of Interlott common stock you own, you have the right to elect to
   receive either:

     - $9.00 in cash; or

     - a number of GTECH common shares having a value of $9.00, based on the
       average trading price of GTECH common shares during a period of 20
       trading days immediately preceding the third business day before the
       special meeting of stockholders.

    The form of consideration that you receive will have important tax
    consequences for you, as described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
    "The Merger--Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
    Merger." You are not, however, assured of receiving either all GTECH common
    shares or all cash, notwithstanding your choice, as explained below.

Q: WILL I RECEIVE THE FORM OF PAYMENT THAT I CHOOSE?

A: Not necessarily. The merger agreement provides that the percentage of shares
   of Interlott common stock that will be converted into the right to receive
   GTECH common shares is fixed at 51.5% and the percentage of shares of
   Interlott common stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash
   is fixed at 48.5%. Therefore, the Interlott stockholders' elections,
   including yours, may be adjusted on a pro rata basis so that, in the
   aggregate, 51.5% of the Interlott common stock is converted into the right to
   receive GTECH common shares and 48.5% of the Interlott common stock is
   converted into the right to receive cash.

    For example, if holders of 75% of the shares of Interlott common stock
    choose to receive GTECH common shares and holders of 25% of the shares of
    Interlott common stock choose to receive cash, then:

     - if you choose to receive GTECH common shares, you will receive GTECH
       common shares in exchange for 68  2/3% of your shares of Interlott common
       stock and cash in exchange for 31 1/3% your shares of Interlott common
       stock; and

     - if you choose to receive cash, you will receive cash in exchange for all
       of your shares of Interlott common stock.

    On the other hand, if holders of 75% of the shares of Interlott common stock
    choose to receive cash and holders of 25% of the shares of Interlott common
    stock choose to receive GTECH common shares, then:

     - if you choose to receive GTECH common shares, you will receive GTECH
       common shares in exchange for all of your shares of Interlott common
       stock; and

     - if you choose to receive cash, you will receive cash in exchange for
       64 2/3% of your shares of Interlott common stock and GTECH common shares
       in exchange for 35 1/3% of your shares of Interlott common stock.

    If holders of 100% of the shares of Interlott common stock choose to receive
    all cash, then each holder will receive cash in exchange for 48.5% of that
    holder's shares of Interlott common stock and GTECH common shares in
    exchange for 51.5% of that holder's shares of Interlott common stock. The
    result will be the same if holders of 100% of the shares of Interlott common
    stock choose to receive all GTECH common shares.

Q: HOW DO I ELECT THE FORM OF PAYMENT I PREFER?

A: If your shares of Interlott common stock are held in registered form, you
   will receive in a separate mailing an election form which you should read
   carefully. You must return your completed and executed election form,
   together with your stock certificate, as described in the instructions
   contained in the election form, to elect the form of merger consideration
   that you prefer to receive.

    IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED VALID, YOUR ELECTION FORM MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
    EXCHANGE AGENT BY 5:00 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON [ -- ], 2003, WHICH IS
    THE FIFTH BUSINESS DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE SPECIAL MEETING.

    If your shares of Interlott common stock are held in a brokerage or other
    custodial account, you will receive instructions from the entity that holds
    your shares advising you of the procedures for making your election and
    delivering your shares.

Q: CAN I MAKE ONE ELECTION FOR SOME OF MY SHARES AND ANOTHER ELECTION FOR THE
   REST?

A: Yes. You may elect to receive a combination of cash and GTECH common shares.

Q: WHAT IF I FAIL TO MAKE AN ELECTION?

A: If you make no election, your shares will be allocated between the two forms
   of merger consideration after allocation of those shares for which an
   election is made. For example, if holders of more than 51.5% of Interlott's
   shares elect to receive stock, then you will receive cash. If holders of more
   than 48.5% of Interlott's shares elect to receive cash, you will receive
   stock. Under some circumstances, depending on the elections made by others,
   you could receive a combination of cash and stock.

Q: HOW SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A: If your shares of Interlott common stock are held in registered form and you
   make an election of consideration by returning a completed election form, you
   must send in your Interlott common stock certificates with your completed
   election form. If you do not make an election, then you must keep your stock
   certificates until after the merger is completed, at which time you will
   receive a letter of transmittal describing how you may exchange your
   certificates for merger consideration. DO NOT SEND YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES OR
   ELECTION FORM WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. If your shares are held in a brokerage or
   other custodial

   account, you will receive instructions from the entity that holds your shares
   advising you of the procedures for making your election and delivering your
   shares. ONCE YOU SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
   SELL YOUR SHARES UNLESS YOU REVOKE YOUR ELECTION AND HAVE THE CERTIFICATES
   RETURNED TO YOU.

Q: WHEN DO INTERLOTT AND GTECH EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: Interlott and GTECH are working to complete the merger as quickly as
   possible. The companies expect to complete the merger in the third calendar
   quarter of 2003. Because the merger is subject to Interlott stockholder and
   governmental approvals, as well as other conditions, we cannot predict the
   exact timing of its completion.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   proxy statement/prospectus, please respond by completing, signing and dating
   your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope as
   soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at the special
   meeting.

Q: WHAT IF I DO NOT VOTE?

A. If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the
   adoption of the merger agreement. If you respond and do not indicate how you
   want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote FOR the adoption of the
   merger agreement and FOR approval of the amended and restated 1994 Stock
   Incentive Plan. If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have
   the same effect as a vote AGAINST the adoption of the merger agreement and
   AGAINST approval of the Stock Incentive Plan.

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a
   written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you
   can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose either of these two
   methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the
   Secretary of Interlott at 7679 Innovation Way, Mason, Ohio 45040-9695, before
   the special meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage
   firm or a bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your
   vote. Third, if you are a holder of record, you can attend the special
   meeting and vote in person. However, merely attending the special meeting,
   without voting in person, will not revoke any proxy previously delivered by
   you.

Q: IF MY INTERLOTT SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER
   VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME?

A: Your broker will vote your Interlott shares on adoption of the merger
   agreement only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow
   the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker
   to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on
   that matter, which will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the adoption
   of the merger agreement.

Q: WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A: If you have any questions about the merger, or if you need additional copies
   of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy, you should contact:

                                 THE COMPANIES

INTERLOTT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
7697 Innovation Way
Mason, Ohio 45040-9695

     Interlott Technologies, Inc. is engaged primarily in the design,
manufacture, sale, lease and service of instant-winner lottery ticket vending
machines ("ITVMs"). ITVMs are used by public lotteries operated by state and
international public entities to dispense instant-winner lottery tickets
primarily in retail locations such as supermarkets and convenience stores. An
instant lottery commonly is played by players scratching off a latex coating
from a pre-printed ticket or tearing pull-tabs from a pre-printed ticket to
determine the outcome of the game. Interlott's ITVMs dispense instant lottery
tickets directly to players, thereby permitting the retailer or agent to sell
tickets without disrupting the normal duties of its employees.

     Interlott's ITVMs dispense scratch-off instant lottery tickets using a
dispensing process that incorporates Interlott's patented "burster technology."
Interlott believes that this burster technology is superior to any other ITVM
scratch-off dispensing technology on the market and considers it to be a key to
its marketing efforts and the ITVM procurement decisions of the various
lotteries. Interlott is unaware of any competitor that incorporates a
substantially equivalent or superior scratch-off dispensing mechanism in its
ITVMs. To dispense pull-tab instant lottery tickets, Interlott has developed an
ITVM that incorporates a patented dispensing technology which is different than
the burster technology but that is also believed by Interlott to be superior to
any other currently available pull-tab dispensing technology. ITVMs that
dispense pull-tab tickets are sometimes referred to herein as "pull tab vending
machines" or "PTVMs." The term "ITVM" includes both scratch-off vending machines
and PTVMs unless the context indicates otherwise.

     As of December 31, 2002, Interlott had sold or leased over 30,000 ITVMs
through agreements with 29 different state lotteries, the District of Columbia
and 14 international jurisdictions, or their licensees or contractors.

     Taking advantage of its expertise in dispensing technology, Interlott
introduced a prepaid phone card dispensing machine ("PCDM") in 1995 that enables
providers of long distance telephone service to dispense prepaid telephone
calling cards in retail locations without the assistance of an employee of the
retailer. The dispensing process used in Interlott's PCDM incorporates the same
patented technology used in Interlott's PTVM, and Interlott believes that this
dispensing technology is superior to any other PCDM dispensing technology on the
market. Although PCDM revenues in 2002 represented less than 1% of total
revenues, Interlott continues to believe that PCDMs may be a source of future
sales growth.

GTECH HOLDINGS CORPORATION
55 Technology Way
West Greenwich, Rhode Island 02817

     GTECH Corporation, a global information technology company providing
software, networks and professional services that power high-performance,
transaction processing solutions, is the world's leading operator of
highly-secure online lottery transaction processing systems. As a wholly owned
subsidiary of GTECH, GTECH Corporation currently operates online lottery systems
for, or supplies equipment and services to, 25 of the 39 online lottery
authorities in the United States, and currently operates, provides equipment and
services to, or has entered into contracts to operate or provide equipment and
services in the future to, online lottery systems for 59 of the 105
international online lottery authorities.

     GTECH provides integrated online lottery solutions, services and products
to governmental lottery authorities and governmental licensees worldwide. GTECH
offers its customers a full range of lottery technology services, including the
design, assembly, installation, operation, maintenance and marketing of online
lottery systems and instant ticket support systems. GTECH's lottery systems
consist of numerous lottery terminals located in retail outlets, central
computer systems, systems software and game software, and communications
equipment which connects the terminals and the central computer systems.

     Historically, the majority of GTECH's lottery customers in the United
States have entered into long-term service contracts (typically at least five
years in duration) pursuant to which GTECH provides, operates and maintains the
customers' online lottery systems in return for a percentage of the gross
lottery sales. Many of GTECH's international lottery customers have purchased
their online lottery systems, although some, especially lottery authorities in
Eastern Europe and Latin America, have entered into long-term service contracts
with GTECH. In recent years there has been, in general, an industry movement
away from product sales in favor of long-term service contracts. In fiscal 1993,
approximately 70% of GTECH's lottery revenues were derived from its portfolio of
long-term online lottery service contracts with substantially all of the
remainder being derived from lottery product sales. In fiscal 2003 (which ended
on February 22, 2003) approximately 88% of GTECH's lottery revenues were derived
from online lottery service contracts.

     In recent years, lottery authorities have recognized that by offering new
games or products, they often are able to generate significant additional
revenues. An important part of GTECH's strategy is to develop new products and
services for its customers in order to increase their lottery revenues.
Indicative online products and services introduced recently to increase lottery
revenues for GTECH's customers include Aladdin(TM), the Extra-Online(TM)game,
and e-scratch(TM). Aladdin(TM) is a credit-card sized lottery ticket that,
through the use of magnetic strip and thermal printing technology, can be reused
up to 500 times, and which also can be employed in various non-lottery
commercial contexts. The Extra-Online(TM) game is an online lottery game that
permits players to purchase an additional game with instant-ticket features,
thus enhancing wagering interest. GTECH's e-scratch(TM) product is a web-based
interactive suite of scratch and reveal games that combines the security and
convenience of online play with the entertainment, branded content and immediate
gratification of instant-tickets. In recent years, GTECH has also introduced
various instant-ticket support services, products and systems to assist its
lottery customers in increasing revenue. GTECH currently provides instant-
ticket support services, products and systems in 24 domestic jurisdictions and
26 jurisdictions outside of the United States.

     In recent years, GTECH has taken steps to broaden its offerings of
high-volume transaction processing services outside of its core market of
providing online lottery services. In February 2003 (since the close of fiscal
2003), GTECH entered into an agreement to purchase a controlling equity position
in PolCard S.A., a leading debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer
and processor in Poland. This agreement provides for the purchase of
approximately 99.7% of the outstanding share capital of PolCard from its present
shareholders, a group of Polish banks and a travel services company, Orbis S.A.
The acquisition of PolCard will be effected through a Polish company created for
purposes of the acquisition. After completion of the acquisition, GTECH will own
62.8% of PolCard's outstanding equity, two funds managed by Innova Capital Sp.
zo.o, a Warsaw-based private equity investment advisor, will own 36.9% of
PolCard's outstanding equity, and the Polish Bank Association, one of PolCard's
current owners, will continue to own 0.3% of the

outstanding equity of PolCard. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by GTECH
and Innova for the PolCard equity to be acquired, together with approximately $2
million in debt assumed as part of the transaction, is expected to be
approximately $62 million. Consummation of the PolCard acquisition is contingent
upon the approval of the Polish Competition and Consumer Protection Office and
the Polish Bank Association, and is subject to certain other closing conditions.
GTECH has the option to purchase Innova's interest in PolCard, and Innova has
the reciprocal right to sell its interest in PolCard to GTECH, during the period
commencing approximately four, and ending approximately six, years after the
closing. GTECH expects the closing of the PolCard acquisition to occur in June
2003. GTECH believes that the acquisition of PolCard will permit it to leverage
its existing infrastructure in Poland in the development of its commercial
services product offerings.

                         THE SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE   )

GENERAL (PAGE   )

     Interlott will hold a special meeting of stockholders on [ -- ], 2003, at
9:00 a.m. local time, at which you will be asked to adopt the merger agreement
and to approve the amended and restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan.

RECORD DATE; STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM (PAGE   )

     Each share of Interlott common stock outstanding as of [ -- ], 2003,
entitles its holder to one vote on any matter to be considered at the special
meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Interlott common stock is required for a quorum for the transaction of
business at the special meeting.

PROXIES; REVOCATION; SOLICITATION (PAGE   )

     If you vote your shares of Interlott common stock by signing and dating
your proxy card, your shares will be voted at the special meeting as you
indicate on your proxy card. If no instructions are indicated on your signed
proxy card, your shares of Interlott common stock will be voted "FOR" adoption
of the merger agreement and "FOR" approval of the amended and restated Interlott
1994 Stock Incentive Plan. If your shares are held in street name, you should
follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your
broker to vote your shares. If you mark your proxy card "ABSTAIN" or do not
return your proxy card or instruct your broker how to vote, it will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement. Abstentions
also will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" approval of the amended and
restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan. Broker non-votes will have no
effect on approval of the Stock Incentive Plan, as these are treated as absent
shares.

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the special
meeting by submitting a written revocation to the Secretary of Interlott at 7679
Innovation Way, Mason, Ohio 45040-9695, or by submitting a new proxy, in either
case, dated after the date of the proxy that is being revoked. In addition, a
proxy may be revoked by voting in person at the special meeting. Simply
attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke your proxy.

REQUIRED VOTE (PAGE   )

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Interlott common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is necessary
for the adoption of the merger agreement. GTECH has entered into a stockholder
voting and option agreement with L. Rogers Wells, Jr., the Chairman of
Interlott, who beneficially owns and has voting control of more than 50% of the
shares of Interlott common stock outstanding as of the record date for the
special meeting. Under the stockholder voting and option agreement, Mr. Wells
has agreed to vote all of his shares of Interlott common stock in favor of
adoption of the merger

agreement. As a result, adoption of the merger agreement by the Interlott
stockholders at the special meeting is assured.

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Interlott common stock represented in person or proxy at the special meeting is
required to approve Interlott's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated. Mr. Wells has advised Interlott that he intends to vote all his shares
in favor of this proposal. Accordingly, adoption of this proposal is also
assured.

     On the record date, the directors and executive officers of Interlott
beneficially owned, in the aggregate, [ -- ] shares of Interlott common stock,
or approximately [ -- ]% of the shares of Interlott common stock outstanding on
that date.

                              THE MERGER (PAGE   )

     A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it
is the principal document governing the merger.

FORM OF MERGER AND CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER (PAGES   AND   )

     In the merger, Interlott will merge with and into GTECH Corporation, a
wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH. Promptly following the merger, the assets and
liabilities of the Interlott business will be transferred to a new, wholly owned
subsidiary of GTECH Corporation. Under the merger agreement, Interlott
stockholders will have the right to elect to receive either $9.00 in cash or a
number of GTECH common shares having a value of $9.00 (based upon average
trading prices over a twenty trading day period immediately prior to the third
trading day before the special meeting) for each share of Interlott common stock
that they hold. The overall percentage of shares of Interlott common stock that
will be converted into the right to receive GTECH common shares is fixed at
51.5% and the percentage of shares of Interlott common stock that will be
converted into the right to receive cash is fixed at 48.5%. Therefore, the
elections of all the holders of Interlott common stock, including yours, may be
adjusted on a pro rata basis so that, in the aggregate, 51.5% of the shares are
converted into the right to receive GTECH common shares and 48.5% of the shares
are converted into the right to receive cash. The form of consideration that you
receive will have important tax consequences for you, as described in this proxy
statement/prospectus under "The Merger--Material United States Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger."

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE      )

     Under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, if you notify
Interlott before the special meeting of your intent to seek appraisal, and you
do not vote your outstanding shares of Interlott common stock in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement and follow other specified procedures, you will
be entitled to dissent and elect to have the "fair value" of your shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, judicially
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and paid to you in cash. The
complete text of Section 262 is attached as Annex D.

     If you consider seeking appraisal, you should be aware that the fair value
of your shares as determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as
or less than the $9.00 per share payment (in cash or GTECH common shares) you
would be entitled to elect to receive under the merger agreement if you did not
seek appraisal of your shares.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERLOTT BOARD OF DIRECTORS (PAGE      )

     Following the recommendations of a special committee of the board of
directors appointed to evaluate the fairness of the merger from the point of
view of Interlott's unaffiliated public stockholders, the Interlott Board of
Directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and
determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of, Interlott and its stockholders.

Interlott's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Interlott
stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the
special meeting.

     The Board of Directors also recommends that Interlott stockholders vote
"FOR" approval of the amended and restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan.

       party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
       the merger agreement if the breach would cause the specified conditions
       to the merger not to be satisfied;

     - by GTECH or by Interlott, if they do not complete the merger on or before
       September 17, 2003 (unless the delay has been caused by the party seeking
       to terminate the agreement);

     - by GTECH or by Interlott, if any legal restraint to the merger is in
       effect and has become final and unappealable;

     - by GTECH or by Interlott, if Interlott's stockholders fail to approve the
       merger at the special meeting;

     - by GTECH, if the Interlott Board of Directors:

        - withdraws, or modifies in a manner adverse to GTECH, its
          recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger, or

        - approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal;

     - by GTECH, if Interlott enters into an agreement with respect to an
       alternative acquisition proposal;

     - by Interlott at any time prior to obtaining Interlott stockholder
       approval:

        - in response to an unsolicited bona fide offer by a third party to
          acquire more than 80% of Interlott common stock or all or
          substantially all the assets of Interlott for consideration that the
          Interlott Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
          consultation with a financial advisor, to be more favorable from a
          financial point of view to Interlott stockholders than the merger,
          taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement
          offered by GTECH, and either:

           - the Interlott Board withdraws or modifies its approval of the
             merger agreement and the merger, or

           - Interlott enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such a
             proposal, and

        - provided that Interlott may not so terminate until:

           - at least one business day after Interlott notified GTECH that it or
             its Board is taking such action as described above, and

           - Interlott has paid to GTECH the termination fee described below;

     - by GTECH, if three business days before the date of the special meeting
       of Interlott stockholders, the average closing price of GTECH common
       stock for the previous 20 trading days is less than $25.12; or

     - by GTECH or Interlott if the special committee of Interlott's Board has
       requested but has not received an opinion from its financial advisor
       dated as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus to the effect
       described in "The Merger-Opinion of Interlott's Financial Advisor."

     If GTECH decides to terminate the merger agreement under the next to last
bullet above, however, Interlott will have the option to proceed with the merger
on an all-cash basis. If that happens, the parties will amend the merger
agreement to reflect this, and you will receive a new proxy statement describing
the changes.

TERMINATION FEE (PAGE      )

     The merger agreement provides that Interlott will pay GTECH a termination
fee of $2.75 million, plus GTECH's out of pocket expenses up to $750,000, if:

     - GTECH or Interlott terminates the merger agreement as a result of
       Interlott's stockholders failing to approve the merger at the special
       meeting,

     - GTECH terminates the merger agreement as a result of the Interlott Board
       withdrawing, modifying or changing its approval or recommendation of the
       merger and the adoption of the merger agreement, or recommending an
       alternative acquisition proposal, or Interlott entering into an agreement
       with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal, or

     - Interlott terminates the merger agreement as a result of its Board of
       Directors withdrawing or modifying its approval or recommendation, or its
       entering into an agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition
       proposal.

     In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated for any other reason
except a breach by GTECH, then Interlott will pay GTECH's out-of-pocket expenses
(up to $750,000) if Interlott consummates a transaction concerning a superior
acquisition proposal within 12 months of the date of termination.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (PAGE      )

     GTECH has entered into an amended and restated stockholder voting and
option agreement with L. Rogers Wells, Jr., the Chairman of Interlott. Pursuant
to this agreement, Mr. Wells has agreed to vote his shares, which represent more
than 50% of the outstanding Interlott common stock as of the record date for the
special meeting, in favor of the merger and against any action that could impede
the merger. As a result, adoption of the merger agreement by the Interlott
stockholders at the special meeting is assured. A copy of the stockholder
agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.

     This stockholder agreement also gives GTECH the right to buy Mr. Wells'
shares, under some circumstances, if the merger is not completed and the merger
agreement is terminated. If GTECH exercises that option, it has agreed with
Interlott and with Mr. Wells that, to the extent permitted by law, it will make
a tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Interlott at the same
price. There is no guarantee, however, that GTECH will exercise the right to buy
Mr. Wells' shares even if the merger agreement is terminated under the
conditions that would give it that right.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (PAGE      )

     When you consider the recommendation of the Interlott Board of Directors
that you vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, you should keep in
mind that a number of executive officers and directors of Interlott have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder. The executive officers' additional interests arise
primarily in connection with their continued employment following the
consummation of the merger and the compensation they will receive in connection
with that employment. These interests also include:

     - the continuance of directors' and officers' liability insurance, rights
       of indemnification and advancement of expenses, in each case, for the
       benefit of current and former Interlott directors and officers, and

     - the accelerated vesting of all stock options of Interlott, including
       stock options held by Interlott directors and executive officers.

     When it signed the merger agreement, GTECH also entered into a
noncompetition agreement with Mr. Wells under which, in exchange for Mr. Wells'
agreement not to compete in any fashion with GTECH by engaging or proposing to
engage in any lottery business for a period of five years, GTECH has agreed to
pay Mr. Wells $250,000 per year for each of those five years.

REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE      )

     Transactions such as the merger are reviewed by the United States
Department of Justice and the United States Federal Trade Commission to
determine whether they comply with applicable antitrust laws. Under the
provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the
related rules and regulations, the merger may not be completed until applicable
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. GTECH and Interlott each filed
notification reports with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on April 1, 2003, and have requested an early
termination of the required waiting period. If early termination of the required
waiting period is not granted and a request for additional information by the
relevant antitrust authorities is not made, the waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 will expire at midnight on May
1, 2003.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (PAGE
     )

     The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, so that holders of Interlott
common stock will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income
tax purposes as a result of the merger, except to the extent of any cash
received as part of the merger consideration and any cash received instead of
fractional shares of GTECH common stock or because of the exercise of appraisal
rights. The merger is conditioned on the receipt of legal opinions that the
merger will qualify as a reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes. Under certain circumstances, the GTECH common stock portion of the
merger consideration may be increased and the cash portion of the merger
consideration may be decreased in order to enable these legal opinions to be
delivered and the merger to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.

     TAX MATTERS ARE VERY COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN
TAX ADVISOR FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE      )

     The merger will be treated as a "purchase" for accounting purposes.

EXPENSES (PAGE      )

     Each of GTECH and Interlott will bear all expenses it incurs in connection
with the merger, except under the circumstances described above under
"--Termination Fee" and except that Interlott will pay all expenses relating to
the printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus.

COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS (PAGE      )

     Interlott stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by Interlott's
amended certificate of incorporation and amended by-laws, may, upon completion
of the merger, become stockholders of GTECH, at which time their rights will be
governed by GTECH's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended
by-laws. Both GTECH and Interlott are Delaware corporations, so Interlott
stockholders' rights will continue to be governed by Delaware law after they
become stockholders of GTECH.

OWNERSHIP OF GTECH FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Based on the number of outstanding shares of Interlott common stock on the
record date and the closing price of GTECH common stock on [ -- ], 2003,
Interlott stockholders will be entitled to receive, in the aggregate,
approximately [ -- ] shares of GTECH common stock pursuant to the merger. Based
on that number and on the number of outstanding shares of GTECH common stock on
[ -- ], 2003, Interlott stockholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately
[ -- ]% of the outstanding shares of GTECH common stock following the merger.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF INTERLOTT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (PAGE      )

     Interlott's financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial
Advisors, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey"), has delivered a written opinion to the
special committee of the Interlott Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Interlott's unaffiliated
public stockholders. A copy of the full text of Houlihan Lokey's written
opinion, dated March 16, 2003, is attached to this document as Annex C. We
encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description
of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken. HOULIHAN LOKEY'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE SPECIAL
COMMITTEE OF THE INTERLOTT BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER.

                      STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION

COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICES

     The table below presents the New York Stock Exchange closing market price
for GTECH common shares, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transaction Tape under the symbol "GTK," and the last reported sale price of the
Interlott common stock, as reported on the American Stock Exchange under the
symbol "ILI," and equivalent per share date. These prices are presented on two
dates:

     - March 14, 2003, the last trading day before the public announcement of
       the signing of the merger agreement; and

     - [ -- ], 2003, the latest practicable date before the printing of this
       document.

     The exchange ratio, meaning the number of GTECH common shares you will
receive for each share of Interlott common stock, will be the quotient of $9.00
divided by the average per share closing price of GTECH common stock for the 20
trading days immediately preceding the third trading day before the special
meeting. The $9.00 per share merger consideration (in cash or GTECH common
shares) represents a premium of approximately 14.6% over the closing price per
share of Interlott common stock on March 14, 2003.

     Neither GTECH nor Interlott has paid cash dividends on its common stock to
date and neither has plans to do so. Interlott currently intends to retain all
future earnings for use in the development of its business. The current policy
of GTECH's Board of Directors is to reinvest earnings in the operation and
expansion of the company's business and, from time to time, to execute
repurchases of shares of GTECH common stock under the company's share repurchase
programs. Further, GTECH is a holding company and its operations are conducted
through its operating subsidiary, GTECH Corporation, and its subsidiaries.
Accordingly, the ability of GTECH to pay dividends on its common stock would be
dependent on the earnings and cash flow of its subsidiaries and the availability
of such cash flow to GTECH.

                       COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The following tables show per share data regarding the earnings and book
value of GTECH and Interlott. All per share data of GTECH have been restated to
account for GTECH's two-for-one stock split in May 2002. GTECH's fiscal year
ends on the last Saturday of every February, and Interlott's fiscal year ends on
December 31 of each year.

     In addition to financial results actually achieved by each of GTECH and
Interlott (the "historical" figures), the tables show results on an unaudited,
pro forma basis reflecting the merger accounted for as a

purchase, as if it had been consummated as of February 22, 2003 for the purposes
of presenting pro forma book value per share and as of February 23, 2002 for the
purposes of presenting pro forma earnings per share (the "pro forma combined"
figures). Because GTECH and Interlott have different fiscal year ends, pro forma
book value and earnings per share have been calculated by combining the balance
sheets and income statements, respectively, of GTECH and Interlott as of and for
the years ended February 22, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The pro
forma combined figures in the table are presented for comparative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results
of operations in the future or what the combined financial position or results
of operations would have been had the merger been completed and the applicable
purchase accounting adjustments been reflected during the period or as of the
date for which this pro forma data are presented.

     The pro forma combined per share information does not include any
adjustments related to any restructuring charges, profit improvements, potential
costs savings, or one-time charges which may result from the merger or the final
result of valuations of receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets, debt, and other obligations. GTECH and Interlott are
currently developing plans to integrate the operations of the companies, which
could involve actions including, among others, severance and settlement of
operating and capital commitments, which are material. The merger has not been
consummated as of the date of the preparation of this pro forma per share
information and there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated in
the future. The pro forma per share information is based on estimates and
assumptions that might be different had this pro forma per share information
been prepared after the consummation of the merger.

     The GTECH pro forma combined share amounts were calculated assuming $9.00
per share in cash was paid for 48.5% of the Interlott common stock outstanding
as of April 22, 2003 and GTECH common shares were issued for the remaining 51.5%
of the Interlott common stock outstanding as of April 22, 2003 as discussed
under "The Merger--Consideration to be Received in the Merger." These
calculations also assume that all outstanding options to purchase Interlott
common stock as of April 22, 2003, including those held by executive officers
and directors of Interlott, will vest in connection with the merger and the
holders will receive cash payments in an amount per share subject to those
options equal to the excess, if any, of $9.00 over the exercise price as
discussed under "Treatment of Interlott Stock Options."

     The Interlott pro forma equivalent amounts were calculated by multiplying
the GTECH pro forma combined share amounts by an assumed exchange ratio of
0.2673. This assumed exchange ratio represents the fraction of a share of GTECH
common stock an Interlott stockholder who elects to and is entitled to receive
only GTECH common shares would receive for each share of Interlott common stock
in the merger. This assumed exchange ratio was calculated by dividing $9.00
(total consideration for each share of Interlott common stock) by $33.67, the
average closing price for GTECH common stock for the 20 trading days ending on
April 22, 2003, assuming there is no proration requiring the Interlott common
stockholder to receive cash. The final exchange ratio may be different from the
ratio used in calculating the pro forma equivalent amounts because the final
ratio will be based on the 20 day average closing price of GTECH common shares
immediately preceding the third business day before the special meeting of
Interlott stockholders to be held on [               ], 2003. Should the final
average closing price of GTECH common shares decrease or increase by 15%, the
ratio will increase or decrease to 0.3145 or 0.2324, respectively. However, as
discussed under "The Merger Agreement--Termination," GTECH may terminate the
merger agreement if the 20 day average closing price of GTECH common stock
immediately preceding the third business day before the special meeting is less
than $25.12 (subject to Interlott's option to elect to proceed with the merger
on an all-cash basis).

                                  RISK FACTORS

     AN INVESTMENT IN GTECH COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A NUMBER OF RISKS, SOME OF
WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE MERGER AND SOME OF WHICH ARE INHERENT IN AN INVESTMENT
IN GTECH. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ABOUT THESE
RISKS, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT / PROSPECTUS,
IN CONSIDERING THE PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN GTECH AND INTERLOTT AND YOUR ELECTION
TO RECEIVE CASH AND/OR GTECH COMMON SHARES IN THE PROPOSED MERGER.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF GTECH AND INTERLOTT FOLLOWING THE MERGER WILL
PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.  The merger will present challenges to GTECH's
management, including the integration of Interlott's operations and personnel.
In addition, it may present special risks, including possible unanticipated
liabilities, unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention. GTECH
may not be able to integrate successfully or manage profitably the operations it
will acquire in the merger. Following the merger, GTECH may not achieve the
revenue or profitability increases or cost savings currently anticipated to
arise from the merger. If GTECH's management is not able to implement a business
plan that effectively integrates Interlott's operations, the anticipated
benefits of the merger may not be realized.

     YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE THE FORM OF MERGER CONSIDERATION THAT YOU ELECT.  In
connection with the merger, you may not receive all of your merger consideration
in the form that you elect. The merger agreement provides that the percentage of
shares of Interlott common stock that will be converted into the right to
receive GTECH common shares is fixed at 51.5% and the percentage of shares of
Interlott common stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash is
fixed at 48.5%. Therefore, the Interlott stockholders' elections, including
yours, may be adjusted on a pro rata basis so that, in the aggregate, 51.5% of
the Interlott common stock is converted into the right to receive GTECH common
shares and 48.5% of the Interlott common stock is converted into the right to
receive cash.

     THE PRICE OF GTECH COMMON STOCK AT THE CLOSING OF AND FOLLOWING THE MERGER
MAY VARY FROM THE TWENTY-DAY AVERAGE PRICE USED TO DETERMINE THE EXCHANGE RATIO
FOR THE MERGER.  The price of GTECH common stock may vary as a result of changes
in the business, operations or prospects of GTECH, general market and economic
conditions and other factors. The number of shares of GTECH common stock issued
in the merger will be calculated based on an exchange ratio equal to $9.00
divided by the average per share closing price of GTECH common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the third
trading day before the date of the special meeting. The market value of the
GTECH common stock on the date on which the merger is completed and following
the merger may be different than the 20-day average price of GTECH common stock
used in determining the exchange ratio. As a result, the market value of the
GTECH shares you may receive pursuant to the merger and hold following the
merger may be more or less than the $9.00 value assumed in calculating the
exchange ratio.

     THE PRICE OF GTECH COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE AFFECTING THE PRICE OF INTERLOTT COMMON STOCK.  Upon completion of the
merger, and depending on the form of merger consideration elected by holders of
Interlott common stock in the aggregate, many or all holders of Interlott common
stock will become holders of GTECH common stock. GTECH's business differs from
that of Interlott, and GTECH's results of operations, as well as the price of
GTECH common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting
Interlott's results of operations and the price of Interlott common stock. For a
discussion of GTECH's and Interlott's businesses and certain factors to consider
in connection with such businesses, we refer you to the quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q and the annual reports on Form 10-K that GTECH and Interlott have
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See "Where You Can Find More
Information."

     OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF INTERLOTT MAY HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT
ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF INTERLOTT'S STOCKHOLDERS.  A number of officers and
directors of Interlott who recommend that you vote in favor of the merger
agreement have employment or severance agreements or benefit arrangements that
provide them with interests in the merger that may be different from yours. The
receipt of compensation or

other benefits in connection with the merger (including the acceleration of
vesting of stock options), or the continuation of indemnification arrangements
for current directors following completion of the merger, may influence these
persons in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement. See "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger."

             RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN GTECH COMMON STOCK

     GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIONS AFFECTING THE ONLINE LOTTERY
INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GTECH'S BUSINESS.  In the United States
and in many international jurisdictions where GTECH currently operates or seeks
to do business, online lotteries are not permitted unless expressly authorized
by law. GTECH may not be able successfully to implement its growth strategy and
its business could be materially adversely affected if jurisdictions that do not
currently authorize lotteries do not approve online lotteries or if those
jurisdictions that currently authorize lotteries do not continue to permit such
activities.

     Once authorized, the ongoing operations of lotteries and lottery operators
are typically subject to extensive and evolving regulation. Lottery authorities
generally conduct an intensive investigation of the winning vendor and its
employees prior to and after the award of a lottery contract. Lottery
authorities with which GTECH does business may require the removal of any of its
employees deemed to be unsuitable and are generally empowered to disqualify it
from receiving a lottery contract or operating a lottery system as a result of
any such investigation. Some jurisdictions also require extensive personal and
financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities
beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically five percent or more) of
GTECH's securities. The failure of these beneficial owners to submit to these
background checks and provide required disclosure could jeopardize the award of
a lottery contract to GTECH or provide grounds for termination of an existing
lottery contract. Additional restrictions are often imposed by international
jurisdictions in which GTECH markets its lottery systems upon foreign
corporations, such as GTECH, seeking to do business there.

     Further, there have been and may continue to be investigations of various
types, including grand jury investigations, conducted by governmental
authorities into possible improprieties and wrong-doing in connection with
efforts to obtain and/or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters.
In light of the fact that these investigations frequently are conducted in
secret, GTECH may not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation
which might involve it. Because GTECH's reputation for integrity is an important
factor in its business dealings with lottery and other governmental agencies, a
governmental allegation or a finding of improper conduct on the part of GTECH or
attributable to it in any manner could have a material adverse effect on its
business, including its ability to retain and renew existing contracts or to
obtain new contracts. In addition, continuing adverse publicity resulting from
these investigations and related matters could have a material adverse effect on
GTECH's reputation and business.

     Finally, sales generated by online lottery games are dependent upon
decisions over which GTECH has no control made by lottery authorities with
respect to the operation of these games, such as matters relating to the
marketing and prize payout features of online lottery games. Because GTECH is
typically compensated in whole or in part based on a jurisdiction's gross online
lottery sales, lower than anticipated sales due to these factors could have a
material adverse effect on GTECH's revenues.

     GTECH'S LOTTERY OPERATIONS ARE DEPENDENT UPON ITS CONTINUED ABILITY TO
RETAIN AND EXTEND ITS EXISTING CONTRACTS AND WIN NEW CONTRACTS.  GTECH derives
the majority of its revenues and cash flow from its portfolio of long-term
facilities management contracts and operating contracts (or collectively, its
online lottery service contracts). Upon the expiration of a contract, lottery
authorities may award new contracts through a competitive procurement process.
In addition, GTECH's lottery contracts typically permit a lottery authority to
terminate the contract at any time for failure to perform and other specified
reasons. Many of GTECH's contracts permit the lottery authority to terminate the
contract at will with limited notice and do not specify the compensation, if
any, to which GTECH would be entitled were such termination to occur.

     In addition, some of GTECH's lottery contracts permit the lottery authority
to acquire title to its system-related equipment and software during the term of
the contract or upon the expiration or earlier termination of

the contract, in some cases without paying GTECH any compensation related to the
transfer of that equipment and software to the lottery authority.

     The termination of or failure to renew or extend one or more lottery
contracts, the renewal or extension of one or more lottery contracts on
materially altered terms or the loss of GTECH's assets without compensation
could, depending upon the circumstances, have a material adverse effect on
GTECH's business, financial condition, results and prospects.

     SLOW GROWTH OR DECLINES IN SALES OF ONLINE LOTTERY GOODS AND SERVICES COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT GTECH'S FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.  In recent years, as
the United States lottery industry has matured, the rate of lottery sales growth
has slowed and certain of GTECH's customers have from time to time experienced a
downward trend in sales. These developments may in part reflect increased
competition that the lottery industry has experienced in recent years for the
consumers' entertainment dollar, including by virtue of a proliferation of
destination gaming venues, and an increased availability of Internet gaming
opportunities. GTECH's future success will depend, in part, on the success of
the lottery industry, as a whole, in attracting and retaining players in the
face of such increased competition for the consumers' entertainment dollar
(which competition may well increase further in the future), as well as its own
success in developing innovative products and systems to achieve this goal.
GTECH's future success also will depend, in part, on its ability to develop
innovative products and services to permit it to successfully market transaction
processing goods and services outside of the lottery industry. GTECH's failure
to achieve these goals could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results and prospects.

     GTECH HAS SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.  GTECH's consolidated
financial results are significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current
transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than
United States dollars and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet
accounts into United States dollar balance sheet accounts. GTECH is exposed to
currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant portion of its
revenues is denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. These
exchange rate fluctuations have in the past adversely affected GTECH's operating
results and may continue to adversely affect its results of operations and the
value of its assets outside the United States.

     GTECH IS SUBJECT TO THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY RISKS OF
DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  GTECH is a global business and derives
a substantial portion of its revenue from its operations outside the United
States. In particular, in fiscal 2003, GTECH derived approximately 49% of its
revenues from its international operations and approximately 10.3% of its
revenues from its Brazilian operations alone (including 9.8% of its revenues
from the National Lottery of Brazil, GTECH's largest customer in fiscal 2003
based on annual revenues). In addition, a substantial portion of GTECH's assets
are held outside of the United States. GTECH is also exposed to more general
risks of international operations, including:

     - increased governmental regulation of the online lottery industry in the
       markets where it operates;

     - exchange controls or other currency restrictions; and

     - significant political instability.

     The occurrence of any of these events in the markets where GTECH operates
could jeopardize or limit its ability to transact business in those markets in
the manner it expects and could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results and prospects.

     GTECH HAS A CONCENTRATED CUSTOMER BASE AND THE LOSS OF ANY OF THESE
CUSTOMERS COULD HARM ITS RESULTS. Revenue from GTECH's top ten customers
accounted for approximately 48.6% of its total revenue for the fiscal year ended
February 22, 2003. If GTECH were to lose any of these larger customers, or if
these larger customers experience slow lottery ticket sales and consequently
reduced lottery revenue, GTECH's business, financial condition, results and
prospects could suffer.

     GTECH'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.  GTECH has
experienced and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in its
operating results from quarter to quarter due to such factors as the amount and
timing of product sales, the occurrence of large jackpots in lotteries (which
increase

the amount wagered and GTECH's revenue) and expenses incurred in connection with
lottery start-ups. Fluctuations in GTECH's operating results from quarter to
quarter may cause its operating results to be below the expectations of
securities analysts and investors. If this occurs, the trading price of GTECH's
common stock could fluctuate significantly.

     GTECH OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.  The online lottery
industry is becoming increasingly competitive in the United States and
internationally, which could adversely affect GTECH's ability to win renewals of
contracts from its existing customers or to win contract awards from other
lottery authorities. In addition, awards of contracts to GTECH are, from time to
time, challenged by its competitors. Increased competition also may have a
material adverse effect on the profitability of contracts which GTECH does
obtain.

     GTECH CAN BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER
ITS LOTTERY CONTRACTS. GTECH's lottery contracts typically permit termination of
the contract at any time for failure of GTECH to perform and for other specified
reasons and generally contain demanding implementation and performance
schedules. In addition to contract termination, failure to perform under these
contracts may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages. These
provisions in GTECH's lottery contracts present an ongoing potential for
substantial expense.

     Lottery contracts also generally require GTECH to post a performance bond,
which in some cases may be substantial, to secure its performance under such
contracts. GTECH paid or incurred liquidated damages with respect to its
contracts equaling 0.47%, 0.14%, 0.47%, 0.56% and 0.35% of its annual revenues
in fiscal 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. If GTECH incurs
substantial liquidated damages in the future, it could significantly reduce the
amount of funds that GTECH has available for other uses in its business and may
delay or prevent GTECH from pursuing and achieving its growth strategy, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition,
results and prospects.

     GTECH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR TO SATISFY
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY DEMANDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  Most of GTECH's software and
hardware products are based on proprietary technologies. Although GTECH believes
that certain of its technologies, such as its Enterprise Series(TM)
open-architecture software platform, provides an industry standard, if it were
to fail to develop its product and service offerings to take advantage of
technological developments, it may fall behind its competitors and its business,
financial condition, results and prospects could suffer.

     EXPANSION OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY FACES OPPOSITION.  Gaming opponents
continue to persist in efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming.
GTECH can give no assurance that this opposition will not succeed in preventing
the legalization of online gaming in jurisdictions where these activities are
presently prohibited or prohibiting or limiting the expansion of online gaming
where it is currently permitted, in either case to the detriment of GTECH's
business, financial condition, results and prospects.

     GTECH'S BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SUCCESS DEPEND UPON ITS ABILITY TO
ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.  GTECH's business prospects and future
success depend, in part, upon its ability to attract and to retain qualified
managerial, marketing and technical employees. Competition for such employees is
sometimes intense, and GTECH may not succeed in hiring and retaining the
executives and other employees that it needs. GTECH's loss of or inability to
hire key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results and prospects.

     GTECH'S BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SUCCESS RELY HEAVILY UPON THE
INTEGRITY OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND THE SECURITY OF ITS SYSTEMS.  The real and
perceived integrity and security of a lottery is critical to its ability to
attract players. GTECH strives to set exacting standards of personal integrity
for its employees and system security for the system that it provides to its
customers, and its reputation in this regard is an important factor in its
business dealings with lottery and other governmental agencies. For this reason,
an allegation or a finding of improper conduct on GTECH's part, or on the part
of one or more of its employees that is attributable to GTECH, or an actual or
alleged system security defect or failure attributable to GTECH, could have a
material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition, results and
prospects, including its ability to retain existing contracts or obtain new or
renewal contracts.

     GTECH'S NON-LOTTERY VENTURES MAY FAIL.  GTECH's business prospects and
future success depend, in part, on its ability to expand its transaction
processing services into complementary and parallel markets outside its core
lottery market. Because GTECH has less experience in non-lottery markets than it
has in its core lottery market, GTECH's non-lottery ventures present an enhanced
element of risk for it. The failure of one or more of its non-lottery ventures
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition,
results and prospects.

     GTECH MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADVERSE DETERMINATIONS IN PENDING LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.  At present GTECH is a party to a securities class action lawsuit
filed against it and some of its current and former officers and directors and
to other legal proceedings which are described more fully in the SEC filings
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. GTECH may not
prevail in any of those legal proceedings. If GTECH is not successful in
defending these legal proceedings, it could incur substantial monetary judgments
or penalties or damage to its reputation, and whether or not GTECH is
successful, the proceedings may occupy the time and attention of its senior
management.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection
with the solicitation of proxies by the Interlott Board of Directors in
connection with the proposed merger and the amended and restated Interlott 1994
Stock Incentive Plan.

     This proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to Interlott
stockholders on or about [ -- ], 2003.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

     Interlott will hold the special meeting on [ -- ], [ -- ], 2003, at 9:00
a.m., local time, at [ADDRESS].

PURPOSE OF SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting you will be asked to vote upon a proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, to vote upon a proposal to approve the Interlott 1994
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective January 15, 2003, and to
transact any other business that properly comes before the special meeting or
any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Following the
recommendation of a special committee of the Board of Directors appointed to
evaluate the fairness of the proposed merger from the point of view of
Interlott's unaffiliated public stockholders, the Interlott Board of Directors
has unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and in the best interests of Interlott stockholders. The Interlott
Board of Directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously
recommends that Interlott stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger
agreement and "FOR" approval of the amended and restated Interlott 1994 Stock
Incentive Plan.

RECORD DATE; STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of Interlott common stock at the close of business
on [--], 2003, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
special meeting. On the record date, [--] shares of Interlott common stock were
issued and outstanding and held by approximately [--] holders of record. A
quorum will be present at the special meeting if a majority of the shares of
Interlott common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting are represented at the special meeting in person or by a
properly executed proxy. Interlott expects a quorum to be present because of the
agreement of Mr. Wells to vote his shares at the meeting. However, if a quorum
is not present at the special meeting, Interlott expects that the meeting will
be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record of
Interlott common stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share on
both proposals that will be presented at the special meeting.

PROXIES; REVOCATION; SOLICITATION

     If you vote your shares of Interlott common stock by signing and dating a
proxy, your shares, unless your proxy is revoked, will be voted at the special
meeting as you indicate on your proxy card. If no instructions are indicated on
your signed and returned proxy card, your shares of Interlott common stock will
be voted "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and "FOR" approval of the
amended and restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan. If your shares are
held in street name, you should follow the directions provided by your broker or
bank regarding how to instruct your broker or bank to vote your shares. If an
executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding shares which
indicates that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement or approval of the amended and restated
Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, known as a broker non-vote, the shares will
be considered present at the special meeting for determining the presence of a
quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement or approval of the amended and restated Interlott 1994
Stock Incentive Plan. The inspector of election appointed for the special
meeting will tabulate all votes and will

separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker
non-votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes
"AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement.

     Abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the amended and
restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan; broker non-votes will have no
effect on the vote to approve that plan.

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the special
meeting by submitting a written revocation to the Secretary of Interlott at 7697
Innovation Way, Mason, Ohio 45040, or by submitting a new proxy to such address,
in either case, dated after the date of the proxy that is being revoked. In
addition, a proxy may also be revoked by voting in person at the special
meeting. Simply attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke
your proxy.

     The Interlott Board of Directors is not currently aware of any other
business to be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly brought before the special meeting (including a proposal for an
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting), the individuals appointed
as proxies will have discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by
duly executed proxies in accordance with their discretion and judgment.

     The solicitation of proxies will occur primarily by mail but may include
telephone or oral communications by regular employees of Interlott, acting
without special compensation. Interlott also will request that persons and
entities holding shares that are registered in their own names or in the names
of their nominees but that are beneficially owned by others send proxy materials
to, and obtain proxies from, those beneficial owners. All expenses involved in
the solicitation of proxies will be paid by Interlott and will include
reimbursement of brokerage firms and others for expenses in forwarding proxy
solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares of Interlott common
stock.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of
Interlott common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is necessary for
the adoption of the merger agreement.

     As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Interlott
beneficially owned, in the aggregate, [--] shares of Interlott common stock, or
approximately [--]% of the shares of Interlott common stock outstanding on that
date. L. Rogers Wells, Jr., the Chairman and majority stockholder of Interlott,
has entered into a stockholder voting and option agreement with GTECH, described
under "The Stockholder Agreement," obligating himself, among other things, to
vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement. Because Mr. Wells beneficially owns
more than 50% of the shares of Interlott common stock outstanding as of the
record date, if Mr. Wells votes to adopt the merger agreement, as required by
the stockholder voting and option agreement, adoption of the merger agreement by
the Interlott stockholders at the special meeting is assured.

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Interlott common stock represented in person or proxy at the special meeting is
required to approve the amended and restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive
Plan. As a result, an abstention on this proposal will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" the proposal. Mr. Wells has advised Interlott that he intends to
vote all of his shares "FOR" this proposal. Accordingly, adoption of this
proposal at the special meeting is assured.

ADJOURNMENTS OR POSTPONEMENTS

     Although it is not expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or
postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. The special meeting
may be adjourned either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a
majority of the shares casting votes. Any signed proxies received by Interlott
will be voted in favor of an adjournment or postponement in these circumstances
unless the shares represented by the proxy are to be voted against the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement. Any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow Interlott
stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time
before they are used.

                                   THE MERGER

     THE DISCUSSION IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS OF THE MERGER AND THE
MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX A AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In August 2000, W. Bruce Turner, at the time GTECH's Chairman and Acting
Chief Executive Officer, and Donald R. Sweitzer, GTECH's Senior Vice President,
met in Rhode Island with L. Rogers Wells, Interlott's majority shareholder and
the Chairman of its Board of Directors, and with Laurance W. Gay, Interlott's
consultant, and discussed a potential transaction between GTECH and Interlott.
Messrs. Turner and Sweitzer determined that, although a transaction might be
worthy of future discussion, GTECH would not pursue any agreement with Interlott
at that time and discussions were broken off.

     On March 28, 2002, David J. Calabro, then GTECH's Executive Vice President
for Global Operations (and since October 2002, GTECH's Chief Operating Officer),
and Mr. Sweitzer traveled to Interlott's headquarters in Mason, Ohio. There they
met with Mr. Wells and David Nichols, Interlott's President and Chief Executive
Officer. A general discussion was held to identify and explore areas in which
the companies might work or fit well together, including product development,
marketing and manufacturing matters, and to discuss the possibility of strategic
alliances, relationships or transactions between the companies generally.
Messrs. Calabro and Sweitzer were given a tour of Interlott's assembly facility
in Mason.

     On June 3, 2002, GTECH and Interlott executed a Mutual Confidentiality
Agreement in anticipation of further general explorations of these matters.

     On June 5, 2002, Mr. Calabro traveled with Mr. Sweitzer to Washington,
D.C., where they met with Messrs. Wells and Nichols at a local restaurant. There
they continued their general discussion concerning possible strategic
transactions between Interlott and GTECH.

     On July 24, 2002, Mr. Calabro met with Messrs. Nichols, Thomas Stokes,
Interlott's Chief Operating Officer, and Dennis Blazer, Interlott's Chief
Financial Officer, in the Red Carpet Club at the Washington Dulles Airport. The
parties generally discussed Interlott's products, its business prospects and
matters relating to its valuation, but no agreements were reached.

     Other than informal discussions at trade conferences where potential for a
relationship was generally mentioned, no further contacts were made until
September 6, 2002, when Mr. Turner had a phone conversation with Mr. Wells in
which Mr. Wells indicated that he would like to discuss further the concept of a
strategic transaction between the companies. Mr. Wells invited Mr. Turner to
visit the factory in Mason and to meet with Interlott's management team. The two
scheduled a visit for November 3 and 4, 2002.

     On September 18, 2002, Mr. Calabro met again with Mr. Nichols at Washington
Dulles airport. During this meeting, they continued their earlier general
dialogue on the possibilities of a strategic transaction.

     On November 3, 2002, Messrs. Turner and Sweitzer traveled to Cincinnati and
had a dinner meeting with Messrs. Wells and Nichols, which included, among other
things, a general discussion of merger possibilities. The next day, November 4,
Messrs. Turner and Sweitzer toured the Interlott manufacturing facility and met
with Interlott's senior management team. A broad discussion was held regarding
the two companies' philosophies and the potential fit between GTECH and
Interlott. The Interlott senior management team presented an enterprise
valuation for Interlott, which the GTECH participants considered to be too high.
The parties did agree, however, that Mr. Blazer would visit Rhode Island to
continue the general valuation discussion with Jaymin B. Patel, GTECH's Chief
Financial Officer. Meetings were scheduled for November 14, 2002.

     On November 14, 2002, Messrs. Blazer and Patel, together with William
Pieri, GTECH's Treasurer, and Keith Bousquet, GTECH's Director of Corporate
Finance, met at GTECH. Discussions focused primarily on cost synergies that
might be possible if the two companies combined.

     On December 3, 2002, Mr. Turner provided GTECH's Board of Directors with
verbal highlights of the ongoing discussions with Interlott at a meeting of the
Board. Thereafter, the Board was mailed a package containing background
financials and SEC reports on Interlott.

     On December 19, 2002, Mr. Turner wrote Mr. Wells a letter outlining a range
of possibilities focusing primarily on the possibility of GTECH purchasing
Interlott, and proposing that the parties enter into a confidentiality and
"no-shop" agreement before proceeding further with any discussions or due
diligence concerning the structure of or valuation associated with any potential
purchase of Interlott.

     On January 6, 2003, Mr. Wells responded with a letter to Mr. Turner, which
included a counterproposal that the parties enter into a strategic alliance
agreement that would advance their mutual business interests in the marketplace,
instead of an acquisition by GTECH at the present time. This proposal also
contemplated a minority equity investment by GTECH in Interlott.

     On January 7, 2003, Mr. Turner called Mr. Wells and rejected his
counterproposal, and indicated that the discussions between the parties should
end because the parties did not appear to have common ground. After further
discussion, in a subsequent conversation Mr. Wells agreed generally that
Interlott would proceed with preliminary due diligence under the process
proposed by GTECH in its December 19, 2002 letter in order to determine whether
a merger transaction was feasible and whether an agreeable valuation for
Interlott could be reached.

     The parties entered into a letter agreement dated January 8, 2003
concerning the formal exploration of the possibility of an acquisition
transaction. Pursuant to this letter agreement, among other things, Interlott
and GTECH each agreed for a limited negotiating period not to discuss a similar
transaction with any third parties and not to acquire or propose to acquire any
stock or assets of the other without such party's prior consent. In addition,
Interlott agreed to provide certain due diligence materials to GTECH and its
representatives, and GTECH agreed to treat such materials as confidential, and
not to communicate with any of Interlott's directors, officers, employees,
vendors or customers without Interlott's express consent.

     On January 14, 2003, GTECH retained Fleet M&A Advisors, a division of Fleet
Securities, Inc., to provide investment banking advisory services including
assisting in the valuation process and providing the GTECH Board of Directors
with an opinion relating to the fairness of any transaction that might be
proposed.

     On January 15, 2003, Interlott's Board of Directors met and was advised
that there had been recent discussions and arrangements made for a due diligence
review of Interlott's records and other information by GTECH, and that GTECH was
exploring the potential for proposing an acquisition transaction involving
Interlott. It was explained to the Board that the structure of any potential
transaction had not yet been determined and that the discussions, as well as the
due diligence process, were confidential. The Board was fully briefed on the
status of discussions and the due diligence process by Mr. Wells and others
present.

     From January 15 to 18, 2003, teams from GTECH, Edwards & Angell, LLP,
GTECH's legal advisor, and Ernst & Young, GTECH's independent auditor, traveled
to Cincinnati and reviewed various Interlott materials at off-site locations as
part of the due diligence process.

     On January 22, 2003, GTECH requested that Edwards & Angell, LLP prepare
agreements, including a merger agreement, pursuant to which GTECH would acquire
Interlott through a merger with a subsidiary of GTECH.

     On January 30, 2003, a patent attorney from Edwards & Angell, LLP traveled
to Cincinnati to conduct due diligence on Interlott's intellectual property. He
met with Mr. Stokes and Edward Turek, Interlott's founder and a member of its
Board of Directors, as well as Interlott's outside counsel and patent counsel,
and discussed Interlott's intellectual property, focusing on its patents.

     On February 5, 2003, Messrs. Turner and Patel traveled to Ohio to visit Mr.
Wells. During a lunch meeting, the group discussed the potential pricing of any
acquisition. GTECH indicated that its offer would be in the range of $8.00 to
$8.50 for an all-cash transaction. Mr. Wells indicated that he was disappointed
in this offer and that he felt that Interlott was worth more. He agreed to
consider the offer.

     On February 17, 2003, Mr. Wells visited Messrs. Turner and Patel at GTECH's
Rhode Island headquarters. The three discussed GTECH's proposal of February 5,
2003 and the possible structure of any acquisition proposal. Mr. Wells proposed
that the transaction be structured so that payment for the Interlott shares
would be made 100% in GTECH stock. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Turner
consulted with Bob Dewey, a member of GTECH's Board of Directors. During the
meeting, Messrs. Turner and Patel agreed that GTECH would increase its
preliminary offer to a range of $8.50 to $9.00 per share in a transaction in
which 50% of the consideration would be paid in cash and 50% would be paid in
GTECH stock. The parties also discussed GTECH's request that Mr. Wells enter
into a five-year non-competition agreement with GTECH. Mr. Wells indicated he
would consider supporting such a transaction subject to the approval of a
special committee and the Interlott Board of Directors.

     From February 17 through March 16, 2003, GTECH's due diligence teams
continued their due diligence, and GTECH's legal and business teams negotiated
terms and conditions of the proposed merger with Interlott's attorneys and
representatives. On February 25, 2003, Edwards & Angell, LLP forwarded a draft
merger agreement to Interlott's counsel, Taft, Stettinius & Hollister LLP. The
parties negotiated the merger agreement, exchanging numerous drafts.

     On February 20, 2003, the Interlott Board of Directors met. The primary
purpose of the meeting was to bring the Interlott Board up to date concerning
the due diligence process and inform the Interlott Board of the GTECH
acquisition proposal. Mr. Wells explained that Interlott had received an
unwritten informal proposal from GTECH to acquire it by merger with a valuation
of $8.50 to $9.00 per share, and that discussions with GTECH had progressed to
the point where it would be appropriate for the Interlott Board to appoint a
special committee to review and advise the Interlott Board concerning the
acquisition proposal. The Interlott Board unanimously adopted resolutions
appointing a special committee of directors consisting of John Wingfield
(chairman), Gary Bell and Jean McEntire in order to (i) examine and evaluate the
terms of the proposal, (ii) consider and decide whether to engage an investment
banking firm and special legal counsel (or other advisors), (iii) advise as
appropriate in connection with the negotiations, (iv) determine whether the
proposal was fair to Interlott's public stockholders, and (v) make a
recommendation to the full Interlott Board and Interlott's public shareholders
regarding the proposal.

     On February 27, 2003, GTECH's Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting
during which GTECH management made a presentation to the GTECH Board regarding
the potential acquisition of Interlott and the status of discussions to date.

     The special committee of the Interlott Board met on February 28, 2003. The
special committee selected Keating, Muething & Klekamp, P.L.L. to act as its
special counsel. At that meeting, the committee's special counsel reviewed with
the committee its assigned tasks and the legal context for the committee's
activities. The committee then began interviewing candidates to act as its
financial advisor. After four candidates made presentations to the committee and
the committee evaluated the presentations, it determined to engage, at the
appropriate time, Houlihan Lokey as its financial advisor.

     The special committee met again on March 7, 2003, and discussed the status
of negotiations with GTECH, the then current draft of the merger agreement and
legal considerations presented by its special counsel. The special committee
confirmed the selection of Houlihan Lokey as its financial advisor and
determined to complete the formal engagement of Houlihan Lokey after agreement
had been reached with GTECH on certain issues in the merger agreement.

     On March 10, 2003, Mr. Wells called Mr. Turner to discuss how Interlott's
debt levels at closing will be considered in relation to the determination of
the price being paid for Interlott's stock. They agreed generally that
Interlott's line of credit could only be drawn for budgeted or agreed upon
amounts and that no adjustment would be made to the purchase price based on the
debt level at closing. The agreed price was fixed at $9.00 per share, subject to
execution of a definitive merger agreement. Also on March 10, 2003,
representatives from Ernst & Young returned to Cincinnati to conduct final
accounting due diligence at an off-site facility. They completed this due
diligence on March 13, 2003.

     On March 11, 2003, Mr. Calabro and Kathy McKeough, GTECH's Senior Vice
President for Human Resources met with Mr. Nichols at the Westin Hotel in
Providence, Rhode Island and discussed entering into a retention agreement with
Mr. Nichols should the merger move forward.

     On March 14, 2003, GTECH's Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting
during which GTECH management made a presentation to the Board regarding the
potential acquisition of Interlott and the status of discussions to date.
Representatives of Edwards & Angell, LLP and Fleet M&A Advisors were present and
made presentations. At the meeting, the GTECH Board of Directors discussed and
approved the final offer for the purchase of Interlott and related matters.

     The special committee of Interlott's Board also met on March 14, 2003. Its
special counsel reviewed conversations with Houlihan Lokey on the status of its
work. The committee then discussed various factors relating to the valuation of
Interlott and counsel reminded and reviewed for the committee factors it was
required to consider under Interlott's certificate of incorporation. The special
committee had a lengthy conversation with representatives of Houlihan Lokey.
Counsel then reviewed with the committee the then current draft of the merger
agreement.

     The special committee met again on March 16, 2003. Representatives of
Houlihan Lokey presented its opinion and report described below. Counsel and the
committee asked Houlihan Lokey for its views as to the termination and break-up
fee and expense reimbursement provisions of the merger agreement. The committee
reviewed in detail the terms of the merger agreement, the voting and option
agreement and the noncompetition agreement. The special committee discussed in
particular the merger consideration allocation provisions, the possible
synergistic affects of the merger on GTECH's stock price, the provisions
entitling Interlott to terminate the merger agreement to accept an unsolicited
superior proposal, the opinion of Houlihan Lokey, the premium represented by the
merger consideration over Interlott's recent stock price, and, in relation to
other considerations, Interlott's strategic alternatives to the merger,
including the desirability of maintaining independence from any other entity,
and the social and economic effects of the merger on Interlott's employees,
customers and suppliers and the communities in which Interlott has a physical
presence.

     After discussion, the special committee unanimously determined that the
terms of the merger documents, including the merger consideration, are fair to,
and in the best interests of, the unaffiliated public stockholders of Interlott
and to recommend that the Interlott Board and stockholders approve and adopt the
merger agreement.

     Later on March 16, 2003, the Interlott Board of Directors met. All
directors were present. The special committee reported on its activities and
presented its recommendations described above. Representatives of Houlihan Lokey
presented its opinion and report described below. Counsel to Interlott reviewed
in detail the provisions of the merger documents. Senior management of Interlott
presented their views on the proposed merger and strategic alternatives. After
discussion, the Interlott Board unanimously determined that the merger was fair
to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of Interlott, to approve the
merger agreement and related transactions and to recommend to the stockholders
of Interlott that they adopt the merger agreement.

     Interlott, GTECH and Bengal Acquisition Co., an indirectly wholly owned
subsidiary of GTECH, then executed the merger agreement. In addition, Mr. Wells,
GTECH and Bengal Acquisition Co. executed the stockholder voting and option
agreement and Mr. Wells and GTECH executed the noncompetition agreement.

     Prior to the commencement of trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange on March 17, 2003, GTECH and Interlott each issued press
releases announcing the execution of the merger agreement and related documents.

GTECH'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and
the related transactions, the GTECH Board of Directors consulted with senior
management and its legal and financial advisors and considered a number of
factors, including the following:

     - the GTECH Board of Directors' familiarity with and review of Interlott's
       business, financial condition and prospects;

     - that the proposed merger is expected to result in significant
       efficiencies from the realignment and integration of certain Interlott
       functions;

     - how the acquisition fits within GTECH's strategy of growing its core
       lottery business;

     - the opportunity to expand GTECH's presence in the instant ticket
       distribution segment;

     - business conditions in the industries in which GTECH and Interlott
       operate;

     - the ability of GTECH to leverage its core competencies in lottery
       automation, logistics optimization, sales and marketing and other
       operational areas, as well as its worldwide sales and government
       relations infrastructure;

     - the expertise of Interlott's current management; and

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

     The above discussion of information and factors considered by GTECH's Board
of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all
material factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by GTECH's Board, the Board did not find it practicable to quantify
or otherwise assign relative weight or rank to any one or more of the specific
factors considered. In addition, the GTECH Board did not reach any specific
conclusion on each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor,
but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the
Board of Directors may have given different weight to different factors.

INTERLOTT'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In reaching their decision to approve the merger and unanimously recommend
that Interlott stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, the Interlott
Board of Directors and its special committee consulted with their financial and
legal advisors and with senior management and considered a number of factors,
including without limitation, the following material factors:

     - the $9.00 merger price as compared to the historic performance of the
       Interlott common stock;

     - historical financial information of Interlott, as well as the information
       presented with respect to Interlott's prospects if it remained
       independent;

     - business conditions in the industries in which Interlott and GTECH
       operate;

     - the reasons for the merger developed and presented by Interlott's
       management;

     - the financial analyses presented by Houlihan Lokey;

     - the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement, including the
       fact that Interlott is permitted to provide information to and negotiate
       with prospective unsolicited purchasers after the execution of the merger
       agreement and the fact that the Interlott Board may terminate the merger
       agreement if it receives a superior proposal;

     - alternatives to the merger, including continuing to operate Interlott as
       an independent company;

     - the possibility that if the merger were not completed, in view of the
       consolidation currently taking place in Interlott's industry, Interlott
       could receive an unsolicited acquisition proposal from another party on
       terms that are not as favorable as those of the merger;

     - the fact that Interlott stockholders may elect (in amounts up to 51.5% of
       the aggregate merger consideration) to receive equity interests in GTECH,
       the combined company after the merger, and in so doing would be able to
       share in the combined companies' growth;

     - their belief that the merger price is greater than the amount that an
       Interlott stockholder would be able to obtain in the open market in the
       immediate future if the merger were rejected;

     - in the case of Interlott's Board, the recommendations and considerations
       of the special committee;

     - the opinion of Houlihan Lokey, described below, as to the fairness, from
       a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Interlott's
       unaffiliated public stockholders; and

     - the tax deferred nature of the merger to Interlott stockholders who
       receive GTECH common shares.

     The Board and special committee also noted that, under Article Tenth of
Interlott's Certificate of Incorporation, in the exercise of their business
judgment in evaluating the merger, they were required to give due consideration
to the social and economic effects of the merger on Interlott's employees,
customers and suppliers and other communities in which Interlott operates, as
well as the economic terms of the merger and the desirability of maintaining
Interlott as an independent entity. In that connection, they noted that GTECH
had indicated that it intended to continue the lease of Interlott's facilities
and that, under the merger agreement, GTECH had agreed to continue Interlott's
current employee benefit plans (or plans no less favorable) for at least one
year.

     Interlott's Board also identified and considered some potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the termination
fee and expenses payable to GTECH if Interlott terminates the merger agreement
under certain circumstances.

     This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Interlott
Board and special committee in making their decision to approve the merger and
the merger agreement and to recommend that Interlott stockholders vote to adopt
the merger agreement is not intended to be exhaustive, but it is believed to
include all material factors considered by the Interlott Board and special
committee. In view of the variety of material factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the merger, both positive and negative, the Interlott
Board and special committee did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the
Interlott Board and special committee may have given different weight to
different factors. The Interlott Board and special committee considered all
these factors as a whole and believed the factors supported its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger and to recommend to the stockholders
of Interlott that they adopt the merger agreement.

     In reaching their determination that the merger is advisable and in the
best interests of Interlott's stockholders, the Interlott Board and special
committee were aware that the members of the Board and certain executive
officers of Interlott have personal interests in the merger that are or may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other Interlott
stockholders. These interests are described below under "Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger." The decisions of the Interlott Board and special
committee, however, were based upon the factors identified above and not the
interests of those individuals.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE INTERLOTT BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     At the special meeting, the holders of Interlott common stock will be asked
to vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the amended
and restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and to transact any other
business that properly comes before the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting. The Interlott Board of Directors has
unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and fair to Interlott stockholders, and that it is in the best
interests of Interlott stockholders that Interlott completes the merger. The
Interlott Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Interlott stockholders
vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and "FOR" approval of the
amended and restated Interlott 1994 Stock Incentive Plan.

OPINION OF INTERLOTT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The special committee of the Interlott Board retained Houlihan Lokey to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with its
engagement, the special committee requested that Houlihan Lokey render an
opinion to the special committee as to the fairness of the merger, from a
financial point of view, to the unaffiliated public stockholders of Interlott.
At the March 16, 2003 meetings of the special committee and the Interlott Board,
Houlihan Lokey presented its analysis described below and delivered its oral
opinion that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described
in its opinion, the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
unaffiliated public stockholders of Interlott. Houlihan Lokey confirmed its oral
opinion by delivery of a written opinion to the special committee dated March
16, 2003. In addition, the special committee requested and received a
"bring-down" opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The
following is a brief summary and general description of the valuation
methodologies utilized by Houlihan Lokey in preparing its fairness opinion. The
summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses and
procedures applied, the judgments made or the conclusion reached by Houlihan
Lokey or a complete description of its presentation. Houlihan Lokey believes,
and so advised the special committee, that its analyses must be considered as a
whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered
by it, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete
view of the process underlying its analyses and opinions.

     THE COMPLETE TEXT OF HOULIHAN LOKEY'S OPINION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX
C. THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE OPINION. THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION
CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, THE
FACTORS CONSIDERED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY HOULIHAN LOKEY.

     Houlihan Lokey's opinion to the special committee addresses only fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Interlott's
unaffiliated public stockholders, and does not constitute a recommendation to
Interlott's common stockholders as to whether they should vote for or against
the merger. Additionally, the opinion does not address the tax consequences to
stockholders. Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey's opinion does not address Interlott's
underlying business decision to effect the merger. Houlihan Lokey has not been
requested to, and did not, solicit third party indications of interest in
acquiring all or any part of Interlott. The consideration in the merger was
arrived at by negotiation between Interlott and GTECH.

     In connection with the preparation of its opinion, Houlihan Lokey made such
reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, Houlihan Lokey:

     - reviewed Interlott's annual reports to stockholders on Form 10-K for the
       fiscal years ended 1998 through 2001; its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
       for the three quarters ended September 30, 2002; and a preliminary draft
       of its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2002;

     - reviewed Interlott's forecasted income statements for the fiscal years
       2003 and 2004 as prepared by Interlott's management;

     - reviewed GTECH's annual reports to shareholders and on Form 10-K for the
       fiscal years ended 1998 through 2001 and quarterly reports on Form l0-Q
       for the three quarters ended October 31, 2002;

     - reviewed copies of the following agreements: Draft Agreement and Plan of
       Merger among GTECH, Bengal Acquisition Co. and Interlott dated March 12,
       2003; Draft Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement dated March 12, 2003;
       and Draft Noncompetition Agreement dated March 12, 2003;

     - met with certain members of senior management of Interlott to discuss
       Interlott's operations and financial condition;

     - met with certain members of senior management of GTECH, via
       teleconference, to discuss its operations, strategy, expectations and
       acquisition rationale;

     - visited the business offices of Interlott;

     - reviewed a presentation by the CEO and CFO of GTECH dated March 2003;

     - reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for Interlott's
       and GTECH's publicly traded securities;

     - reviewed certain other publicly available financial data for certain
       companies that Houlihan Lokey deemed comparable to Interlott, including
       prices and premiums paid in other mergers that Houlihan Lokey considered
       similar to the merger; and

     - conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as Houlihan Lokey
       deemed appropriate.

     In preparing its opinion, Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, that the financial forecasts and projections provided
to it had been reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available
estimates of the future financial results and condition of Interlott and GTECH,
and that there had been no material change in the assets, financial condition,
business or prospects of Interlott and GTECH since the date of the most recent
financial statements made available to it. Houlihan Lokey also noted that the
agreement and plan of merger includes a fiduciary out provision for the
Interlott Board of Directors, and that the stock consideration received will be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and thus will be unrestricted,
except for those shares subject to resale restrictions imposed on affiliates
under Rule 145 of the Securities Act.

     In assessing the financial fairness of the merger, Houlihan Lokey:

     - used widely accepted valuation methodologies to perform an independent
       analysis of the enterprise value and equity value of Interlott;

     - analyzed the terms of the merger; and

     - examined the potential post-merger value to public equity holders.

  VALUATION OF INTERLOTT

     Houlihan Lokey used several methodologies to assess the fairness of the
consideration per share to be received in the proposed merger. The following is
a summary of the material financial analyses used by Houlihan Lokey in
connection with providing its opinion. Houlihan Lokey performed the following
analyses in order to assess the fairness of the consideration to be received by
the unaffiliated public stockholders.

     Market Multiple Method:  Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain financial
information for a number of publicly traded companies that were similar to
Interlott in terms of operations, product mix, and dependence on the gaming
industry for a substantial portion of revenues. Houlihan Lokey selected the
following as comparable companies to Interlott:

  Tier I

     - GTECH Holdings Corporation;

     - Scientific Games Corporation;

  Tier II

     - Alliance Gaming Corporation;

     - International Game Technology;

     - Multimedia Games, Inc.;

     - Shuffle Master, Inc.; and

     - WMS Industries, Inc.

     Houlihan Lokey considered the Tier I companies to be the most comparable to
Interlott. Interlott provides lottery vending machines to states and
international public entities to dispense instant winner lottery tickets. These
companies have customer contracts similar to those of Interlott, which typically
allow the state or other public entity to terminate the contract for any reason
upon 30 days written notice, resulting in significant risk to Interlott. In
contrast, the Tier II comparable companies primarily provide supplies and
services to casinos on customary commercial terms.

     Houlihan Lokey calculated certain financial ratios of the comparable
companies based on the most recent publicly available information and
Interlott's forecasted financial information, including the multiples of: (1)
enterprise value ("EV") to latest twelve months ("LTM") and next fiscal year
("NFY") earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA"), and (2) market value of equity ("Price") to LTM and NFY net income
("NI") of the comparable companies based on the most recent publicly available
information.

     The analysis showed that the multiples exhibited by the Tier I comparable
companies were as follows:

MULTIPLE                                                      MEDIAN   HIGH    LOW
- --------                                                      ------   -----   ----

EV to LTM EBITDA............................................   5.9x     6.3x   5.4x
Price to LTM NI.............................................  10.5x    13.0x   7.9x
EV to NFY EBITDA............................................   5.3x     5.3x   5.3x
Price to NFY NI.............................................   9.3x    12.lx   6.4x

     Houlihan Lokey derived indications of Interlott's enterprise value by
applying selected EBITDA and NI multiples to certain adjusted operating results
of Interlott for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the projected operating
results for the year ending December 31, 2003. Based on the above, and applying
a control premium of 20.0%, the resulting indications of Interlott's EV ranged
from approximately $77.7 million to $87.3 million.

     Comparable Merger Method:  Houlihan Lokey reviewed the consideration paid
in five acquisitions of controlling interests that occurred between January 1,
1998 and March 13, 2003, for companies in the gambling equipment sector.
Houlihan Lokey also reviewed several mergers in the gaming supplies and services
sector, which it did not consider sufficiently comparable to utilize in
connection with its analysis. The five mergers it did consider consisted of the
following:

SELLER                                            BUYER
- ------                                            -----

Anchor Gaming...................................  International Game Technology
Silicon Gaming, Inc. ...........................  International Game Technology
Scientific Games Holdings Corporation...........  Autotote Corporation
Powerhouse Technologies, Inc. ..................  Anchor Gaming
Progressive Games, Inc. ........................  Mikohn Gaming Corporation

     Houlihan Lokey's analysis showed that the multiples exhibited in these
change of control mergers were as follows:

MULTIPLE                                                      MEDIAN   HIGH   LOW
- --------                                                      ------   ----   ----

EV to LTM EBITDA............................................   7.2x    8.7x   6.3x

     In performing its analysis, Houlihan Lokey considered that the merger and
acquisition environment varies over time because of, among other things,
interest rates and equity market fluctuations, industry results and growth
expectations.

     Houlihan Lokey derived enterprise value indications for Interlott by
applying a selected EBITDA multiple range to Interlott's adjusted EBITDA results
for the year ended December 31, 2002. Based on the above, the resulting
indications of Interlott's EV ranged from approximately $81.2 million to $88.6
million.

     After determining our EV from these two methods, Houlihan Lokey made
certain adjustments to determine equity value, including adjustments to reflect
(1) current holdings of cash and cash equivalents,

(2) non-operating assets, and (3) debt obligations. After consideration of such
adjustments, Houlihan Lokey estimated Interlott's equity value, using the two
approaches, to be in the range of $58.7 million to $67.3 million, or $8.78 per
share to $10.05 per share, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis.

  ASSESSMENT OF GTECH'S PUBLIC STOCK PRICE

     In assessing the financial fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated
public stockholders, Houlihan Lokey considered the trading history of GTECH's
public securities and evaluated the trading multiples of GTECH relative to
comparable companies in the market.

     As part of its analysis, Houlihan Lokey analyzed the trading value and
volume of GTECH's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. During the
previous month, GTECH's common stock traded between a low of $26.53 and a high
of $30.63.

     As part of this analysis, Houlihan Lokey observed that:

     - GTECH generally has reasonable trading volume with an average daily
       volume of 700,000 shares, which is similar to comparable companies; and

     - GTECH's common equity securities trade within the range of comparable
       companies' earnings multiples.

     Given this information, Houlihan Lokey concluded that the current stock
price appears reasonable.

     Houlihan Lokey did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness
of the information supplied to it with respect to Interlott and GTECH and does
not assume any responsibility with respect to it. Houlihan Lokey did not make
any independent appraisal of any of the properties or assets of Interlott or
GTECH. Houlihan Lokey's opinion was necessarily based on business, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated by them at
the date of the opinion letter.

     Houlihan Lokey's opinion was furnished solely for the use and benefit of
the special committee in its evaluation of the merger and may not be relied upon
by any other person without the prior written consent of Houlihan Lokey.

     Houlihan Lokey is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with
special expertise in, among other things, valuing businesses and securities and
rendering fairness opinions. Houlihan Lokey is continually engaged in the
valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, private placements of debt and equity,
corporate reorganizations, employee stock ownership plans, corporate and other
purposes. The special committee selected Houlihan Lokey because of its gaming
industry experience and expertise in mergers and acquisitions and in performing
valuation and fairness analyses. Houlihan Lokey does not beneficially own nor
has it ever beneficially owned any interest in Interlott or GTECH.

  FEES AND EXPENSES

     Pursuant to an agreement dated March 11, 2003, Houlihan Lokey was retained
by the special committee and Interlott has agreed to pay Houlihan Lokey a fee of
$225,000 plus its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the rendering of the fairness opinion. Additionally, if at the request of the
special committee Houlihan Lokey renders a "bring-down" opinion within 45 days
of the opinion, Interlott will pay Houlihan Lokey an additional fee of $30,000.
If at the request of the special committee Houlihan Lokey renders a "bring-down"
opinion between 46 days and 90 days of the opinion, Interlott will pay Houlihan
Lokey an additional fee of $45,000. Interlott has further agreed to indemnify
Houlihan Lokey against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with the
rendering of its services. No portion of the fee is contingent upon the
consummation of the merger or the conclusions reached in Houlihan Lokey's
opinion.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Interlott Board that Interlott
stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Interlott stockholders should be aware
that several directors and executive officers of Interlott have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Interlott
stockholders generally. The Interlott Board was aware of and considered these
interests when it considered and approved the merger agreement.

  STOCK OPTIONS

     The members of Interlott's Board and Interlott's executive officers are
participants in Interlott's stock option plans under which vesting is
accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events, including the merger.

     Under the Interlott stock option plans, all outstanding options to purchase
Interlott common stock, including those held by executive officers and directors
of Interlott, will vest in connection with the merger. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, all such options will be cancelled at the effective time of
the merger and the holders will receive cash payments in an amount per share
subject to those options equal to the excess of $9.00 over the exercise price.

     The following table sets forth, as of April 23, 2003, the number of shares
of Interlott common stock subject to options (both vested and unvested) held by
Interlott's directors and executive officers, the weighted average exercise
prices of those options and the amount of the cash payments to be received by
them on cancellation of their options (calculated on the basis of such weighted
average, which may differ immaterially from actual payments under individual
options):

  EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS

     - L. Rogers Wells, Jr. Noncompetition Agreement. When it signed the merger
       agreement, GTECH also entered into a noncompetition agreement with Mr.
       Wells. In exchange for Mr. Wells' agreement not to compete in any fashion
       with GTECH by engaging or proposing to engage in any lottery business for
       a period of five years, GTECH has agreed to pay Mr. Wells $250,000 per
       year for each of those five years.

     - David Nichols -- Effective January 1, 2001, Interlott entered into an
       employment agreement with Mr. Nichols for an initial five-year term.
       Beginning on the fourth anniversary of the agreement and on each
       subsequent anniversary, the term of the agreement will be extended for an
       additional year if neither party gives written notice to the contrary.
       The agreement provides for a minimum annual base salary of $220,000, for
       cost-of-living increases and for annual consideration for performance
       increases. Under the agreement, Mr. Nichols is entitled to a bonus of
       2 1/2% of Interlott's net after tax income plus 5% of any year-over-year
       after tax net income growth. If Interlott terminates the agreement for
       any reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement), disability
       or death, it will pay Mr. Nichols the greater of (1) two times the sum of
       his then-current base salary plus the amount of his immediately preceding
       bonus or (2) his then-current base salary plus the immediately preceding
       bonus for each year remaining in the then-current term of the agreement.
       Interlott also will provide Mr. Nichols with continued health and life
       insurance benefits through the end of the then-current term of the
       agreement and will pay him the value of any forfeited or lost pension,
       profit sharing and similar benefits which would have accrued and vested
       had he remained employed until that time. Similar benefits are payable if
       Mr. Nichols resigns within 90 days after a change of control of Interlott
       or if his employment is actually or constructively terminated within two
       years after a change of control; in such an event, Mr. Nichols also is
       entitled to a gross-up for any taxes imposed as a result of the "excess
       parachute payments" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The merger
       will be a change of control for purposes of Mr. Nichol's employment
       agreement.

       Mr. Nichols and GTECH Corporation have entered into a letter agreement
       dated March 21, 2003, pursuant to which, upon the closing of the merger,
       Mr. Nichol's employment agreement with Interlott described above will
       terminate without further payment and Mr. Nichols will become president
       and chief executive officer of the Interlott subsidiary of GTECH and a
       vice president of GTECH Corporation. The letter agreement provides for a
       starting annual salary of $250,000, a sign on bonus of $500,000, payable
       $200,000 on the first anniversary of the closing of the merger and
       $300,000 on the second anniversary, participation in GTECH Corporation's
       Management Incentive Plan, Merit Increase Program and other employee
       benefit plans, and initial grants of options for 25,000 GTECH common
       shares (vesting in four equal annual installments) and 5,000 units of
       restricted stock (vesting in four equal annual installments). The letter
       agreement provides that Mr. Nichols will be an "at-will"

       employee and his employment may be terminated at any time by him or GTECH
       Corporation without liability.

     - Retention Bonuses. The Interlott Board of Directors authorized Mr.
       Nichols, as chief executive officer, to pay retention bonuses to each of
       the executive officers of Interlott listed below in an amount up to the
       amount shown opposite his name if the officer remains employed by
       Interlott through the closing of the merger and if an employment
       arrangement with the officer that is satisfactory to Mr. Nichols
       addressing employment with GTECH after the merger has not been entered
       into on or before the closing of the merger.

  INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement provides that the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the surviving corporation must contain provisions with respect to
indemnification similar in all material respects to those in Interlott's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and that these provisions may not be
amended for six years.

     The merger agreement also provides that for six years after the merger,
GTECH will cause the surviving corporation to maintain directors' and officers'
liability insurance on terms no less favorable than those in effect as of the
date of the merger agreement. GTECH's obligation to provide this insurance
coverage is subject to a cap of 250% of the premiums paid by Interlott for its
existing insurance coverage in its current fiscal year. If GTECH cannot maintain
the existing or equivalent coverage without exceeding the 250% cap, GTECH is
required to maintain only that amount of insurance coverage that can be obtained
by paying an annual premium equal to the 250% cap.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     GTECH intends to treat the merger as a purchase for accounting and
financial reporting purposes, which means that Interlott will be treated as a
separate entity for periods prior to the completion of the merger and,
thereafter, as a wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH. The purchase price will be
allocated to Interlott's assets, including intangible assets, and liabilities
based on their estimated fair market values at the completion of the merger. Any
excess of the purchase price over these fair market values will be accounted for
as goodwill.

FORM OF THE MERGER

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in
accordance with Delaware law, upon completion of the merger, Interlott will be
merged with and into GTECH Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH
Holdings Corporation. GTECH Corporation will be the surviving corporation in the
merger and will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law. Promptly
following the merger, the assets and liabilities of the Interlott business will
be transferred to a new, wholly owned subsidiary of GTECH Corporation, so that
the Interlott business thereafter will be conducted by an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of GTECH.

EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER

     The merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of
merger by GTECH and Interlott with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such later time agreed upon by GTECH and Interlott and specified in
the certificate of merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will occur as
soon as practicable following the closing of the merger.

CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of Interlott common stock, except
for treasury stock and stock held by GTECH or its subsidiaries or Interlott
stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, will be converted into the
right to receive, at the election of the stockholder (but subject to the
adjustment mechanism described below), one of the following:

     - $9.00 in cash; or

     - a number of GTECH common shares equal to the "exchange ratio."

     The GTECH common shares received by stockholders of Interlott in the merger
will be issued out of its treasury stock, and will not be newly issued shares.
The "exchange ratio" will be equal to $9.00 divided by the average per share
closing price of GTECH common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20
consecutive trading days immediately prior to the third trading day before the
date of the special meeting. The market value of the GTECH common stock on the
date on which the merger is completed and following the merger may be different
than the 20 trading-day average price of GTECH common stock used in determining
the exchange ratio. As a result, the market value of the GTECH common stock you
receive pursuant to the merger, or hold following the merger, may be more or
less than the $9.00 value assumed in calculating the exchange ratio.

     The merger has been structured, and adjustments to Interlott stockholder
elections will be made, so that at the effective time of the merger, 51.5% of
the outstanding shares of Interlott common stock will be converted into the
right to receive GTECH common shares and 48.5% of the outstanding shares of
Interlott common stock will be converted into the right to receive cash. The
proration mechanism is discussed below under "-- Election Procedure; Proration."
The conversion of each share of Interlott common stock (other than treasury
stock and stock held by GTECH or its subsidiaries or those held by stockholders
who perfect their appraisal rights) into the right to receive $9.00 in cash or
GTECH common shares will occur automatically upon completion of the merger. No
fractional GTECH common shares will be issued. Each Interlott stockholder who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a GTECH common share
will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the
fractional share interest times the average of the closing price of GTECH common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the twenty consecutive trading days
immediately before the third the trading day preceding the special meeting. No
voting, distribution or other stockholder rights will attach to any fractional
share interests.

     After the merger, each certificate that previously represented shares of
Interlott common stock will represent only the right to receive the merger
consideration (or, in the case of shares subject to appraisal rights, the right
to receive the amount in cash determined under Delaware law), including cash for
any fractional shares of GTECH common stock. All shares of Interlott common
stock will cease to be outstanding and be canceled by virtue of the merger and
without any action on the part of the holders.

     The form of consideration that you receive will have important tax
consequences for you, as described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
"-- Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

ELECTION PROCEDURE; PRORATION

     The Bank of New York, as exchange agent for GTECH, is mailing you a form of
election in a separate mailing. You should use the form of election to elect
whether to receive cash or GTECH common shares as consideration in connection
with the merger. For an election to be properly made, the form of election must
be received by the exchange agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [ -- ],
2003, which is the fifth business day immediately preceding the special meeting,
and it must be accompanied by the stock certificates for your shares of
Interlott common stock to which your election relates. If your election form is
not received by the deadline, you will be deemed to have elected to receive
whichever form of consideration would permit 51.5% of the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid in GTECH common shares while accommodating as much as
possible the desires of those who submit valid election forms.

     You may revoke a form of election by written notice to the exchange agent
prior to the due date of the election form or after such time if the exchange
agent is legally required to permit revocations and the merger is not yet
effective. If you revoke an election form, the stock certificates to which such
election form relates will be returned promptly. The determination of the
exchange agent is binding as to whether an election has been properly made or
revoked.

     If holders of more than 51.5% of the outstanding shares of Interlott common
stock elect to receive GTECH common shares, the exchange agent will designate,
pro rata among the holders making this election in accordance with the number of
shares of Interlott common stock that they hold, a sufficient number of shares
of Interlott common stock to be converted into $9.00 per share in cash instead
of GTECH common shares so that the number of shares of Interlott common stock
that the holders initially elected to convert into GTECH common shares, less the
number of shares of Interlott common stock so designated to be converted instead
into cash, equals 51.5% of the outstanding shares of Interlott common stock. In
this case, stockholders electing to receive cash and stockholders not making any
election will receive the cash consideration only.

     If holders of less than 51.5% of the outstanding shares of Interlott common
stock elect to receive GTECH common shares, the exchange agent will designate,
first pro rata among the holders who have not made any election, and second, if
necessary, pro rata among the holders making cash elections, in each case in
accordance with the number of shares of Interlott common stock that they hold, a
sufficient number of shares of Interlott common stock to be converted into GTECH
common shares instead of cash so that the number of shares of Interlott common
stock that the holders elected to convert into GTECH common shares plus the
number of shares of Interlott common stock so designated to be converted instead
into GTECH common shares equals 51.5% of the outstanding shares of Interlott
common stock. In this case, stockholders electing to receive shares will receive
the share consideration only.

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

     If your shares are held in registered form and you make an election of
consideration by returning a completed election form, you must send in your
Interlott common stock certificates with your completed election form. If you do
not make an election, then you must keep your stock certificates until after the
closing, when you will receive a letter of transmittal describing how you may
exchange your certificates for merger consideration. Upon surrender to the
exchange agent of a stock certificate for cancellation, together with a letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
reasonably required by the exchange agent, you will receive, following the
effective time of the merger, that number of GTECH common shares and/or cash
that you are entitled to receive in connection with the merger.

     YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD.

     You will not be paid the merger consideration or any dividends or
distributions on the GTECH common shares which you are entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger with a record date after the merger, and will not be paid
cash for any fractional GTECH common shares, until your certificates for
Interlott common stock are surrendered to the exchange agent for exchange. When
your certificates are surrendered, any unpaid dividends and any cash instead of
fractional shares will be paid without interest.

     In the event of a transfer of ownership of Interlott common stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of Interlott, the cash portion of the
merger consideration, including any cash payable instead of fractional shares,
may be paid, and a certificate representing the proper number of GTECH common
shares may be issued, to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered certificate is registered if:

     - the surrendered certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in
       proper form for transfer; and

     - the person requesting such payment and issuance pays any transfer or
       other taxes required by reason of the payment of cash and the issuance of
       GTECH common shares to a person other than the registered holder of the
       surrendered certificate, or establishes to the satisfaction of GTECH that
       such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING OF GTECH COMMON STOCK

     It is a condition to the completion of the merger that GTECH common stock
issuable to Interlott stockholders pursuant to the merger be approved for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF INTERLOTT COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, Interlott common stock will be delisted from
the American Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

  TAX CONSEQUENCES TO GTECH AND INTERLOTT

     The merger is structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If it so
qualifies, neither GTECH nor Interlott will recognize any gain or loss as a
result of the merger. Interlott will have received a legal opinion from Taft,
Stettinius & Hollister LLP, counsel to Interlott, that the merger will
constitute a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, that each of
Interlott and GTECH will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code and that no gain or loss will be recognized by
stockholders of Interlott who receive solely GTECH common shares in the merger,
except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. GTECH will have received
a legal opinion from Edwards & Angell, LLP, counsel to GTECH, that the merger
will constitute a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and that
each of Interlott and GTECH will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Opinions of counsel are not binding upon
the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. No rulings have been sought from the
IRS in connection with the merger. The opinions of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister
LLP and Edwards & Angell, LLP will rely on specific assumptions that customarily
are made in transactions of this kind. The opinions also will rely on
representations and covenants, including those contained in officers'
certificates of GTECH and Interlott.

  TAX CONSEQUENCES TO INTERLOTT STOCKHOLDERS

     This description assumes that the merger will be treated as a tax-free
reorganization. It generally applies to Interlott stockholders who are U.S.
persons and who hold their Interlott shares as a capital asset for federal
income tax purposes. The description does not address all the tax consequences
that may be relevant to Interlott stockholders in light of their particular tax
circumstances or to stockholders who may be subject to special tax treatment
(including, without limitation, stockholders related to other stockholders who
make different elections with respect to the consideration they receive in the
merger; stockholders who hold Interlott common stock as part of a straddle,
hedge, conversion or other risk reduction transaction; broker-dealers;
stockholders who are subject to alternative minimum tax; stockholders who have a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; tax-exempt stockholders; foreign
persons; or those stockholders who acquired Interlott common shares pursuant to
the exercise of compensatory stock options or otherwise as compensation). Such
stockholders with special particular tax circumstances or who are subject to
special tax treatment are strongly urged to consult with their tax advisors
regarding their individual tax consequences. This description is based on the
Code, the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial
authority and current administrative rulings and practices as in effect on the
date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive
effect) and to differing interpretations. Furthermore, no foreign, state or
local tax consequences of the merger are discussed in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

  Stockholders Who Receive Only Cash

     Character of Gain/Loss.  Interlott stockholders who receive only cash in
exchange for their Interlott common stock will generally recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the federal
income tax basis of their Interlott common stock surrendered in the merger. The
gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the Interlott common
stock surrendered in the merger were held as capital assets for a period
exceeding one year as of the time of the exchange. It is possible that with
respect

to Interlott stockholders who are related to other stockholders who have elected
to receive GTECH common shares, the IRS might seek to tax the cash received in
the merger as ordinary income. Such stockholders are urged to consult their tax
advisors.

  Stockholders Who Receive Only GTECH Common Stock (Except for Cash in Lieu of
Fractional Shares)

     No Gain or Loss.  Interlott stockholders who receive only GTECH common
shares in exchange for their Interlott common stock will not recognize any gain
or loss on the exchange, except for gain or loss in connection with cash, if
any, received in lieu of fractional shares. See "Cash in Lieu of Fractional
Shares" below.

     Tax Basis.  The total federal income tax basis of the GTECH common shares
received by an Interlott stockholder will be the same as the total federal
income tax basis of the Interlott common stock surrendered by such stockholder
in the exchange (other than the portion of such basis that is allocated to a
fractional share of GTECH common shares for which cash is received.) See "Cash
in Lieu of Fractional Shares" below.

  Stockholders Who Receive Cash (in Addition to Cash for Fractional Shares) and
GTECH Common Shares

     Gain But Not Loss.  An Interlott stockholder who receives cash and GTECH
common shares will recognize gain in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the
difference between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market value of the GTECH
common shares received in the exchange, and (ii) the stockholder's basis in the
Interlott common stock surrendered in the exchange, and (2) the amount of cash
received by the stockholder (excluding cash in lieu of fractional shares). For
this purpose, an Interlott stockholder must (after ratably allocating cash and
common shares received) calculate gain or loss separately for each identifiable
block of Interlott common shares exchanged by the stockholder in the merger. If
the Interlott common shares exchanged were held as a capital asset for a period
exceeding one year, any gain generally will be treated as a long term capital
gain. Such stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors. An Interlott
stockholder will not be permitted to recognize a loss in the exchange except for
a loss, if any, in connection with cash received in lieu of fractional GTECH
common shares. See "Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares" below.

     Tax Basis.  The total federal income tax basis of the GTECH common shares
received by an Interlott stockholder will be the same as the total federal
income tax basis of the Interlott common stock surrendered in the exchange by
such stockholder (other than that portion of such basis that is allocated to a
fractional share of GTECH common stock for which cash was received -- see "Cash
in Lieu of Fractional Shares" below) decreased by the amount of cash received in
the exchange (excluding cash in lieu of fractional shares), and increased by the
amount of gain, if any, recognized in the exchange (including any portion of the
gain that is treated as a dividend but excluding any gain recognized as a result
of cash received instead of a fractional share). This calculation must be made
separately for each identifiable block of Interlott common stock exchanged.

  HOLDING PERIOD

     The holding period of GTECH common shares received by Interlott
stockholders will include the holding period for the Interlott common stock
surrendered in the exchange, provided that the Interlott common stock was held
as a capital asset on the date of the exchange.

  CASH IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Interlott stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of
GTECH common stock as a result of the merger will be treated for federal income
tax purposes as if the fractional share interest had been issued in the merger
to the stockholders and then had been redeemed by GTECH for cash. The amount of
gain or loss realized by a Interlott stockholder will be equal to the difference
between (1) the amount of cash received in lieu of a fractional share and (2)
the portion of the stockholder's basis in Interlott common stock that is
allocated to the fractional share. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or
loss, and will be long-term capital

gain or loss provided that the Interlott common stock was held as a capital
asset and for a period exceeding one year as of the time of the exchange.

  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

     Interlott stockholders are required to file a statement with their U.S.
federal income tax returns setting forth their tax basis in the Interlott common
shares exchanged in the merger, the fair market value of the GTECH common shares
and the amount of any cash received in the merger. In addition, Interlott
stockholders will be required to retain permanent records relating to these
facts.

  BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     Cash payments made to Interlott stockholders pursuant to the merger may,
under certain circumstances, be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 30%.
There is no withholding for stockholders who provide the exchange agent with
their correct U.S. federal taxpayer identification number and who certify that
no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred on IRS Form W-9 or its
substitute. Certain categories of Interlott stockholders (for example,
corporations and some foreign individuals) are not subject to backup
withholding. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, such individual must generally provide the exchange agent with a
completed IRS Form W-8BEN or its substitute. Any amounts withheld from an
Interlott stockholder under the backup withholding rules are not an additional
tax. Rather, any such amounts will be allowed as a credit or refund against such
stockholder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the stockholder
furnishes to the IRS all required information.

     The discussion of federal income taxes is included in this proxy
statement/prospectus for general information only. EACH INTERLOTT STOCKHOLDER
SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THE STOCKHOLDER OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND
EFFECT OF STATE AND LOCAL INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 and related rules, certain
transactions, including the merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting
period requirements have been satisfied. On April 1, 2003, GTECH and Interlott
each filed a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division and the
Federal Trade Commission and requested an early termination of the required
waiting period. If early termination is not granted and a request for additional
information by the relevant antitrust authorities is not made, the waiting
period will expire at midnight on May 1, 2003. At any time before or after the
completion of the merger, the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission
or others could take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the merger,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger
or to conditionally approve the merger upon the divestiture of substantial
assets of GTECH or Interlott.

     It is possible that any of the governmental entities with which filings are
made may seek various regulatory concessions. There can be no assurance that:

     - GTECH or Interlott will be able to satisfy or comply with such
       conditions, or

     - compliance or non compliance will not have adverse consequences for GTECH
       after completion of the merger.

     See "The Merger Agreement--Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" on
page      .

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS

     GTECH has agreed that, for a period of 12 months beginning on the closing
date, GTECH will maintain for the benefit of employees of Interlott immediately
before the merger the Interlott employee benefit plans as in effect immediately
before the merger or provide benefits that are not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, than the benefits provided to those employees immediately before
the merger.

     Interlott has agreed that it will cause its employee stock purchase plan to
terminate at least five business days before the closing of the merger in
accordance with the terms of that plan as in effect on the date of the merger
agreement. Employees will be permitted to elect to receive invested cash or to
purchase shares in accordance with the terms of the plan.

TREATMENT OF INTERLOTT STOCK OPTIONS

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding stock options will
be cancelled at the effective time of the merger and the holders will receive
cash payments in an amount per share subject to those options equal to the
excess of $9.00 over the exercise price.

RESALE OF GTECH COMMON STOCK

     GTECH common stock issued pursuant to the merger will not be subject to any
restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act of 1933, except for
shares issued to any Interlott stockholder who may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of GTECH or Interlott for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act (including, but not limited to, L. Rogers Wells, Jr.). It is expected that
each such affiliate will agree not to transfer any shares of GTECH common stock
received pursuant to the merger except in compliance with the resale provisions
of Rule 144 or 145 under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the
Securities Act. Any affiliate who fails to enter into such an agreement may not
elect to receive GTECH common shares. This proxy statement/prospectus does not
cover resales of GTECH common shares received by any person upon completion of
the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this proxy
statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     When the merger is completed, Interlott stockholders who have filed a
written demand for appraisal prior to the special meeting, who do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who comply with the other
procedures prescribed in Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware will be entitled to a judicial appraisal of the fair value of their
shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of the fair value of their
shares in cash, together with a judicially determined fair rate of interest. The
following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures that must be followed
by a Interlott stockholder in order to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware
law.

     THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS NOT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE DELAWARE LAW
PERTAINING TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE FULL TEXT
OF SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WHICH IS
ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX D. BECAUSE OF THE
COMPLEXITY OF SECTION 262 AND THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH VARIOUS TECHNICAL
REQUIREMENTS, YOU SHOULD READ ANNEX D IN ITS ENTIRETY. A PERSON HAVING A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF INTERLOTT COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE
NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER OR NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE
THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE STEPS SUMMARIZED BELOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     Under Section 262, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, Interlott
must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that such
appraisal rights are available and include in such notice a copy of Section 262.
THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS CONSTITUTES SUCH NOTICE.

     A holder of shares of Interlott common stock wishing to exercise appraisal
rights:

     - must deliver to Interlott, before the vote on the adoption of the merger
       agreement at the special meeting being held on [ -- ], 2003, a written
       demand for the appraisal of his or her shares, and

     - must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

     In order not to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a
stockholder must either:

     - not return a proxy card and not vote in person in favor of the adoption
       of the merger agreement,

     - return a proxy card with the "Against" or "Abstain" box checked,

     - vote in person against the adoption of the merger agreement, or

     - register in person an abstention from the proposal to adopt the merger
       agreement.

     ALL WRITTEN DEMANDS FOR APPRAISAL PURSUANT TO SECTION 262 SHOULD BE SENT OR
DELIVERED TO INTERLOTT AT 7697 INNOVATION WAY, MASON, OHIO 45040, ATTENTION:
SECRETARY.

     A holder of shares of Interlott common stock wishing to exercise appraisal
rights must hold the shares of record on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and through the effective time of the merger. A vote against
the adoption of the merger agreement will not in and of itself constitute a
written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The
demand must reasonably inform Interlott of the identity of the holder as well as
the intention of the holder to demand appraisal of the "fair value" of the
shares held by such holder. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand
prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

     Only a holder of record of shares of Interlott common stock is entitled to
assert appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A
demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Interlott common stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and correctly, as such
holder's name appears on such holder's stock certificates, and must state that
such person intends thereby to demand appraisal of such holder's shares of
Interlott common stock in connection with the merger. If the shares of Interlott
common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of the demand should be made in that capacity,
and if the shares of Interlott common stock are owned of record by more than one
person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including two
or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder
of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and
expressly disclose the fact that in executing the demand, the agent is agent for
such owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker who holds shares of
Interlott common stock as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise
appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Interlott common stock held for
one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to
the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, however, the written
demand should set forth the number of shares of Interlott common stock as to
which appraisal is sought, and where no number of shares of Interlott common
stock is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of
Interlott common stock held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who
hold their shares of Interlott common stock in brokerage accounts or other
nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult
with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

     Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation must notify each holder of Interlott common stock who has complied
with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement of the date that the merger has become effective. Within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or any holder
of Interlott common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of such holder's shares of
Interlott common stock. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and
has no present intention to file such a petition. Accordingly, it is the
obligation of the holders of Interlott common stock to initiate all necessary
action to perfect their appraisal rights.

     Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of
Interlott common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of
appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten days after a
written

request for the statement has been received by the surviving corporation or
within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later.

     If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of
Interlott common stock and a copy of the petition is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached. After notice to such stockholders as required by the court, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing on such petition to determine
those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the holders of shares of
Interlott common stock who demanded payment for their shares to submit their
stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation on the
certificate of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding. If any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     After determining the holders of Interlott common stock entitled to
appraisal, the Court will appraise the "fair value" of their shares of Interlott
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to
be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Holders of Interlott
common stock considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value
of their shares of Interlott common stock as so determined could be more than,
the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the
merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that investment
banking opinions as to fairness from a financial point of view are not
necessarily opinions as to fair value under Section 262. The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that proof of value by any techniques or methods which are
generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court should be considered in the appraisal proceedings. In
addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,
depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter's exclusive
remedy. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also determine the amount of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amounts to be received by persons whose
shares of Interlott common stock have been appraised. The costs of the action
may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the court deems
equitable. The Court also may order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by any stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts
utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of
all the shares entitled to be appraised.

     Any holder of shares of Interlott common stock who has duly demanded an
appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time of
the merger, be entitled to vote the shares for any purpose or be entitled to the
payment of dividends or other distributions on those shares.

     If any stockholder who demands appraisal under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or withdraws or loses, the holder's right to appraisal, the holder's
shares of Interlott common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the
effective time of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration.
A stockholder will fail to perfect, or lose or withdraw, the right to appraisal
if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time
of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a
written withdrawal of such holder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective
time of the merger will require the written approval of the surviving
corporation and, once a petition for appraisal is filed, the appraisal
proceeding may not be dismissed as to any holder absent Court approval.

     FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS QUALIFIED
IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, A
COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX A AND IS
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT ARE SUMMARIZED ABOVE UNDER "THE MERGER." PLEASE READ THE FULL TEXT OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.  Each party's obligation to
complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified
conditions before completion of the merger, including the following:

     - the adoption of the merger agreement by holders of a majority of all
       outstanding shares of Interlott common stock,

     - the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the
       merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,

     - the absence of any restraining order, injunction or other court order or
       other legal restraint or prohibition preventing or delaying completion of
       the merger,

     - the absence of any stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order with
       respect to the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy
       statement/prospectus forms a part, and

     - the GTECH common shares issuable to Interlott stockholders pursuant to
       the merger having been approved for listing on the New York Stock
       Exchange.

     In addition, the obligation of each of GTECH and Interlott to complete the
merger is further subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following
additional conditions:

     - the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the
       merger agreement being true and correct as of the date of the merger
       agreement and as of the closing date,

     - the other party having performed and complied in all material respects
       with all material agreements and covenants required by the merger
       agreement to be performed or complied with by it,

     - receipt from its counsel on the closing date of an opinion as to the tax
       effects of the merger, and

     - no event having occurred which is reasonably likely to have a material
       adverse effect on Interlott or GTECH, respectively.

     In addition, GTECH's obligation to complete the merger is further subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

     - there must not be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any
       governmental entity seeking to restrain or prohibit the completion of the
       merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
       seeking material damages in connection with such transactions, or seeking
       to materially limit the ownership, operation or control by GTECH of
       Interlott,

     - there must not be pending any suit, action or proceeding brought by any
       third party other than a governmental entity seeking to restrain or
       prohibit the completion of the merger or the other transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement or seeking material damages in
       connection with such transactions, or seeking to materially limit the
       ownership, operation or control by GTECH of Interlott, that could
       reasonably be expected to succeed,

     - GTECH must receive evidence that certain consents and approvals required
       in connection with the merger agreement have been obtained by Interlott,

     - the audited financial statements of Interlott for the fiscal year ended
       December 31, 2002, must have been delivered to GTECH and must be
       consistent in all material respects with the financial information
       included in preliminary financial statements previously delivered to
       GTECH, and

     - the number of shares to which dissenters' rights have been demanded and
       perfected under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law must
       not exceed 10% of Interlott's total outstanding shares.

     The merger agreement provides that a "material adverse effect" means, when
used in reference to Interlott or GTECH, any change, effect or event that:

     - is or is reasonably likely to be material and adverse to the condition
       (financial or otherwise), business, properties, assets, liabilities,
       results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the applicable company
       and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or

     - does or is reasonably likely to materially impair the ability of the
       applicable company to perform its obligations under the merger agreement
       or otherwise materially threatens or impedes the completion of the merger
       or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the
       conduct of business by the surviving corporation in the merger.

     NO SOLICITATION.  The merger agreement contains detailed provisions
prohibiting Interlott from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these "no
solicitation" provisions, Interlott has agreed that it will not, and that it
will not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents or affiliates (including any investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors) to, directly or indirectly:

     - initiate, solicit or encourage or take any action to facilitate any
       acquisition proposal, as described below, or any inquiries or the making
       of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
       to an acquisition proposal, or

     - have any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person
       any information with respect to, or agree to endorse, an acquisition
       proposal.

     The term "acquisition proposal" means an inquiry, offer or proposal
regarding any of the following (other than with GTECH) involving Interlott:

     - a merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business
       combination or other similar transaction;

     - a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
       of 25% or more of the assets of Interlott, in a single transaction or in
       a series of transactions,

     - a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of capital stock
       of Interlott or purchase from Interlott of any shares of capital stock of
       Interlott or the filing of a registration statement with the SEC in
       connection with any of these events, or

     - a public announcement by Interlott of a proposal, plan or intention to do
       any of the above or any agreement to engage in any of the above.

     However, the merger agreement does not prevent the Interlott Board of
Directors, at any time prior to obtaining Interlott stockholder approval, from
furnishing information with respect to Interlott pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement to, and participating in discussions or negotiations
with, any person making an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal that
the Interlott Board determines in good faith, after consulting with legal
counsel and its financial advisors, could result in a superior proposal, as
described below, if the Board determines in good faith that to do otherwise is
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the Interlott stockholders.
Interlott must give GTECH one full business day's notice of its intention to
undertake either of these actions.

     The term "superior proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide acquisition
proposal that has the following characteristics:

     - it is a proposal to acquire for cash or readily marketable securities (a)
       at least 80% of the voting power of the Interlott common stock and the
       Interlott common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options,
       warrants and other rights to acquire Interlott common stock, or (b)
       substantially all of the assets of Interlott;

     - the terms of the proposal, in the good faith judgment of the Interlott
       Board, are more favorable to Interlott's stockholders from a financial
       point of view than the merger with GTECH (after taking into account the
       termination fee described below and any changes to the terms of the
       merger agreement offered by GTECH in response to the proposal);

     - the transactions envisioned by the proposal, in the good faith judgment
       of Interlott Board, are reasonably likely to be consummated without
       unreasonable delay or unusual conditions compared to the transactions
       contemplated with GTECH; and

     - any financing required for the proposed transaction has been committed in
       all material respects.

     The merger agreement further provides that neither Interlott's Board nor
any of its committees may:

     - withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to GTECH, or propose to withdraw
       or modify, its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the
       merger,

     - approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any alternative
       acquisition proposal, or

     - enter into any alternative acquisition proposal.

     However, the merger agreement does not prevent Interlott's Board or any of
its committees from taking any of the actions specified in the three bullets of
the previous paragraph prior to the special meeting if the Interlott Board or
committee determines in good faith (after consulting with legal counsel) that
the failure to take any such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Interlott must give written
notice to GTECH that it intends to take such action no later than 12:00 noon on
the business day before it intends to take such action.

     Furthermore, the merger agreement provides that the Interlott Board may, at
any time prior to obtaining Interlott stockholder approval, in response to an
unsolicited superior proposal and subject to the next sentence, cause Interlott
to terminate the merger agreement with GTECH and either withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of the merger or enter into a binding agreement for
that superior proposal. The Interlott Board cannot exercise its termination
right:

     - unless Interlott has paid to GTECH the termination fee as described below
       in "-- Termination Fee" prior to or simultaneously with the termination;
       and

     - until after 24 hours have passed since Interlott notified GTECH that it
       has received a superior proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of
       the proposal and the person or entity that made the superior proposal.

     TERMINATION.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
completion of the merger, even if the merger agreement has been adopted by
Interlott stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent of GTECH and Interlott;

     - by either GTECH or Interlott, if the merger has not been completed by
       September 17, 2003, so long as the party seeking to terminate the
       agreement has not, by failing to fulfill its obligations under the
       agreement, been the cause of the delay;

     - by either GTECH or Interlott, if there exists a final and nonappealable
       restraining order, injunction or other court order or decree or other
       legal restraint or prohibition preventing completion of the merger;

     - by either GTECH or Interlott, if Interlott stockholders do not adopt the
       merger agreement at a duly held stockholders meeting;

     - by either GTECH or Interlott, if the other party has materially breached
       any of its covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement,
       which breach would result in a failure of a condition to the merger and
       cannot or has not been cured within ten business days of notice;

     - by either GTECH of Interlott, if the representations and warranties of
       the other party shall be untrue in a way that would result in a failure
       of a condition to the merger;

     - by GTECH, if Interlott's Board or any of its committees:

      - withdraws, or modifies in a manner adverse to GTECH, its recommendation
        or approval of the merger agreement or the merger, or

      - recommends or approves any alternative acquisition proposal, or

      - if Interlott enters into an agreement with respect to any alternative
        acquisition proposal;

     - by Interlott, at any time prior to obtaining Interlott stockholder
       approval and after compliance with specified provisions of the merger
       agreement, in connection with withdrawing or modifying its approval or
       recommendation or entering into a binding agreement for a superior
       proposal as described above under "-- No Solicitation;"

     - by GTECH, if, three business days before the special meeting of Interlott
       stockholders, the average closing price of GTECH common stock as reported
       on the New York Stock Exchange over the 20 trading days prior to that
       date is less than $25.12; or

     - by GTECH or Interlott if the special committee of Interlott's Board had
       requested but not have received an opinion from its financial advisor
       dated as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus to the effect
       described in "The Merger -- Opinion of Interlott's Financial Advisor."

     Notwithstanding the next to last bullet above, GTECH will not be permitted
to terminate the merger agreement and the merger for the reason that its average
stock price has fallen below the level described in that bullet, if Interlott
notifies GTECH that it wants to proceed with a merger in which the consideration
is paid 100% in cash. If that happens, then the parties have agreed to negotiate
an amendment to the merger agreement to reflect the requirements of an all-cash
transaction. In that event, you will be mailed another proxy statement asking
you to approve the merger as an all-cash transaction and giving further details
as to the consequences of an all-cash transaction.

     TERMINATION FEE.  Interlott must pay to GTECH a termination fee of $2.75
million, together with out-of-pocket expenses up to $750,000, if:

     - either GTECH or Interlott terminates the merger agreement due to
       Interlott's stockholders failing to approve the merger;

     - GTECH terminates the merger agreement because Interlott's Board of
       Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its approval or recommendation
       of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse to GTECH or
       approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal, or Interlott
       enters into an alternative acquisition proposal; or

     - Interlott terminates the merger agreement in connection with its Board
       withdrawing or modifying its approval of the merger agreement or the
       merger or in connection with Interlott entering into a definitive
       agreement for an alternative acquisition proposal.

     EXPENSES.  The merger agreement provides that all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party
incurring those fees or expenses. However, if the merger agreement is terminated
for any reason other than for a breach by GTECH, and Interlott consummates a
transaction concerning a superior proposal within 12 months of the termination,
Interlott will pay GTECH's out-of-pocket expenses, up to $750,000, to the extent
it has not already done so.

     CONDUCT OF INTERLOTT'S BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER.  Under the merger
agreement, Interlott agreed that, during the period before completion of the
merger, it will:

     - carry on its business in the ordinary course consistent with past
       practice, and

     - use all reasonable efforts to preserve intact its current business
       organizations, keep available the services of its current officers and
       employees and preserve its relationship with its customers, suppliers,
       licensors, licensees, distributors and others having material business
       dealings with it.

     In addition, Interlott has agreed that it will not:

     - declare, set aside or pay dividends, or make any other distribution in
       respect of any of its capital stock,

     - adjust, split or reclassify any of its capital stock,

     - repurchase or redeem its capital stock,

     - grant any options, warrants or rights to purchase its securities, or

       common stock as a result of the exercise of existing stock options or
       rights under the employee stock purchase plan,

     - amend its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar
       organizational documents, or create any subsidiaries,

     - adopt or implement a plan of consolidation, merger or reorganization,
       other than in connection with the merger described in this proxy
       statement/prospectus,

     - amend, modify or waive any material term of its common stock or any other
       security,

     - amend any existing agreement, or enter into any new agreement, relating
       to the assumption or incurrence of indebtedness, except that Interlott
       may draw on its existing credit facilities in the ordinary course of
       business so long as the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness
       outstanding under those facilities does not exceed $22 million, or if the
       aggregate principal amount exceeds $22 million, so long as the draws are
       contemplated in its capital budget for year 2003 or otherwise with the
       consent of GTECH, which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld,

     - guarantee any indebtedness or issue or sell any debt securities,

     - pay any pension, retirement allowance or other employee benefit not
       required or contemplated by any existing Interlott employee benefit plan
       in effect at the date of the merger agreement to any director or, other
       than in the ordinary course of business, to any officer or employee,

     - become obligated under any new employee benefit plan which was not in
       existence on the date of the merger agreement, or amend any such plan or

       enhance any benefits under those plans, except as may be required to
       comply with applicable law,

     - grant to any current or former director, officer or employee, any
       increase in severance or termination pay (including the acceleration in

       automatically accelerated by their existing terms or the terms of the
       merger agreement),

     - acquire any assets that are material, in the aggregate, to Interlott,

     AMENDMENT, EXTENSION AND WAIVER.  The merger agreement provides that the

     Under Section 251(d) of the General Corporation Law of the State of

by the stockholders, alter or change the merger consideration to be received by
those stockholders, alter or change any term of the certificate of incorporation
of the surviving corporation, or alter or change any terms and conditions of the
merger agreement if the alteration or change would adversely affect the holders
of any class or series of stock of the corporation.

                           THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT

     In order to induce GTECH to enter into the merger agreement, L. Roger
Wells, Jr. entered into a stockholder voting and option agreement with GTECH and
the GTECH subsidiaries that are a party to the merger agreement dated as of
March 17, 2003. In this stockholder agreement, Mr. Wells has agreed to vote his
shares in favor of the merger. The shares subject to this agreement (including
options that vested within 60 days of March 17, 2003) represented 54.8% of
Interlott's outstanding capital stock at that date. The stockholder agreement
will terminate when the merger becomes effective, or if the merger agreement is
terminated under specified provisions due to any breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant of GTECH or if Interlott's Board of Directors terminates
the merger agreement in connection with a superior acquisition proposal. See
"The Merger Agreement--Termination." It will also terminate 60 days after any
termination of the merger agreement for other reasons, or at the latest,
December 17, 2003.

     In addition, Mr. Wells irrevocably granted GTECH's subsidiary an option,
exercisable only upon certain events set forth in the agreement, to purchase all
of his shares at a purchase price per share equal to $9.00 in cash. Subject to
the conditions in the agreement, GTECH's subsidiary may exercise the option in
whole at any

time prior to the date 60 days after the expiration or termination of the merger
agreement if Mr. Wells fails to comply with any of his obligations under the
stockholder agreement. GTECH may also exercise the option if the merger is not
consummated, and the merger agreement is terminated, because of the failure to
satisfy specified conditions to the merger under the merger agreement. Funds
required to exercise the option would be furnished from the working capital of
GTECH. The stockholder agreement does not restrict Mr. Wells ability to act in
his capacity as a director or officer of Interlott.

     A copy of the stockholder agreement is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B.

                       DESCRIPTION OF GTECH CAPITAL STOCK

     This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the material terms
of the capital stock of GTECH under its amended and restated articles of
incorporation and amended by-laws. The terms of GTECH amended and restated
articles of incorporation and amended by-laws are more detailed than the general
information provided below. You should carefully consider the actual provisions
of these documents. The GTECH amended and restated articles of incorporation and
amended by-laws may be obtained without charge by following the instructions in
the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page      .

     The total authorized capital stock of GTECH consists of:

     - 150 million shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and

     - 20 million shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share.

     On April 3, 2003, there were 56,699,012 shares of GTECH common stock issued
and outstanding, and no shares of GTECH preferred stock issued and outstanding.

     The following is a summary description of the material terms of GTECH's
capital stock and is qualified in its entirety by reference to GTECH's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as amended, filed as exhibits to its
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page      .

     The holders of GTECH common stock are entitled to one vote per share for
each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.
Subject to preferential rights with respect to any series of preferred stock
that may be issued, holders of GTECH common stock are entitled to receive
ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors on common
stock out of funds legally available therefor, and in the event of a
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of GTECH's affairs, are entitled to share
equally and ratably in all of GTECH remaining assets and funds. The holders of
common stock have no preemptive rights, cumulative voting rights, or rights to
convert shares of common stock into any other securities and are not subject to
future calls or assessments by GTECH.

     GTECH's certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide for a classified
board of directors consisting of three classes as nearly equal in size as the
then authorized number of directors constituting the board of directors permits.
At each annual meeting of stockholders, one class of directors is elected for a
three-year term, and the directors in the other two classes continue in office.
Each class holds office until the date of the third annual meeting for the
election of directors following the annual meeting at which such class was
elected. As a result, approximately one-third of the GTECH board of directors is
elected each year. Moreover, under the Delaware General Corporation Law (and
GTECH's certificate of incorporation and by-laws), in the case of a corporation
having a classified board, stockholders may remove a director only for cause.
This provision, when coupled with the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant
directorships, may preclude a stockholder from removing incumbent directors
without cause and simultaneously gaining control of the board of directors by
filling the vacancies created by such removal with that stockholder's own
nominees.

     GTECH's certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law, none of its directors shall be personally liable to
GTECH or to its stockholders for monetary damages for the breach

of fiduciary duties as directors. The effect of this provision is to eliminate
GTECH's rights and the rights of its stockholders (through stockholder
derivative suits on GTECH's behalf) to recover monetary damages against a
director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director (including breaches
resulting from grossly negligent conduct). This provision does not, however,
exonerate the directors from liability under federal securities laws or for (i)
breaches of a director's duty of loyalty to GTECH or its stockholders, (ii) acts
or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
knowing violation of law, (iii) certain willful or negligent acts in connection
with the payment of dividends or the repurchase or redemption of securities, or
(iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit. GTECH's by-laws provide for indemnification of its officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and officers and
directors also may be indemnified pursuant to agreements with GTECH.

     The board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or
more classes or series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and relative
participating, optional or other special rights of such preferred stock without
any further vote or action by GTECH's stockholders. The ability of the board of
directors to issue preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection
with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could adversely affect
the voting power of the holders of GTECH common stock and could have the effect
of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a
third party from acquiring, control of GTECH. GTECH has no present plans to
issue any of the preferred stock.

     Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a
publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination"
with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years following the time
such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time
either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the board of
directors of the corporation, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which
resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owns at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding
at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
number of shares outstanding (A) those shares owned by persons who are both
directors and officers and (B) certain employee stock plans, or (iii) at or
after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors
and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by
written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. A "business
combination" includes certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transfers
and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. An
"interested stockholder" generally is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 15% or more of the
corporation's voting stock.

       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF GTECH AND INTERLOTT

     Interlott and GTECH are both organized under the law of the State of
Delaware. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of Interlott
common stock and GTECH common stock arise primarily from differences between
Interlott's certificate of incorporation and by-laws and GTECH's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and it amended and restated by-laws. Upon
completion of the merger, Interlott stockholders who elect to receive GTECH
stock will exchange all or a portion of their issued and outstanding shares of
Interlott common stock for GTECH common stock, subject to their election between
cash and stock consideration and the proration described above under "The
Merger -- Consideration to be Received in the Merger." Accordingly, upon
consummation of the merger, the rights of Interlott stockholders who become
stockholders of GTECH in the merger will be governed by Delaware law and by
GTECH's certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The following is a summary of
the material differences between the current rights of Interlott stockholders
and the rights of GTECH stockholders.

     The following discussions are not intended to be complete and are qualified
by reference to the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of each company. In
addition, the identification of some of the differences in the rights of these
stockholders as material is not intended to indicate that other differences that
are equally important do not exist. Please read carefully the relevant
provisions of Delaware law, as well as the certificates of incorporation and the
by-laws of each company. Copies of these documents are incorporated by reference

into this document and will be sent to you upon request. See "Where You Can Find
More Information" on page      .

  Board of Directors

     Interlott.  The board of directors of Interlott has seven directors,
divided into three classes, each elected for a three-year term. The Interlott
by-laws provide that the Interlott board of directors will consist of at least
one member and not more than nine members. The number of directors is fixed from
time to time by resolution of the directors or the stockholders of Interlott.

     GTECH.  The board of directors of GTECH has eight directors, divided into
three classes, each elected for a three-year term. The GTECH amended and
restated by-laws provide that the GTECH board of directors will consist of a
number of directors not less than six and not more than twelve. The number of
directors is fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors of
GTECH.

  Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies

     Interlott.  The Interlott certificate of incorporation provides that,
subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock, any vacancies in the board
of directors caused by the resignation, removal, death or other incapacity of a
director elected by the stockholders, and any newly created directorships
resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of the board of
directors, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director;
provided, however, that if the holders of any class of stock or series thereof
are entitled to elect one or more directors, vacancies and newly created
directorships of such class or series may only be filled by a majority vote of
the directors elected by such class or series then in office, whether or not a
quorum.

     GTECH.  The GTECH certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to
any rights of holders of preferred stock, any vacancies in the board of
directors caused the resignation, removal, death or other incapacity of a
director elected by all the stockholders, and any newly created directorships
resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of the board of
directors, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director.

  Evaluation of Change of Control Offers

     Interlott.  Pursuant to the Interlott certificate of incorporation, the
board of directors of Interlott, when evaluating any offer of a person to (a)
make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security of Interlott, (b) merge
or consolidate Interlott with another person, or (c) purchase or otherwise
acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets of Interlott
shall, in connection with the exercise of business judgment in determining the
best interests of Interlott and its stockholders, give due consideration to all
relevant factors including (i) the consideration being offered in relation to
current market price, but also in relation to the current value of Interlott in
a freely negotiated transaction and in relation to the board of directors'
current estimate of the future value of Interlott as an independent entity, (ii)
the social and economic effects on the employees, customers, suppliers and other
communities in which Interlott and its subsidiaries and on the communities in
which Interlott and its subsidiaries operate or are located, and (iii) the
desirability of maintaining independence from any other entity.

     GTECH.  The duties of GTECH directors in evaluating change of control
offers are governed by Delaware law.

  Removal of Directors

     Interlott.  The Interlott certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide
that a director may be removed only for cause by an affirmative vote of the
stockholders holding at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote in an
election of directors, voting together as a single class.

     GTECH.  The GTECH certificate of incorporation provides that a director may
be removed only for cause by an affirmative vote of the stockholders holding a
majority of each class of shares entitled to vote in an

election of directors at a stockholder meeting called specifically for that
purpose. The certificates of incorporation of both Interlott and GTECH define
"cause" to mean personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of
fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated
duties or willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic
violations or similar minor offenses).

  Officers

     Interlott.  Pursuant to the by-laws of Interlott, the officers of Interlott
are a chairman of the Board, a president, one or more vice presidents, a
secretary and a treasurer. In addition, the board of directors may elect a chief
executive officer and one or more of the following: executive vice president,
senior vice president, assistant vice president, chief financial officer, chief
operating officer, general counsel, assistant secretary and assistant treasurer.
Any number of offices may be held by the same person.

     GTECH.  Pursuant to the GTECH by-laws, GTECH's officers consist of a chief
executive officer, a president, one or more corporate vice presidents, a
treasurer and a secretary. GTECH also has a chairman, and may have one or more
co-chairmen and one or more vice chairmen. One person may hold the offices and
perform the duties of any two or more of the offices above, with the following
exceptions: (a) no chairman, co-chairman or vice chairman may be an officer of
GTECH unless the resolution of the Board electing an individual to such position
expressly so designates, provided, however, that no person may serve as both
chairman and chief executive officer, except as may be necessary on an interim
basis in the event of a vacancy in the office of the chief executive officer,
and (b) no one person may hold the offices and perform the duties of both
president and secretary. In addition, GTECH may have one or more non-corporate
vice presidents, assistant treasurers, assistant secretaries and assistant
controllers and such other subordinate officers, agents and employees as the
board of directors may deem necessary.

  Special Meetings of Stockholders

     Interlott.  A special meeting of stockholders can be called by (a) the
Board of Directors, (b) the chairman of the Board, (c) the chief executive
officer or (d) the holders of 2/3 of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue
proposed to be considered at the special meeting. Only business within the
purpose or purposes described in the special notice can be conducted at the
special meeting.

     GTECH.  Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be
called at any time by the board of directors. No other person or persons,
including the stockholders, may call a special meeting.

  Voting

     Interlott.  When a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved if a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the matter are voted in favor of the matter, unless a specified
provision of the certificate of incorporation, the by-laws or Delaware law
indicates a greater number of affirmative votes is necessary. Stockholders do
not have the right to accumulate their votes.

     GTECH.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding capital stock
of GTECH shall be the act of the stockholders; provided, however, that with
respect to any matter that has been approved by a majority of the total number
of directors of GTECH, the affirmative vote of a majority of the capital stock
present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of stockholders and
entitled to vote on the matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Unless
otherwise provided by law or by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board
of directors setting out the rights of the preferred stock holders, the
preferred stockholders (if any) of GTECH shall not vote on or consent to any
matter to be voted on or consented to by the stockholders of GTECH, and the
shares of preferred stock shall not be included in determining the number of
shares voting or entitled to vote on any such matters.

  Advance Notice of Stockholder-Proposed Business at Annual Meetings

     Interlott.  The Interlott by-laws provide that in order to bring business
before an annual meeting, a stockholder must satisfy all the conditions set out
in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 14a-8.

     GTECH.  The GTECH by-laws provide that in order to bring business before an
annual meeting, a stockholder must submit the proposal or nomination to the
Secretary of GTECH and it must be received in writing by the secretary not more

anniversary date, notice by the stockholder shall be delivered not earlier than
120 days prior to said meeting and not later than the close of business on the
latter of the 90th day prior to the meeting or the 10th day following the first
public announcement of the meeting. A stockholder's notice proposing to nominate
certain persons for election to the board of directors must contain:

     - information regarding the proposed nominee required by Regulation 14A of
       the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and

     - the proposed nominee's written consent to being named in the proxy
       statement and to serving as a director if elected.

     For a stockholder to bring other business before a meeting, he or she must

       any, on whose behalf the proposal is made.

     Finally, the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner of the
stock must provide:

     - the name and address of the stockholder as they appear in the corporate
       books, and of any beneficial owner,

     - the class and number of shares held by the stockholder and such
       beneficial owner,

     - a representation that the stockholder is entitled to vote and intends to
       appear in person or by proxy to propose the nomination or other matter
       specified in the notice, and

     - a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any,
       intends to be part of a group which intends to deliver a proxy statement

       necessary to approve or adopt the proposal, and/or to solicit proxies
       from other stockholders in support of such nomination.

  Amendment of Governing Documents

     Interlott.  Pursuant to its certificate of incorporation, Interlott
reserves the right at any time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provisions
contained in the certificate of incorporation. Under Delaware law, an amendment
to a corporation's certificate of incorporation requires:

     - the recommendation of a corporation's board of directors;

     - the approval of a majority of all shares entitled to vote thereon, voting
       together as a single class; and

     - the approval of a majority of the outstanding stock of each class
       entitled to vote on the amendment,

unless a higher vote is required in Interlott's certificate of incorporation.

     The by-laws may be amended or repealed and new by-laws may be adopted by
the board of directors or by the stockholders at any regular or special meeting.
Interlott's stockholders may amend or repeal any by-law adopted by its Board of
Directors.

     GTECH.  GTECH reserves the right to amend the restated certificate of
incorporation in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and, with the sole
exception of those rights and powers conferred under Article 8

of GTECH's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, all rights and
powers conferred by the restated certificate of incorporation on stockholders,
directors and officers, if any, are subject to this reserve power.

     Under Article 8, a director of GTECH shall have no personal liability to
GTECH or to its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
as a director except to the extent that Section 107(b)(7) (or any successor or
additional provision) of the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware, as
amended from time to time, expressly provides that the liability of a director
may not be eliminated or limited.

     The by-laws may be amended or repealed and new by-laws may be adopted by
the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of 66.66% of
the voting power of the outstanding stock at any annual meeting, or at any
special meeting if the notice of said meeting contained notice of the proposed
amendment.

                  APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED 1994 STOCK
                                 INCENTIVE PLAN

     Interlott's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan" or the "Plan")
provides for the grant of options to purchase common stock and the award of
restricted shares of common stock. Until late 2000, grants and awards under the
Incentive Plan only could be made to Interlott's employees, consultants and
advisors. Grants and awards to Interlott's nonemployee directors were required
to be made under a separate plan. The Incentive Plan was amended and restated in
December 2000, and approved by stockholders in May 2001, to permit grants to
nonemployee directors. At the time, additional shares were added to the Plan for
this purpose and to replenish the shares available for grants to employees.
After the 2000 amendment, the Plan authorized a total of 1,120,000 shares for
issuance, of which 663,450 were available for new grants.

     In late 2002, it became apparent that an insufficient number of shares had
been added in 2000. Additionally, a number of desirable updating changes to the
Plan were identified, including revisions to the Plan's change of control
provisions, deletion of language relating to Interlott's 1994 initial public
offering and provisions that have been unnecessary since that offering, and
simplification (without substantive change) of the section on Plan amendments.
On January 15, 2003, Interlott's Board of Directors amended and restated the
Incentive Plan for these purposes and directed that it be presented to
stockholders for reapproval.

     RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD.  Interlott's Board of Directors recommends
that stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended and restated effective January 15, 2003. The Board amended and restated
the Plan in the belief that it was a valuable means by which Interlott could
attract highly qualified employees, directors and others to serve Interlott and
can encourage them to further Interlott's growth. The Board recommends approval
of the amended and restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan even in view of the merger
because the Board believes failure to do so would unfairly disadvantage those
persons who received options which have not yet vested, including those
described under "Grants" below.

     A summary of the amended and restated Incentive Plan, including material
revisions, follows. The full text of the Plan is set forth as Annex E to this
proxy statement/prospectus and should be read for complete information.

     THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN.  Interlott may issue up to
2,120,000 shares of its common stock under the Incentive Plan, as amended.
Appropriate adjustments in the number of Plan shares issuable, and in the number
and price of shares covered by outstanding options, will be made to give effect
to changes in Interlott's capitalization. Shares attributable to the unexercised
portion of an expired or terminated option may be the subject of future Plan
grants. In order to comply with requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code relating to the deductibility of executive compensation, the
Incentive Plan includes a provision that options for no more than 500,000 shares
of common stock may be granted to any person during any 12-month period;
previously, this number was 300,000.

     The Incentive Plan is administered by Interlott's Board of Directors, which
has the authority to select recipients of Plan awards, determine the number of
shares covered by an award and, subject to the requirements of the Plan, set all
the terms and conditions of an award. The Board may appoint a committee of
directors to approve Plan awards and otherwise administer the Plan. However,
only the Board may amend or terminate the Plan, and it may do so at any time.
Interlott must seek stockholder approval for amendments as required by law and
the rules of the American Stock Exchange.

     When it was amended, the life of the Plan was extended from March 9, 2004
to January 14, 2013. No new awards under the Plan may be granted after that
date.

     STOCK OPTIONS.  Options granted under the Incentive Plan may be either
"incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
or "nonqualified" options. Either form of option may be granted to employees of
Interlott. Nonemployee directors and consultants and advisors may only receive
nonqualified options. To date, only employees and nonemployee directors of
Interlott have received options under the Incentive Plan, and all options
granted under the Plan have been nonqualified options. Interlott has never
awarded restricted shares.

     The per share exercise price of any option granted under the Plan may not
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the
option is granted. For purpose of the Plan, the "fair market value" of
Interlott's common stock is the closing price on the American Stock Exchange on
a given date. Incentive stock options granted to a person who holds more than
10% of Interlott's voting stock must have an exercise price of at least 110% of
fair market value on the date of grant and may be for a term no longer than five
years. Otherwise, no incentive stock option may have a term longer than ten
years. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, nonqualified options also have a
term of ten years and every option, whether incentive or nonqualified, becomes
exercisable as to 25% of its shares on each of the first through fourth
anniversaries of the option's date of grant. Notwithstanding any vesting
schedule, all of an optionee's options become fully exercisable if the optionee
becomes disabled or dies or in the event of a "change of control" (as described
below).

     An option's exercise price may be paid, at the election of the optionee, in
cash, with shares of Interlott's common stock that have been owned for at least
six months or by a combination of these methods. Shares used for this purpose
are valued at their fair market value on the date of option exercise.

     An option granted under the Incentive Plan is not transferable, except upon
the optionee's death, unless the board concludes that a transfer will not result
in accelerated taxation and otherwise is appropriate and desirable.

     An option which is not exercisable terminates when the optionee's
employment by or service to Interlott terminates. If the option is exercisable
at the time of termination of employment or service, it usually will terminate
on the earliest of its full exercise, its expiration date or three months after
the termination date. If, however, the termination of employment or service is
due to disability, the option may be exercised for one year after termination.
If an optionee dies (a) while employed by or performing services for Interlott,
(b) within three months after termination of employment or service for a reason
other than cause or (c) within a year after termination due to disability, the
option may be exercised for one year after the date of death. As amended, the
Incentive Plan similarly provides that, if an optionee's employment terminates
for a reason other than death or disability within one year after a change of
control, all options held on the date of termination of employment will be
exercisable for a year after that date. This period previously was three months.
Regardless of the extension of time during which an option can be exercised
after disability, death or a change control, an option cannot be exercised after
its expiration date.

     RESTRICTED SHARES.  The Board may award shares of restricted stock under
the Plan, although it has never done so. Any restricted shares awarded will vest
over a four-year period, at the rate of 25% a year beginning on the first
anniversary of the award. In addition, the Board may make the vesting and
ultimate receipt of restricted shares subject to the satisfaction of other
conditions and must specify the purchase price, if any, for restricted shares
that are awarded. Any restricted shares issued will have full voting and
dividend rights during the restricted period. Generally, unvested restricted
shares will be forfeited if the recipient's employment by or service to
Interlott terminates for any reason other than a change of control; however, the
Board may provide otherwise or may waive any remaining restrictions at the time
of termination. Any outstanding restricted shares become fully vested in the
event of a change of control.

     CHANGE OF CONTROL.  As indicated above, the Incentive Plan's provisions
relating to a change of control of Interlott were revised when the Plan was
amended and restated. As amended, the Plan provides that a "change of control"
will occur if (1) the beneficial ownership of Interlott's common stock by L.
Roger Wells, Jr. falls below 50.1% and another person, without approval or
ratification by Interlott's Board of Directors acquires beneficial ownership of
30% or more of Interlott's common stock; (2) immediately after a merger or
consolidation of Interlott with, or a sale of all or substantially all
Interlott's assets to, another corporation, in a transaction in which
outstanding grants and awards under the Incentive Plan are assumed or
substituted for by the surviving or acquiring corporation, and the voting shares
of Interlott outstanding before the transaction do not represent more than 50%
of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity or its parent; or (3)
during any fiscal year, the individuals who comprised the board of directors at
the beginning of the year no longer constitute a majority of the board, unless
the election or nomination for election of the new directors

has been approved in advance by a majority of the directors in office at the
beginning of the fiscal year. The merger will constitute a change of control for
purposes of the Plan.

     The amended Incentive Plan also provides that if Interlott proposes (1) to
merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all its assets in a transaction
in which outstanding Plan grants and awards will not be assumed or substituted
for or (2) to liquidate or dissolve, all options and restricted shares will
become fully vested immediately before, and subject to, completion of the
transaction. Optionees will have the right to exercise their options contingent
on completion of the transaction. If the transaction is completed, options that
have not been exercised will terminate. If the transaction is not completed, the
conditional vestings of options and restricted shares, and any option exercises,
will be deemed annulled and all grants and awards will return to their prior
status.

     FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES.  Generally, the recipient of an incentive
stock option recognizes no income upon the grant or exercise of the option. If
the stock purchased on exercise of an incentive stock option is not disposed of
within two years from the date of grant nor within one year after exercise, the
amount realized on the sale of the stock in excess of the option price is
treated as a long-term capital gain and Interlott is not entitled to a federal
income tax deduction. If stock acquired through the exercise of an incentive
stock option is disposed of before the expiration of either the prescribed
holding periods, the lesser of (a) the difference between the option price and
the fair market value at the time of exercise or (b) the difference between the
option price and the amount realized upon disposition is treated as ordinary
income to the optionee at the time of disposition, represents a preference item
for purposes of calculating alternative minimum tax and is allowed as a
deduction to Interlott. Any excess of the amount realized upon sale over the
fair market value at the time of exercise is generally treated as capital gain
to the optionee.

     Under most circumstances, an optionee who exercises a nonqualified option
recognizes taxable ordinary income, and Interlott is entitled to a deduction, at
the time of exercise of the option, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
market value of the shares purchased over the option price. At the time of a
subsequent sale of the shares, the optionee recognizes a taxable capital gain or
loss based upon the difference between the fair market value at the time of
exercise and the selling price.

     The recipient of restricted shares may elect to treat as income for the
year in which the restricted shares are received the fair market value of the
restricted shares awarded. If this election is not made, the recipient realizes
taxable income equal to the then fair market value of the restricted shares on
the date on which the restrictions lapse. In general, Interlott is entitled to
deduct amounts realized as income by the recipient.

     ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS.  The proceeds of the sale of stock under the
Plan constitute general funds of Interlott and may be used by it for any
purpose. Under accounting practices currently in effect and followed by
Interlott, the grant of an option to an employee or nonemployee director at fair
market value does not result in any charge against Interlott's earnings. On the
other hand, the grant of an option to an advisor or consultant to Interlott, and
any award of restricted shares, would result in compensation expense to
Interlott, with the expense and related tax benefits being recognized
systematically in Interlott's financial statements over the applicable vesting
or restricted period.

     GRANTS.  On January 15, 2003, the Board granted stock options under the
amended Incentive Plan for the following numbers of shares: L. Rogers Wells,
Jr., 211,000 shares; David F. Nichols, 55,200 shares; Dennis W. Blazer, 22,500
shares; Thomas W. Stokes, 24,600 shares; all current executive officers as a
group, 313,300 shares; each director who is not an executive officer (Gary S.
Bell, Kazmier J. Kasper, H. Jean McEntire, Edward F. Turek and John J.
Wingfield), 10,500 shares, for an aggregate of 52,500 shares; and all employees,
including all current officers who are not executive officers, as a group,
29,500 shares. Although these option grants are contingent on stockholder
approval of the amended Incentive Plan, that approval is assured due to Mr.
Wells' ownership of a majority of Interlott's common stock. The Plan has no
limit on the number of participants. Upon the closing of the merger, the Plan
will terminate, all outstanding options will be vested and option holders will
receive cash payments equal to the difference between $9.00 per share and the
exercise price of the options. See "The Merger-Interests of Certain Persons in
the Merger."

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR"
APPROVAL OF THE 1994 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE
JANUARY 15, 2003.

               MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Interlott's Board of Directors conducts its business through meetings of
the full board and through committees of the board, including standing Audit and
Compensation Committees. During 2002, the Board of Directors held three
meetings, the Audit Committee held three meetings and the Compensation Committee
met informally. Each director except Kazmier Kasper attended at least 75% of all
meetings of the full Board and of each committee of the Board of which he or she
is a member.

     The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing with Interlott's
independent auditors their audit plan and the scope and results of their audit;
reviewing the scope and results of Interlott's internal auditing procedures;
consulting with the independent auditors and management with regard to
Interlott's accounting methods and the adequacy of its internal accounting
controls; approving professional services provided by the independent auditors;
reviewing the independence of the independent auditors; and reviewing the range
of the independent auditors' audit and non-audit fees. The Audit Committee is
composed of Gary S. Bell, H. Jean McEntire and John J. Wingfield (Chair). Each
of the Committee's members is a nonemployee director of Interlott. Ms. McEntire
and Mr. Wingfield are "independent" directors within the meaning of Section
121(A) of the American Stock Exchange's current listing standards. Mr. Bell does
not qualify as independent under those standards because of his position as
President of International Investments, Inc., which is owned by L. Rogers Wells,
Jr. and to which Interlott has paid a fee for consulting services provided by
Mr. Bell. However, Interlott's Board has determined that Mr. Bell's membership
on the Audit Committee is in the best interests of Interlott and its
stockholders because of his banking and financial background. The Audit
Committee's charter was included as an exhibit to Interlott's Proxy Statement
for the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

     The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the compensation of
the Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief Executive Officer and
ratifying the compensation of all other officers and general wage and salary
limits of employees. The Compensation Committee is composed of Gary S. Bell
(Chair), H. Jean McEntire and John J. Wingfield. The Compensation Committee's
annual report is furnished below.

     The Board of Directors as a whole functions as a nominating committee to
select management's nominees for election as directors of Interlott. The Board
of Directors will consider nominees recommended by stockholders if submitted to
Interlott in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3 of
Interlott's Bylaws.

Audit Committee Report

     The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Interlott's audited
consolidated financial statements with management. Further, the Audit Committee
has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP, Interlott's independent public
accountants, the matters required to be discussed by the Statement of Auditing
Standards No. 61 (SAS 61 -- Communication with Audit Committees) relating to the
accountants' judgment about the quality of Interlott's accounting principles,
judgments and estimates, as applied in its financial reporting.

     The Audit Committee also has received the written disclosures and the
letter from Grant Thornton required by Independent Standards board Standard No.
1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees) that relates to Grant
Thornton's independence from Interlott, and has discussed with Grant Thornton
their independence.

     Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee
recommended to the Board that Interlott's audited financial statements be
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002,
for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     This report by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee") discusses the compensation objectives and policies applicable to
Interlott's executive officers. The report reviews the Committee's policy
generally with respect to the compensation of all executive officers as a group
and specifically reviews the compensation of Interlott's Chief Executive
Officer. The Committee is composed entirely of non-employee directors of
Interlott.

     To date, the Committee has made its compensation decisions based upon the
recommendations of Interlott's Chief Executive Officer and upon his and the
Committee's subjective evaluations of each executive officer's past performance
and anticipated ability to positively impact Interlott's future growth and
development. The Committee met informally in 2002 and its recommendations were
approved by the full Interlott Board of Directors.

  COMPENSATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     Interlott's compensation policies for its executive officers are intended
to create a direct relationship between the level of compensation paid and
Interlott's current and long-term performance. The Committee believes that this
relationship is best implemented by providing a compensation package consisting
of a base salary, discretionary bonus and long-term incentive compensation in
the form of stock options.

     The Committee believes that base salaries need to be competitive when
compared to those of officers in corresponding positions at similarly sized
companies in the manufacturing and gaming industry, although Interlott's
salaries still remain modest in comparison to salaries of executives of those
companies. The bonuses reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for Messrs.
Blazer and Stokes were awarded in recognition of their positive contributions to
Interlott's performance in 2002.

     To provide further incentive for employee performance, and to establish a
direct link between that performance and stockholder value, Interlott generally
makes an annual award of stock options under the Incentive Plan to its executive
officers (as well as certain other employees). Through these stock options,
opportunities for additional compensation by Interlott's executive officers are
tied directly to increases in the price of Interlott's Common Stock. The options
granted under the Incentive Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of Interlott's Common Stock on the date of grant and, to encourage a
long-term perspective by the employee, have an exercise period of ten years.
Each named executive officer received an option grant on March 6, 2002.
Information on these grants and on stock options held by the named executive
officers as of December 31, 2002 is set forth in the Interlott 10-K under the
heading "Item 11. Executive Compensation."

  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     Effective January 1, 2001, Interlott entered into an employment agreement
with Mr. Nichols, Interlott's Chief Executive Officer, which provides for a
minimum annual base salary and for bonuses tied directly to Interlott's
financial performance. For 2002, Mr. Nichols' base salary was $226,317 and,
pursuant to the formula in his employment agreement, he received a year-end
bonus of $139,400. In 2002, Mr. Wells, Interlott's Chairman of the board,
received a salary of $350,000. Along with Interlott's other executive officers,
both Mr. Nichols and Mr. Wells received annual stock option awards in March
2002. These awards will

enable the executives to realize increased compensation if and to the extent
that Interlott's performance results in an increase in the price of the Common
Stock. As a result, any additional compensation due to these stock options will
be tied directly to an increase in overall stockholder value.

  SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of
compensation paid to each of Interlott's named executive officers to $1 million
for any year unless several requirements are met. The Committee has reviewed
these requirements and believes that all compensation paid to its executive
officers in 2002 is fully deductible.

                      EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

     Interlott has three compensation plans under which shares of its common
stock may be issued: the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, described above; the 1994
Directors Stock Incentive Plan, under which options were granted to Interlott's
nonemployee directors prior to 2000; and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Each
of these plans has been approved by stockholders. Interlott has no equity
compensation plans or arrangements that have not been approved by stockholders.

     The following table provides information concerning Interlott's equity
compensation plans as of December 31, 2002. The additional shares authorized for
issuance under the Incentive Plan as amended and restated effective January 15,
2003, and the stock options granted on that date, are not included.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of March 17, 2003, by and among Interlott Technologies,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), GTECH Holdings Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), GTECH Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), and Bengal
Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merger
Subsidiary (the "Original Merger Subsidiary"), as amended and restated hereby
(the "Amended and Restated Agreement") dated April   , 2003 and effective as of
March 17, 2003.

     WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed to amend and restate the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Original Merger Agreement") dated as of March 17, 2003,
among the Company, Parent and Original Merger Subsidiary, in order to permit
Merger Subsidiary to assume the rights and responsibilities of Original Merger
Subsidiary thereunder;

     WHEREAS, the parties intend, notwithstanding such amendment and
restatement, that this Agreement continues to speak as of March 17, 2003 and
unless otherwise expressly provided herein, the phrases "the date hereof," "the
date of this Agreement," and similar phrases used herein shall mean March 17,
2003;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto, effective as of March 17, 2003, hereby amend and restate the
Original Merger Agreement in its entirety as follows:

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the Company have approved the merger of the Company into Merger Subsidiary
(the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock" or
the "Shares"), excluding certain Shares described herein (including Dissenting
Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(as defined herein); and

     WHEREAS, following the recommendations of the Special Committee, the Board
of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved and determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the
stockholders of the Company, and has resolved to recommend approval and adoption
of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by
such stockholders; and

     WHEREAS, Parent and Original Merger Subsidiary were unwilling to enter into
the Original Merger Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the beneficial and record holder of a majority of
the Company Common Stock entered into the Stockholder Voting and Option
Agreement and the Noncompete Agreement, and such stockholder has executed and
delivered both such agreements, and Parent, Original Merger Subsidiary, Merger
Subsidiary and such stockholder are executing an Amended and Restated
Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement simultaneously with this Amended and
Restated Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the consummation thereof;

                                       A-1

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises,
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows (certain
capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 10.4):

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.1.  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Company shall be
merged with and into Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time (as defined
herein). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall cease, and the Merger Subsidiary shall continue its corporate existence
under the laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation. (Merger
Subsidiary and the Company are sometimes hereinafter referred to as "Constituent
Corporations" and Merger Subsidiary, after giving effect to the Merger, is
sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation.")

     SECTION 1.2.  Closing.  Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
and the transaction contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Section 9.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., (local time) on the first business day following satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof at
the offices of Edwards & Angell, LLP, Providence, Rhode Island, unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. At the time
of the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary will file a certificate of
merger in such form as may be required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, the DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with
the Merger.

     SECTION 1.3.  Effective Time of The Merger.  The Merger shall, subject to
the DGCL, become effective as of such time as the certificate of merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time
thereafter as is provided in the certificate of merger (the "Effective Time").

     SECTION 1.4.  Effects of the Merger.  From and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable sections of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Constituent Corporations shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Constituent Corporations shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 1.5.  Subsequent Actions.  If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Subsidiary
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
hereby authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company and the Merger Subsidiary, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments
and assurances and to take, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation
or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable
to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to or
under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                       A-2

                                   ARTICLE II

                      EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL
                     STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

     SECTION 2.1.  Conversion of Shares.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any party
hereto or the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary:

     (a) All Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock and all Shares owned
by the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in
a fiduciary capacity, including Shares held by a Company Benefit Plan, that are
beneficially owned by third parties (any such Shares, and shares of Parent's
common stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by
the Company or the Parent, being referred to as "Trust Account Shares") and
other than any Shares held directly or indirectly by the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any
such Shares, and shares of Parent's common stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by the Company or the Parent, being referred
to herein as "DPC Shares") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. All shares of Parent's common
stock that are owned by the Company (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC
Shares) shall become treasury stock of Parent.

     (b) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

     (c) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(f) or as
provided in Section 2.3 with respect to Dissenting Shares, and subject to
Section 9.1(k), be converted into, at the election of the holder as provided in
and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, either (i) the right
to receive $9.00 in cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), less any
required withholding of Taxes or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"). The Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration are collectively referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration". The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the quotient
(rounded to the nearest fourth decimal place) obtained by dividing $9.00 by the
Average Closing Price on the trading day which is three business days preceding
the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting occurs.

     (d) All Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, when converted as provided in this Section 2.1, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate previously evidencing such Shares, excluding Shares
described in Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective
Time the holders of certificates evidencing Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company
Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or as required by Law.

     (e) Each Person set forth in Section 4.5 of the Company's Disclosure
Schedule holds an option or options, in the amounts and at the prices set forth
in such section, to acquire Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company's stock option plans or similar arrangements
(each, an "Option," and collectively, the "Options") that is or will be vested
prior to, or effective with, the Effective Time, and shall have the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation in respect of each Share underlying such
Option, less any required withholding of Taxes, a cash payment in an amount
equal to the positive difference (if any) between the Cash Consideration and the
exercise price per Share applicable to such Option as stated in the applicable
stock option agreement or other document (the "Option Consideration"); provided
that with respect to any Person subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, no
Option Consideration shall be paid to such Person until payment can be made
without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the

                                       A-3

Exchange Act. The Company shall take such other actions (including, without
limitation, giving requisite notices to holders of Options advising them of such
accelerated exercisability and right to obtain payment for their respective
Options) as are necessary to fully advise holders of Options of their rights and
to facilitate their timely exercise of such rights. From and after the Effective
Time, other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.1(e), the holders of
Options shall cease to have any rights in respect to such Options other than to
receive payment for his or her Options as set forth herein.

     (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be
issued in the Merger; instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying
such fraction by the Average Closing Price on the trading day which is three
business days preceding the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting
occurs.

     SECTION 2.2.  Election and Proration Procedures; Exchange Procedures.

     (a) An election form (an "Election Form") and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing
Company Common Stock ("Certificates") shall pass only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in such form as Company and
Parent shall mutually agree shall be mailed on the Mailing Date (as defined
below) to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of a record
date which shall be the same date as the record date for eligibility to vote on
the Merger. The "Mailing Date" shall be the date on which proxy materials
relating to the Merger are mailed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
The Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

     (b) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of Company Common
Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation
and instructions) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of such
holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii) elect to receive the Stock
Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a "Stock Election"), (iii) elect
to receive the Cash Consideration with respect to some of such holder's shares
and the Stock Consideration with respect to such holder's remaining shares (a
"Mixed Election"), or (iv) make no election or to indicate that such holder has
no preference as to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock
Consideration (a "Non-Election"). Holders of record of shares of Company Common
Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative
capacities (a "Stockholder Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms,
provided that such Stockholder Representative certifies that each such Election
Form covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by that Representative
for a particular beneficial owner. Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a
Cash Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are
referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of Company Common Stock as
to which a Stock Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election)
are referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of Company Common
Stock as to which no election has been made are referred to as "Non-Election
Shares." The aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as the "Stock
Election Number."

     (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth
business day immediately preceding the Company Stockholders Meeting (or such
other time and date as the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the "Election
Deadline"). An election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if
required by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(n), indemnification regarding the
loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with
the Election Form. Any Company stockholder may at any time prior to the Election
Deadline change his or her election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a

                                       A-4

properly completed and signed revised Election Form. Any Company stockholder
may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or
by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of
the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. All elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange
Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the Company that this Agreement has
been terminated. If a stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form by the Election Deadline, or (ii) revokes its Election
Form prior to the Election Deadline and does not submit a new properly executed
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
held by such stockholder shall be designated Non-Election Shares. Parent shall
cause the Certificates representing Company Common Stock described in (ii) to be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from the person who submitted the Election Form.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.

     (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, 51.5%
of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time (the "Stock Conversion Number") shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding (i) shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(a) of this
Agreement and (ii) Dissenters' Shares (together, the "Excluded Shares," with the
shares remaining outstanding after such exclusion constituting, for purposes of
this Agreement, the "Outstanding Company Shares")); provided, however, that for
federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in order that the
Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest requirements under
applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under
Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent shall increase the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that will be converted into the Stock Consideration and
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration to ensure that the Stock
Consideration will represent at least 50% of the value of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, increased by the value of any Excluded Shares, each as measured
as of the Effective Time.

     (e)  Within three business days after the later to occur of the Election
Deadline or the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect
the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

          (i)  If the Stock Election Number equals or exceeds the Stock
     Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election
     Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
     and each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the
     Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares
     equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock
     Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
     which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
     Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock
     Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
     Consideration;

          (ii)  If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
     Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
     Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then
     all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
     Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares
     shall be treated in the following manner:

             (A)  if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of
        Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted
        into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and each holder of
        Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
        that number

                                       A-5

        of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
        the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
        the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of
        which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining
        number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the
        right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

             (B)  if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
        Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right
        to receive the Stock Consideration, and each holder of Cash Election
        Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number
        of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
        the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
        fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the
        Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
        the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares,
        with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being
        converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

             For purposes of this Section 2.2(e), if Parent is obligated to
        increase the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted
        into shares of Parent Common Stock as a result of the application of the
        proviso of Section 2.2(d) above, then the higher number shall be
        substituted for the Stock Conversion Number in the calculations set
        forth in this Section 2.2(e).

     (f)  Appropriate transmittal materials (the "Letter of Transmittal") in a
form satisfactory to Parent and the Company shall be mailed within three
business days after the Effective Time to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock as of the Effective Time who did not previously submit a completed
Election Form. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by certificates representing all shares of Company Common Stock to
be converted thereby.

     (g)  At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate (except as
specifically set forth in Section 2.1 and except for Dissenting Shares) shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

     (h)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, an
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and the
aggregate amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(f), and Parent shall reserve for issuance with its transfer agent
and registrar a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to provide
for payment of the aggregate Stock Consideration.

     (i)  The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Parent may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Cash Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (w) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1, if any, and (x) a check in the amount equal to
the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1, if
any, (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.2.
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable
following receipt of the properly completed Letter of Transmittal and any
necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent shall distribute Parent
Common Stock and cash as provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it
shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If
there is a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Certificates representing such
Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the

                                       A-6

Exchange Agent, (y) to evidence and effect such transfer and (z) to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     (j)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Certificates in
accordance with this Section 2.2. Upon the surrender of such person's
Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective Time
had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such person's Certificates.

     (k)  The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company
Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.

     (l)  Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to this
Section 2.2 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remain unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the written request of
Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall look only to Parent for the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.1 of this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates are not
surrendered prior to the date on which such payments would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by any abandoned property, escheat or other
applicable laws, become the property of Parent (and, to the extent not in its
possession, shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate
thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

     (m)  Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares or Options such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares or Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon Company's stock transfer books to establish the identity
of those persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall
be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect
to any claims thereto.

     (n)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.1.

     (o)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Election
Form, all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by any Person
identified as a Company Affiliate under Section 6.2 hereof

                                       A-7

shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares until such time as such person
delivers to Parent an executed copy of the Company Affiliates Agreement
described in such Section 6.2.

     SECTION 2.3.  Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, and unless otherwise provided by applicable Law,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
of Shares who is entitled to and has demanded and perfected his or her right of
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c), unless and until such holder
withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to an appraisal of the Shares and
payment under the DGCL. Such Shares instead shall, from and after the Effective
Time, represent only the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that if, after the Effective Time, any such holder withdraws or loses his or her
right to an appraisal of the Shares under the DGCL, such Shares shall thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the certificate or certificates formerly representing such Shares, less any
required withholding of Taxes. The Company shall give all notices required under
Section 262 of the DGCL and otherwise comply with the requirements of Section
262 of the DGCL. In addition, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal of the Shares or settle or offer to
settle any such demands.

     SECTION 2.4.  Adjustment of Merger Consideration and Option
Consideration.  The Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and
the Option Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) have been calculated
based upon the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section
4.5. Without limiting the effect of the failure of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Section 4.5 to be true and correct, in the
event that, at the Effective Time, the actual number of shares of capital stock
of the Company outstanding and/or the actual number of shares of capital stock
of the Company issuable upon the exercise of outstanding Options, warrants or
similar agreements or upon conversion of securities (including without
limitation, as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Shares, or
recapitalization) is greater than as described in Section 4.5 (including the
exercise or conversion of any currently outstanding Options, warrants or similar
agreements described in Section 4.5), the Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted downward.

                                  ARTICLE III

                           THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

     SECTION 3.1.  Certificate of Incorporation.  At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

     SECTION 3.2.  Bylaws.  At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

     SECTION 3.3.  Directors and Officers.  From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable Law, the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall comprise all of the directors of the Surviving Corporation.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the directors of Merger Subsidiary to
appoint the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the
Effective Time as all the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 3.4.  Contribution of Company Business.  Prior to the Effective
Time, Merger Subsidiary shall have formed under the laws of the State of
Delaware a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary ("Newco"),

                                       A-8

which may be Original Merger Subsidiary, and which, prior to the date on which
such assets are transferred pursuant to the succeeding sentence, shall have no
assets and will have conducted no business operations (except for any assets and
business operations necessary for its formation and qualification as a foreign
corporation and any operations contemplated by the Original Merger Agreement or
this Amended and Restated Agreement). Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall transfer to Newco all of the assets, liabilities and
businesses relating to the Company as the Company's business was conducted
immediately prior to the Effective Time in a transaction described in Section
368(a)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that such transfer and all
transactions to be undertaken in connection with this Section 3.4 hereof shall
not in any way expand the conditions to, or otherwise affect or delay, the
obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with this
Amended and Restated Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that,
except as otherwise set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:

     SECTION 4.1.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
licenses, authorizations, certificates, consents and approvals of Governmental
Authorities (collectively, "Licenses") required to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, other than
those Licenses which the failure to so obtain would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete
copies of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as currently in
effect.

     SECTION 4.2.  Corporate Authorization.  The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and
to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action, except for the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on the Merger and this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, subject to receipt of the approvals specified in Section 4.3 herein and
subject to the approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement by a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon, constitutes a
valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability of this
Agreement may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors, and (ii) general equitable principles, regardless of
whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law.

     SECTION 4.3.  Authorizations.  The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby require no consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with or notice to any
Person by or with respect to the Company, other than (i) the filing of a
certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL and this Agreement, (ii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
(iv) the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares
entitled to vote on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, (v)
compliance with state laws relating to takeovers, if applicable, state
securities or blue sky laws, (vi) any consents, authorizations, approvals,
filings or exemptions in connection with the rules of the NYSE or AMEX, and
(vii) such other consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations the
failure of which to obtain or make would not (A) reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the

                                       A-9

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (B) materially impair the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (C)
prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

     SECTION 4.4.  Non-Contravention.  The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not contravene or conflict
with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
enhancement or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a benefit under, or
give rise to the creation of any Lien or any right of first refusal with respect
to, any asset or property of the Company, pursuant to (i) any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the
Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.3,
any provision of any material Law binding upon or applicable to the Company or
its properties or assets, (iii) any Contract binding upon the Company, or (iv)
any License held by the Company, except in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv)
above, as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     SECTION 4.5.  Capitalization.

     (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are outstanding (i) 6,459,718 shares of
Company Common Stock, including all shares restricted under any compensation
plan or arrangement of the Company, and (ii) Options to purchase an aggregate of
1,439,500 shares of Company Common Stock, all of which are subject to the
Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated effective January
15, 2003, subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders) (the "Stock
Incentive Plan"). As of the date of this Agreement, 22,444 shares of Company
Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") and 1,439,500 shares of Company Common
Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan, and 10,500
shares of Company Common Stock are held in treasury by the Company. As of March
31, 2003, the Company expects that participants in the Stock Purchase Plan will
have made contributions toward the purchase of approximately 4,000 shares of
Company Common Stock under the Stock Purchase Plan. There are no shares of
Company Preferred Stock outstanding and no options, warrants or other agreements
outstanding to purchase shares of Company Preferred Stock.

     (b) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (i) have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii)
are not subject to preemptive or other similar rights (and were not issued in
violation of any such rights), and (iii) were issued in compliance with all
applicable federal and state securities Laws. Except as set forth in this
Section 4.5 and except for changes after the date of this Agreement resulting
solely from the exercise of Options outstanding on such date (and identified in
Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), there are no outstanding (i)
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, (ii)
securities of the Company convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, and (iii) options
or other rights to acquire from the Company, or obligations of the Company to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the
Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to collectively
as the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities.

     (c) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Company Securities having the right to vote) on any matters.

     (d) Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, a true and correct listing of (i) each option to
purchase any Company Securities, the holder thereof, the number and type of
Company Securities purchasable thereunder, the dates upon which such options
become exercisable and expire, and the exercise prices at which such options are
exercisable (none of which options has been repriced, except as set forth in
Section 4.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and (ii) a list of each

                                       A-10

other right to acquire any Company Securities pursuant to any other agreement or
instrument, describing such right and indicating the holder thereof. There are
no employment, executive termination or other agreements providing for the
issuance of any Company Securities. There are no outstanding stock appreciation
rights or other outstanding contractual rights the value of which is derived
from the financial performance of the Company or the value of shares of Company
Common Stock. The amendment and restatement of the Stock Incentive Plan was
approved by the Company's Board of Directors as of January 15, 2003 and is
expected to be submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. In a writing dated January 15, 2003, the Majority
Shareholder acknowledged his approval of such amendment and restatement and his
intention to vote 100% of his Company Common Stock in favor of approval thereof.

     (e) Other than the Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement, there are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company is a party, by which it is bound or of which the Company is
aware relating to the voting or disposition of any Company Securities (including
any such agreements or understandings that may limit in any way the solicitation
of proxies by or on behalf of the Company from, or the casting of votes by, the
stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger). There are no
registration rights applicable to any Company Securities.

     SECTION 4.6.  Subsidiaries.

     (a) The Company has no Subsidiaries. Without limiting the effect of the
failure of the representation in this Section 4.6(a) to be true and correct, to
the extent the Company does have any Subsidiaries, each of the representations
and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and any covenants or agreements
of the Company in this Agreement shall be read as if given as to or made by the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in order not to limit the
effect of the representation, warranty or covenant.

     (b) The Company (i) does not directly or indirectly own, (ii) has not
agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire, and (iii) does not hold any interest
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, any of the capital stock or
other equity interest of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company
or other business association or entity.

     SECTION 4.7.  SEC and Related Filings.

     (a) The Company has provided to Parent true and complete copies of (i) the
Company's annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001 (the 2001 Form 10-K being referred to herein as the "Company
Form 10-K"), (ii) the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for its fiscal
quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002 (the
"Company Form 10-Qs"), (iii) the Company's proxy or information statements
relating to meetings of, or actions taken without a meeting by, the stockholders
of the Company since January 1, 2000 (the Company's proxy statements for the
2001 and 2002 annual meetings of shareholders being referred to herein as the
"Company 2001 and 2002 Proxy Statements"), and (iv) all of the Company's other
forms, reports, exhibits, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements and other documents, filed with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (the
items in subsections (i) through (iv) collectively, the "Company Securities
Documents"). Each document or report that the Company has been required to file
with the SEC since January 1, 2000 has been timely filed by the Company.

     (b) As of their respective filing dates (or, in the case of registration
statements, their respective effective dates), the Company Securities Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or applicable state securities laws, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations thereunder. None of the Company Securities Documents
at the time filed (or in the case of registration statements, their respective
effective dates) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

     SECTION 4.8.  Company Financial Statements.  The audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in
the Company Securities Documents (including any pro forma financial information
contained therein) have been prepared from and are in accordance with the books
and records of the Company and complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules

                                       A-11

know of any occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or

and correct listing of all material Registered Intellectual Property owned by
the Company (the "Owned Intellectual Property") and all material Intellectual
Property used by the Company under license or similar agreement (the "Licensed

interest in and to the Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens,
and is the valid licensee of the Licensed Intellectual Property. None of the

business does not infringe upon or violate the Intellectual Property rights of

any royalty, license fee, charge or other amount with regard to, any

either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) or Section 502(l) of
ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code.

     (d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified by issuance and receipt of a favorable determination letter or
reliance upon an opinion letter which states that the Company Benefit Plan meets
all requirements under the Code and that any trust(s) associated with such
Company Benefit Plan is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each such
Company Benefit Plan has filed or will file an application for a favorable
determination letter from the IRS which covers recent tax law changes commonly
known as "GUST" within the GUST remedial amendment period (to the extent such

audit, investigation or examination is threatened or pending.

     (f) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) that are due with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed by ERISA and the Code to
each such plan and all contributions for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date which are not yet due have been made to each such Company Benefit

of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
liability under Title IV of ERISA, and no events have occurred and no
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in such
liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

     (h) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes to
or has ever maintained or been obligated to contribute to, or has any liability
with respect to, a Multiemployer Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability due to a complete or partial withdrawal
from a Multiemployer Plan or due to the termination or reorganization of a
Multiemployer Plan (except for any such liability as has been satisfied in

reasonably be expected to result in such liability to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate.

by each Plan's accountants.

     (j) All Company Benefit Plans may, without liability, be prospectively
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued except as specifically prohibited
by federal law.

     (k) Any bonding required under ERISA with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan has been obtained and is in full force and effect.

     (l) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains any retired life
and/or retired health insurance plans which provide for continuing benefits or
coverage for any employee or any beneficiary of an employee after such
employee's termination of employment, except where the continuation of such
coverage is required by Law. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has complied
in all material respects with the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA.

     (m) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due from the Company under
any Company Benefit Plan; (ii) materially increase any benefit otherwise payable
under any Company Benefit Plan; or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of, any compensation due to any individual.

provide payments to any officer, employee or highly compensated individual which

     (a) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and
held, has by unanimous vote of those directors present (who constituted all of
the directors then in office) (i) approved and adopted this Agreement, (ii)
determined that the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholder Voting and Option
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are advisable and
fair to and in the best interests of the holders of Company Common Stock, and
(iii) recommended that the holders of Company Common Stock approve the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Special Committee,
at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote recommended to the
Board of Directors of the Company (i) approval and adoption of this Agreement,

advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the public stockholders of
the Company, and (iii) the recommendation that the holders of Company Common

     (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement, prior to execution,

Agreement, in accordance with Section 203 of the DGCL, so that such Section will
not apply to Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Merger, this Agreement, the
Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. No provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company would, directly or indirectly, restrict
or impair the ability of Parent or its affiliates to vote, or otherwise to
exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, securities of the Company
that may be acquired or controlled by Parent or its affiliates or permit any
stockholder to acquire securities of the Company on a basis not available to
Parent in the event that Parent were to acquire securities of the Company, and
the Company does not have any rights plan, preferred stock or similar
arrangement which has any of the aforementioned consequences.

     (c) The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled
to vote to approve this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class
of capital or series of the Company's capital stock or other voting securities
necessary to approve the Merger.

     SECTION 4.27.  Prior Negotiations.  Since January 1, 2003, the Company and
its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and advisors
(including the Company's financial advisor) have not been involved in
substantive discussions with any group or Person or any of their respective
representatives or advisors, or furnished material confidential information to
any such group or Person or any of their respective representatives or advisors
in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal.

     SECTION 4.28.  Certain Business Practices.  Neither the Company nor any of
its directors, officers, agents or employees has (i) used any funds for unlawful
contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to
political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
governmental officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties
or campaigns or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended, (iii) consummated any transaction, made any payment, entered
into any agreement or arrangement or taken any other action in violation of
Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, as amended, or (iv) made any other
unlawful payment, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                                       A-19

     SECTION 4.29.  Affiliate Transactions.  Except as set forth in the Company
Form 10-K, Company Form 10-Qs or the Company 2001 and 2002 Proxy Statements,
since January 1, 2001, no director, officer, partner, key employee, "affiliate"
or "associate" (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act)
of the Company (or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons)
(i) has borrowed any monies from or has outstanding any indebtedness or other
similar obligations to the Company, (ii) to the best of the Company's knowledge,
except for shares of a publicly traded company (in an amount not in excess of 5%
of the outstanding shares of such company) owns any direct or indirect material
interest of any kind in, or is a director, officer, employee, partner, affiliate
or associate of, or consultant or lender to, or borrower from, or has the right
to participate in the management, operations or profits of, any person or entity
which since January 1, 2000 has been a material competitor, supplier, customer,
distributor, lessor, tenant, creditor or debtor of the Company, or (iii) is
otherwise a party to any material Contract with the Company. Any such Contract
with the Company, whether written or oral, has been negotiated on an arms length
basis and is on terms no less favorable to the Company than would be obtainable
from unaffiliated third parties.

     SECTION 4.30.  Full Disclosure.  All documents and other papers delivered
by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are accurate and complete in all material respects and are
authentic. No representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                        OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and each has all requisite
corporate power and authority and all material Licenses required to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now

Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Original Merger
Subsidiary are each duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
and assets owned, leased or operated by each or the nature of their respective
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the certificates
of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and Merger Subsidiary as currently in
effect.

     SECTION 5.2.  Corporate Authorization.  Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
Original Merger Subsidiary each have all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Stockholder Voting and
Option Agreement and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and the execution, delivery and performance by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and Original Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the Stockholder
Voting and Option Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action. This Agreement and the Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement have been
duly executed and delivered by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Original Merger
Subsidiary and constitute valid, legal and binding agreements of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and Original Merger Subsidiary enforceable against each of them in
accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability of such
agreements may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors, and (ii) general equitable principles, regardless of

or notice to any Person by or with respect to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
Original Merger Subsidiary, other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger
in accordance with DGCL and this Agreement; (ii) compliance with any applicable

orders, authorizations the failure of which to obtain or make would not (A)
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Parent, (B) materially impair the ability of the Parent or
Merger Subsidiary to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement,
or (C) prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

     SECTION 5.4.  Non-Contravention.  The execution, delivery and performance
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Original Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement
and the Stockholder Voting and Option Agreement and the consummation by them of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not contravene
or conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, enhancement or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a
benefit under, or give rise to the creation of any Lien or any right of first
refusal with respect to, any asset or property of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
Original Merger Subsidiary, pursuant to (i) any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Original Merger
Subsidiary, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section

Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

the Exchange Act or applicable state securities laws, as the case may be, and

Agreement, since the date of Parent Balance Sheet, Parent has conducted its
business in the Ordinary Course and there has not

                                       A-22

been any event, occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     SECTION 5.11.  Litigation.  Except as set forth in the Parent Securities

against, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against or
affecting, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties
or assets or any of their respective directors and officers in their capacities
as such before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, or with
respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has retained or assumed
responsibility by contract or operation of Law. No such claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding if adversely determined, would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There are no judgments,
decrees, orders, writs, injunctions, determinations or awards issued by any
court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority currently outstanding and
unsatisfied against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries has retained or assumed responsibility by contract or
operation of Law. Except as set forth in the Parent Securities Documents, there
are no indemnification agreements between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on
the one hand, and any directors, officers, employees or other agents of Parent
or any of its current or former Subsidiaries on the other hand. There are no

of its Subsidiaries within the last three years, during such period while owned
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) have been, in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable material Laws, including, but not limited to, the
HSR Act and all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment and wages. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received during the last three years, any notice, order or
other communication from any Governmental Authority of any alleged, actual or
potential violation of or failure to comply in any material respect with any
Law.

     (b) All Licenses required for the operation of the business of Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted are in full force and effect
without any default or violation thereunder by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party thereto, except where any
such default or violation or the failure of any such License to be in full force
and effect has not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Since January 1, 2000,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, order or
other communication from any Governmental Authority of any alleged, actual or
potential violation of or default under any such License in any material
respect.

     SECTION 5.13.  Real Property.  Except as disclosed in the Parent Securities

real properties owned by them, free from Liens that would materially affect the

material respect from the value or marketability of the property subject thereto
and do not materially interfere with the current use of such property. The
material properties and assets owned or leased by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are in the possession or under the control of Parent or such
Subsidiaries and are in good condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used and are of
a condition, nature and quantity sufficient for the conduct of the businesses of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

     (a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns in
the jurisdictions where such returns are required to be filed, except for
personal property, sales and use and other state and local non-income Tax
Returns, the nonfiling of which would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or its Subsidiaries. All such Tax Returns are
complete and correct in all material respects. All Tax liabilities of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, whether or not shown to be due on Tax Returns, have been paid
or adequate reserves established on financial statements.

     (b) There are no Tax Liens upon the assets of Parent or any of its

full and, no audits or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are
currently pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries where an adverse determination could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.

     (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to a Tax assessment or deficiency where an adverse determination could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.

authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not
file income or franchise Tax Returns that such entity may be subject to income
or franchise Taxes in that jurisdiction.

respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment

businesses and operations, are, and since January 1, 2000, have been, operated

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     (b) There are no conditions on or beneath any real property which is now
owned, used or leased to or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Parent
Current Real Property") which might, under any applicable Environmental Law, (i)

require any Response, Removal or Remedial Action or any other action, including
without limitation reporting, monitoring, cleanup or contribution, which would

Subsidiaries.

material liability or the imposition of a statutory Lien, or (ii) require any
Response, Removal or Remedial Action or any other action, including without
limitation reporting, monitoring, cleanup or contribution, which would require a
material expenditure or commitment by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

                                       A-24

     (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaires has received any written

Parent Former Real Property, no Hazardous Substances were used, handled,

discharged or disposed of by Parent, its Subsidiaries or, to the best of
Parent's knowledge, any third party, on or beneath the Parent Former Real
Property except in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, or where

     applicable Environmental Law;

          (ii) any claim, demand notice, suit or action, made or threatened by

Subsidiaries have ever been directly or indirectly sent, transferred,
transported to, treated, stored, or disposed of at any site listed or formally
proposed for listing on the National Priority List promulgated pursuant to

     Furthermore, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, except where the Company determines upon advice of counsel that
disclosure could result in the violation by the Company or Parent of state or
federal law, the Company shall confer on a regular basis with Parent concerning
operational matters, promptly advise Parent in writing of any change or event
that has or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of Parent and the
Company shall promptly provide the other (or its counsel) with copies of all

not in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).

     SECTION 6.2.  Agreements of Company's Affiliates.  The Company shall
identify in a letter to Parent, after consultation with counsel, all persons
who, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, it believes may be deemed
to be "affiliates" of the Company, as that term is defined for the purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Company
Affiliates"). The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each person
who is identified as a Company Affiliate in the letter referred to above to
deliver to Parent at least forty (40) days prior to the date of Closing an
executed copy of the Company Affiliates Agreement. Prior to the date of Closing,
the Company shall amend and supplement such letter and use all reasonable
efforts to cause each additional person who is identified as a Company Affiliate
as of the date of Closing to execute a copy of the Company Affiliates Agreement.

     SECTION 6.3.  Notice of Certain Events.  The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of:

          (a) any notice or other written communication from any Person alleging
     that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which consent if not
     obtained, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Company or which could reasonably be expected to affect materially and
     adversely the transactions contemplated hereby;

                                       A-28

          (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
     in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and

          (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
     commenced or, to Parent's or the Company's knowledge, as the case may be,
     threatened against, relating to or involving Parent or the Company which
     relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement or which, with respect to the Company, if pending on the date of
     this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
     Section 4.11.

     SECTION 6.4.  No Solicitation.

     (a) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents or affiliates (including, without limitation,
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by the Company), to directly or indirectly initiate,
solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance),
or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, provided,
however that prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, if the Board of
Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that the failure to proceed in accordance with clause
(i) and/or (ii) below of this Section 6.4(a) is reasonably likely to violate the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law,
the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.4(c), in response to an
unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person that the
Company's Board of Directors, after consultation with an independent nationally
recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, reasonably believes
could result in a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish information with respect to the
Company to such Person making such proposal after entering into a
confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms and conditions no less
favorable in any material respect to the Company than the terms and conditions
of the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 3, 2002 executed by
Parent and the Company together with the letter agreement dated as of January 8,
2003 between the Parent and the Company (collectively the "Parties'
Confidentiality Agreement") and (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; provided that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above,
the Company has provided not less than one full business day prior written
notice to Parent of its intention to proceed under such clause (i) or (ii)
above. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer,
employee, representative or agent of the Company or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative of the Company
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4(a) by the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean an inquiry, offer
or proposal regarding any of the following (other than the transactions among
the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary contemplated hereunder) involving the
Company: (A) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination or other similar transaction; (B) any sale, lease,
exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of the
assets of the Company, in a single transaction or series of transactions, (C)
any tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or purchase from the Company of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in
connection with any of the foregoing; or (D) any public announcement by the
Company of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any
agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

     (b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(b), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify,
or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner materially adverse to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or
any such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into
any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, if the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to proceed in accordance with
clause (A), (B) and/or (C) below of this Section 6.4(b) is reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary duties to the

                                       A-29

Company's stockholders under applicable law, the Board of Directors may (subject
to the terms of this sentence) (A) withdraw or modify its recommendation of the
Merger or this Agreement, (B) approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, or (C)
cause the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, in each case provided that the Company shall not take any of the
actions specified in such clauses (A), (B) or (C) unless the Parent shall have
received from the Company written notice specifying such actions to be taken no
later than 12:00 noon New York City time the business day prior to the date such
actions are proposed to be taken (a "Superior Proposal Notice").

     (c) The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that has the following characteristics: (i) it is a proposal to
acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
readily marketable securities, (A) shares of Company Common Stock representing
at least 80% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding Options, warrants and rights to purchase Company Common Stock, or
(B) substantially all the assets of the Company, (ii) the terms of such proposal
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with an independent nationally recognized financial advisor) are
more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger (after taking into account, if applicable, the payment of the
Expenses and the Termination Fee and any modifications to this Agreement
proposed by Parent), (iii) the transactions envisioned by such proposal, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation
with an independent nationally recognized financial advisor and the advice of
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated without
unreasonable delay or unusual conditions compared to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) financing for the proposed transaction,
to the extent required, has been committed in all material respects.

     (d) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.4(b), the Company
shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after the event) advise
Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal and of any request for
information which may relate to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, and the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Such
notification shall include, but shall not be limited to, the identity of the
party making such a proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent fully and
timely informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and will
promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after the event) notify Parent of
any determination by the Company's Board of Directors that a Superior Proposal
has been made. Following delivery of such notice to Parent, the Company shall
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent with respect to such changes as
the Company may propose to the terms of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company from
(x) making and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely
to constitute a violation of applicable law.
