                                   PROSPECTUS

                 PROPOSED MERGER -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     The board of directors of Chiles Offshore Inc. has unanimously approved the
merger of Chiles and ENSCO International Incorporated. Chiles believes that the
merger will create a stronger and more competitive offshore drilling company and
offer the best opportunity for you to maximize your investment in Chiles common
stock through ownership in the combined company.

     In the merger, you will receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO common stock and
$5.25 in cash for each share of Chiles common stock that you own. ENSCO
stockholders will continue to own their existing ENSCO shares. ENSCO will issue
approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock in the merger. Immediately
after the merger, former Chiles stockholders will own approximately 9% of the
outstanding shares of ENSCO common stock. ENSCO common stock trades on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ESV."

     In order to complete the merger, Chiles stockholders must vote to approve
and adopt the merger agreement. Chiles has scheduled a special meeting of its
stockholders to be held at 10:00 a.m., local time on                , 2002, at
the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, 25th Floor, New
York, New York 10153 to consider the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement. Only Chiles stockholders of record on the close of business on
               , 2002 will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Chiles common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The merger does
not require the vote by the ENSCO stockholders.

     The Chiles board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best
interests of its stockholders, and it unanimously recommends that the Chiles
stockholders vote "FOR" approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

     This proxy statement/prospectus provides detailed information about the
proposed merger. We encourage you to carefully read this entire document and the
documents incorporated by reference.

     SEE "RISK FACTORS" ON PAGE 17 FOR A DISCUSSION OF RISKS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
BEFORE VOTING AT THE SPECIAL MEETING.

     NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SHARES OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK TO BE
ISSUED IN THE MERGER OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

     THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS DATED                , 2002, AND IS
FIRST BEING MAILED TO CHILES STOCKHOLDERS ON OR ABOUT                , 2002.

To Our Stockholders:

     rights are asserted in strict accordance with Delaware law) will be
     converted into the right to receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO International
     Incorporated common stock and $5.25 in cash, conditional upon the
     completion of the merger.

     Only stockholders of record of shares of Chiles common stock at the close

the meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Chiles common stock entitled to vote at the meeting is
required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT!
THE FAILURE TO CAST YOUR VOTE WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING AGAINST THE
APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. Please complete, sign, date and
return the enclosed proxy, whether or not you expect to attend the meeting, so
that your shares may be represented at the meeting if you are unable to attend
and vote in person. If you attend the meeting, you may revoke your proxy and
vote your shares in person.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS?

     The Chiles board of directors has agreed to the acquisition of Chiles by
ENSCO under the terms of a merger agreement that is described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. After the merger, stockholders of Chiles will
become stockholders of ENSCO.

     You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because Chiles
stockholders must vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement in order to
complete the merger. Chiles will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to
vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. This proxy statement/
prospectus contains important information about the merger and the special
meeting of the Chiles stockholders, and you should read it carefully. The
enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your shares of Chiles common stock
without attending the Chiles special meeting.

     YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT! THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENCOURAGES YOU TO
VOTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WHY IS CHILES PROPOSING THE MERGER?

     The Chiles board of directors has unanimously determined that the terms of
the proposed merger and related transactions are in the best interests of Chiles
and its stockholders. The Chiles board of directors is proposing the merger
because it believes that the merger will create a stronger and more competitive
offshore drilling company and offer the best opportunity for you to maximize
your investment in Chiles common stock through ownership in the combined
company. The Chiles board of directors believes that merging with ENSCO will,
among other things:

     - position Chiles to compete more effectively in the consolidating offshore
       drilling industry by making Chiles part of a much larger and more
       diversified company able to compete in markets in which Chiles could not
       effectively compete given its smaller asset base. The Chiles board of
       directors believes that the merger will provide the combined company with
       opportunities to achieve greater economies of scale, access to capital
       markets and operating efficiencies;

     - provide the opportunity for Chiles stockholders to benefit from greater
       liquidity of their investment by owning ENSCO common stock because the
       average trading volume of ENSCO common stock far exceeds that of Chiles
       common stock; and

     - provide Chiles stockholders with a substantial premium to Chiles'
       historical stock price in a transaction that will be at least partly
       tax-free to Chiles stockholders. In the merger, Chiles stockholders will
       receive cash and ENSCO common stock with an aggregate value representing
       a premium of approximately 18.8%, based upon Chiles and ENSCO common
       stock closing price, on the day before the merger was first publicly
       announced. The Chiles board of directors believes that the merger
       represents the most favorable terms available.

     To review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, see "The
Merger -- Reasons for the Merger" on page 32.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

     Chiles will merge into a new subsidiary of ENSCO. Only this new subsidiary
will exist after the merger and will continue as a 100% owned subsidiary of
ENSCO. After completion of the merger, ENSCO will operate the combined
businesses of ENSCO and Chiles. You will receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO common
stock and $5.25 in cash for each share of Chiles common stock that you own
(unless you validly assert your appraisal rights in strict accordance with
Delaware law). ENSCO will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Instead,
ENSCO will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares. We sometimes refer to the
ENSCO shares and cash to be received by the Chiles stockholders as the merger
consideration. Based on the number of shares of ENSCO and Chiles common stock
outstanding on

, 2002, the record date for the Chiles special meeting, ENSCO will issue
approximately 13.3 million shares of ENSCO common stock in the merger.
Immediately after the merger, the former Chiles stockholders will own
approximately 9% of the then-outstanding shares of ENSCO common stock.

     Example: If you currently own 100 shares of Chiles common stock, as a
     result of the merger you will receive 65 shares of ENSCO common stock, $525
     in cash, and cash in lieu of 0.75 ENSCO shares calculated on the basis of
     the closing price of ENSCO common stock on the effective date of the
     merger.

WHERE WILL MY SHARES BE LISTED AFTER THE MERGER?

     The shares of ENSCO common stock issued in the merger will be listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and will trade under ENSCO's ticker symbol "ESV."

WHO WILL SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ENSCO AFTER THE MERGER?

     The current board of directors of ENSCO will continue to serve on the board
of directors of ENSCO after the merger. The current board of directors consists
of the following persons: Carl F. Thorne (Chairman of the Board), David M.
Carmichael, Gerald W. Haddock, Thomas L. Kelly II, Morton H. Meyerson, Paul E.
Rowsey, III and Joel V. Staff. No current member of the board of directors of
Chiles will serve on the board of directors of ENSCO after the merger.

WHO WILL BE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF ENSCO AFTER THE MERGER?

     The current executive officers of ENSCO will continue to serve as executive
officers of ENSCO after the merger. William E. Chiles, the President, Chief
Executive Officer and a director of Chiles, has been offered the position of
Vice President of ENSCO at the effective time of the merger. Mr. Chiles has
indicated that he intends to accept the offer. Other than Mr. Chiles, no current
executive officer of Chiles will be offered a position as an executive officer
of ENSCO after the merger; however, certain of these individuals may accept
employment with ENSCO other than as executive officers.

ARE THERE ANY U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO CHILES
STOCKHOLDERS?

     You will generally recognize gain, but not loss, equal to the lesser of:

     - the amount of cash you receive in the merger; or

     - the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the amount of cash
       and the fair market value of ENSCO common stock you receive in the merger
       over the adjusted tax basis of your Chiles common stock.

THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENCOURAGES YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR FOR A
FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

WHERE AND WHEN IS THE SPECIAL MEETING?

     The special meeting of the Chiles stockholders will take place at the
offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, 25th Floor, New York,
New York, on           ,           , 2002, at 10:00 a.m., local time.

WHAT VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT?

     The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Chiles common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is
required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT! If
you do not vote, this will have the same affect as a vote against the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement.

     No vote of ENSCO stockholders is required under applicable law.

HOW DOES THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE?

     The Chiles board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR"
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

HOW DO I CAST MY VOTE?

     If you are a Chiles stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the
special meeting or by submitting a proxy for the special meeting. You can submit
your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card
in the accompanying pre-addressed postage paid envelope.

     If you hold your shares in "street name," which means your shares are held
of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you must provide the record holder of
your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank, or
nominee will not be able to vote your shares unless the broker, bank or nominee
receives specific instructions from you.

     THE FAILURE TO CAST YOUR VOTE WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING AGAINST
THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY?

     Yes. If you are a Chiles stockholder of record, you can change your vote at
any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting by:

     - delivering to the Secretary of Chiles a signed notice of revocation;

     - granting a new, later-dated proxy, signed and delivered to the Secretary
       of Chiles; or

     - attending the special meeting and voting in person; however, your
       attendance alone will not revoke your proxy.

     If your shares are held in "street name," you must contact your broker,
bank or other nominee to change your vote.

SHOULD I SEND IN MY CHILES STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

     No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions
from the exchange agent on how to exchange your Chiles stock certificates for
the merger consideration. Please do not send in your Chiles stock certificates
with your proxy.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VOTING MATERIALS?

     You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple
copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each
brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a Chiles stockholder of
record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive
more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card
and voting instruction card that you receive.

WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

     We are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable. We
currently expect that the merger will be completed during the third calendar
quarter of 2002.

WHAT RIGHTS DO I HAVE TO SEEK A VALUATION OF MY SHARES OF CHILES COMMON STOCK?

     You may assert appraisal rights under Delaware law and receive a cash
payment for the fair value of your shares instead of the cash and shares of
ENSCO common stock to be received in the merger. You can assert these rights
only if you comply with all of the requirements of Delaware law provided in

Annex G of this proxy statement/prospectus. If you elect to assert your
appraisal rights under Delaware law, a Delaware court will determine the fair
value of your shares. The fair value determined by the court may be more than,
less than or equal to the value of the merger consideration. For a more complete
description of your appraisal rights, see "Appraisal Rights" on page 86.

     ENSCO is not obligated to complete the merger if appraisal rights are
properly demanded, and such demands are not withdrawn as of the date the merger
is to be completed, for more than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Chiles common stock.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 29)

     The Chiles board of directors has agreed to the acquisition of Chiles by

of ENSCO common stock and $5.25 in cash for each share of Chiles common stock
owned by you, unless you elect to assert your appraisal rights. ENSCO will not
deliver fractional shares in the merger. Instead, ENSCO will pay cash for any
fractional shares. We sometimes refer to the ENSCO shares and cash to be
received by the Chiles stockholders as the merger consideration.

     ENSCO stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of ENSCO
common stock.

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Chiles' financial advisor, has
delivered a written opinion to the Chiles board of directors as to the fairness,

limitations on the review undertaken. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION'S
OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 33)

     The Chiles board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the
related transactions, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Chiles and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends
that Chiles stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

CHILES STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE; VOTE REQUIRED (SEE PAGE 26)

     You can vote at the Chiles special meeting if you owned Chiles common stock
at the close of business on                , 2002, the record date for the
Chiles special meeting. On that date, there were           shares of Chiles
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. You can cast one vote for each
share of Chiles common stock that you owned on that date. Approval and adoption
of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
66 2/3% (or           shares) of the outstanding shares of Chiles common stock
entitled to vote.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 68)

     ENSCO has entered into separate voting agreements with each of Luis Alvarez
Morphy, Javier Alvarez Morphy, Patricio Alvarez Morphy and SEACOR SMIT Inc.
(which we refer to as SEACOR) pursuant to which these persons agreed, among
other things, to vote all of the shares of Chiles common stock owned by them in
favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. These persons also

granted to certain executive officers of ENSCO an irrevocable proxy to vote
their shares of Chiles in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the related transactions as directed by ENSCO. As of the record
date, these persons owned 7,511,071 shares of Chiles common stock, representing
approximately 37.0% of the outstanding shares of Chiles common stock on that
date. See "The Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons; Possible Conflicts of
Interest of Certain Persons in the Merger" on page 46.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS; POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS
IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 46)

     When considering the Chiles board of directors' recommendation that you
vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, you should
be aware that certain members of the board of directors and executive officers
of Chiles have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, their interests as Chiles stockholders. These conflicts include the
following:

     - Affiliates of certain directors and executive officers of Chiles have
       various agreements with Chiles that will be terminated at the effective
       time of the merger. Certain of these affiliates of directors and
       executive officers of Chiles will receive payments from ENSCO at the
       effective time of the merger or shortly thereafter to terminate these
       agreements.

     - Certain executive officers of Chiles will receive bonuses, severance
       and/or other employment benefits under existing agreements with Chiles
       and other benefits adopted in connection with the merger agreement.

     - Certain directors and executive officers of Chiles hold options to
       purchase shares of Chiles common stock pursuant to the Chiles 2000 Stock
       Option Plan. Under the terms of this plan, the vesting of all Chiles
       options will accelerate and become immediately vested as a result of the
       merger.

     The board of directors of Chiles was aware of these arrangements during its
deliberations on the merits of the merger and in deciding to recommend that you
vote for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CHILES (SEE PAGE 50)

     At the close of business on                , 2002, directors and executive
officers of Chiles and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote
7,403,033 shares of Chiles common stock, collectively representing approximately
36.5% of the outstanding shares of Chiles common stock on that date.

OWNERSHIP OF ENSCO BY CHILES STOCKHOLDERS AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 50)

     ENSCO expects to issue approximately 13.3 million shares of ENSCO common
stock in the merger. Based on the number of shares of ENSCO and Chiles common
stock outstanding on the record date, after completion of the merger, former
Chiles stockholders will own approximately 9% of the then-outstanding shares of
ENSCO common stock.

MANAGEMENT OF ENSCO AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 51)

     Upon completion of the merger, the current board of directors and executive
officers of ENSCO will continue to manage the business of ENSCO, including the
business now conducted by Chiles and its subsidiaries. None of the current
directors of Chiles will be a director of ENSCO after the merger. William E.
Chiles, the President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of Chiles, has
been offered a position as Vice President of ENSCO effective at the time of the
merger. Mr. Chiles has indicated that he intends to accept the offer. Other than
Mr. Chiles, no current executive officer of Chiles will be offered a position as
an executive officer of ENSCO after the merger; however, certain of these
individuals may accept employment with ENSCO other than as executive officers.

LISTING OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK AND DELISTING OF CHILES COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE 45)

     The ENSCO common stock issued in the merger will be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, where ENSCO common stock is traded under the symbol "ESV." If
the merger is completed, Chiles common stock will no longer be listed on the
American Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and Chiles will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 86)

     You have the right under Delaware law to dissent from the merger and to
receive payment in cash for the appraised fair value of your shares of Chiles
common stock instead of the merger consideration. You can assert these rights
only if you comply with all of the requirements of Delaware law provided in
Annex G of this proxy statement/prospectus. If you elect to assert your
appraisal rights under Delaware law, a Delaware court will determine the fair
value of your shares. The appraised value of your shares of Chiles common stock
may be more than, less than or equal to the value of the merger consideration.
If you desire to assert your statutory appraisal rights you must:

     - deliver to Chiles before the special meeting written notice of your
       intent to exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Chiles
       common stock if the merger is completed;

     - not vote your shares in favor of approval and adoption of the merger
       agreement; and

     - follow the statutory procedures for asserting appraisal rights under
       Delaware law, which are described in the section entitled "Appraisal
       Rights" on page 86.

     Merely voting against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement
will not preserve your appraisal rights. Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (which we refer to as the DGCL) is reprinted in its entirety and
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G. Failure to strictly
comply with all procedures required by the DGCL may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights.

     ENSCO is not obligated to complete the merger if appraisal rights are
properly demanded, and such demands are not withdrawn as of the date the merger
is to be completed, for more than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Chiles common stock.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 53)

     Completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met or
waived, including:

     - approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the Chiles stockholders;

     - absence of breaches of the representations and warranties in the merger
       agreement that result in a material adverse effect;

     - material performance of each party's obligations and covenants under the
       merger agreement;

     - absence of certain types of governmental orders or proceedings;

     - receipt of opinions by ENSCO and Chiles from their respective tax counsel
       that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) the
       Internal Revenue Code;

     - the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976;

     - absence of any event or occurrence that has or is reasonably expected to
       have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect (which,
       in the case of Chiles, includes the loss or total destruction of any of
       Chiles' drilling rigs); and

     - approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange the shares of ENSCO
       common stock to be issued in the merger.

     In addition, ENSCO is not obligated to complete the merger if appraisal
rights are properly demanded, and such demands are not withdrawn as of the date
the merger is to be completed, for more than 10% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Chiles common stock.

     A party may elect to waive a condition to its obligation to complete the
merger even though that condition has not been satisfied.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 64)

     The merger agreement may be terminated in the following ways:

     - by mutual written consent;

     - by ENSCO if:

      - the Chiles board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval of the
        merger in any manner adverse to ENSCO;

      - the Chiles board of directors recommends the acquisition proposal of a
        person other than ENSCO; or

      - another person makes a tender or exchange offer for Chiles and the
        Chiles board of directors fails to recommend to the Chiles stockholders
        that they reject the tender or exchange offer; and

     - by Chiles, if the Chiles board of directors accepts an acquisition
       proposal from a third party that is more favorable to Chiles
       stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the terms of the
       merger and complies with certain procedures contained in the merger
       agreement.

     In addition, either Chiles or ENSCO could decide, without the consent of
the other, to terminate the merger agreement in a number of situations
including, if:

     - the merger is not completed by December 15, 2002;

     - a court or governmental authority permanently prohibits completion of the
       merger;

     - the Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement at
       the special meeting;

     - the representations and warranties of the other become inaccurate after
       the date of the merger agreement, the inaccuracy has not been cured
       within a specified time and such breaches have a material adverse effect;
       or

     - since the date of the merger agreement, an event has had or is reasonably
       likely to have, alone or together with all other events, a material
       adverse effect on either party (which, in the case of Chiles, includes
       the loss or total destruction of any of Chiles' drilling rigs existing or
       under construction).

NO SOLICITATION BY CHILES (SEE PAGE 57)

     The merger agreement restricts the ability of Chiles to solicit or engage
in discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding a proposal to
acquire a significant interest in Chiles. However, the merger agreement provides
that, if Chiles receives an acquisition proposal from a third party that is more
favorable to Chiles stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the terms
of the merger and Chiles complies with certain procedures contained in the
merger agreement, Chiles may furnish nonpublic information to that third party
and engage in negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal with that third
party, subject to certain conditions.

TERMINATION FEE AND EXPENSES (SEE PAGES 65 AND 66)

     If the merger agreement is terminated, Chiles, in specified circumstances,
may be required to pay a termination fee of $22.5 million to ENSCO or to
reimburse up to $1 million of ENSCO's expenses.

CHILES STOCK OPTIONS (SEE PAGE 53)

     Upon completion of the merger, each option issued by Chiles to purchase
shares of Chiles common stock will be assumed by ENSCO and converted into an
option exercisable for the merger consideration. The vesting of Chiles options
will accelerate and all of such options will generally become immediately vested
as a result of the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE
42)

     We expect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition to the merger that ENSCO
and Chiles receive opinions from their respective tax counsel to the effect that
the merger will qualify for this tax treatment. If the merger qualifies as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, then you will
generally recognize gain, but not loss, equal to the lesser of:

     - the amount of cash you receive in the merger; or

     - the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the amount of cash
       and the fair market value of ENSCO common stock you receive in the merger
       over the adjusted tax basis of your Chiles common stock.

     No gain or loss will be recognized by ENSCO, Chore Acquisition, Inc. or
Chiles as a result of the merger.

     The tax consequences of the merger to you may depend on the facts of your
own situation. THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENCOURAGES YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX
ADVISOR FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 45)

     ENSCO will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations under generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE 42)

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, we cannot
complete the merger until we have notified the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission of the merger and
filed the necessary report forms and until the required waiting period has
ended. ENSCO and Chiles submitted the required filings on May 23 and 24, 2002,
respectively.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     We have included the following selected unaudited pro forma combined
financial data only for the purposes of illustration. The unaudited pro forma
combined statement of operations data assumes that the merger between ENSCO and
Chiles was completed on January 1, 2001 and the unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet data assumes that the merger was completed on March 31, 2002. The
pro forma financial data do not necessarily indicate what the operating results
or financial position would have been if the merger had been completed at the
dates indicated. Furthermore, this data does not necessarily indicate what the
future operating results or financial position of the combined company will be.
This unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations data does not include
adjustments to reflect any cost savings or other operational efficiencies that
may be realized as a result of the merger of ENSCO and Chiles, or any future
merger-related restructuring or integration expenses.

     You should read this selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data

    by ENSCO will be dependent on, among other things, ENSCO's profitability,
    liquidity, financial condition and capital requirements. Final determination
    of the timing, amount and payment of dividends on ENSCO common stock is at
    the discretion of its board of directors.

(1) The prices of Chiles common stock are reported beginning at the first full
    quarter after the initial listing of such stock on the American Stock
    Exchange.

(2) The prices of ENSCO and Chiles common stock are reported through May 14,
    2002, the date preceding the public announcement of the merger.

     On May 14, 2002, the last trading day before we announced the merger, the
closing price of ENSCO common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $35.36
per share and the closing price of Chiles common stock on the American Stock
Exchange was $23.99 per share. Based on the exchange ratio 0.6575 of a share of
ENSCO common stock for each outstanding share of Chiles common stock, the
closing price of ENSCO common stock on May 14, 2002, and the cash consideration
of $5.25 per share, the pro forma equivalent per share value of Chiles common
stock on May 14, 2002 was approximately $28.50 per share. Based on the exchange
ratio 0.6575 of a share of ENSCO common stock for each outstanding share of
Chiles common stock, the closing price of ENSCO common stock on           ,
2002, and the cash consideration of $5.25 per share, the pro forma equivalent
per share value of Chiles common stock on           , 2002 was approximately
$     per share.

     The market value of the shares of ENSCO common stock that will be issued in
exchange for shares of Chiles common stock upon the completion of the merger
will not be known at the time Chiles stockholders vote on the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement because the merger will not yet be completed at
that time. The above table shows only historical comparisons. Because the market
prices of ENSCO common stock and Chiles common stock will likely fluctuate prior
to the merger, these comparisons may not provide meaningful information to you
in determining whether to approve and adopt the merger agreement. You should
obtain current market quotations for ENSCO and Chiles common stock and review
carefully the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in considering
whether to approve and adopt the merger agreement. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 89.

     ENSCO initiated the payment of a $.025 per share quarterly cash dividend on
its common stock during the third quarter of 1997 and has continued to pay such
quarterly dividends through March 31, 2002. Cash dividends totaling $.10 per
share were paid in both 2001 and 2000. On May 14, 2002, ENSCO's board of
directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.025 per share payable on
June 18, 2002 to stockholders of record on June 4, 2002. ENSCO currently does
not plan to change its dividend policy after the merger (including the amount of
the per share dividend payments). However, the final determination of the
timing, amount and payment of dividends on the common stock is at the discretion
of the ENSCO board of directors. Such decisions on payment of dividends will
depend on, among other things, ENSCO's profitability, liquidity, financial
condition and capital requirements. Since its inception in 1997, Chiles has not
paid any dividends to Chiles stockholders (or, prior to becoming a corporation
in September 2000, any distributions to Chiles members) and its current
intention is to retain all cash generated from operations. In addition, certain
covenants in Chiles' credit facilities as well as the merger agreement restrict
Chiles' ability to pay dividends. Chiles does not anticipate paying any cash
dividends on its common stock prior to the effective time of the merger.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward -- Looking Statement" on page 24, you should carefully
consider the following risks before deciding whether to vote for approval and
adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, you should read and consider the
risks associated with each of the businesses of ENSCO and Chiles because these
risks will also affect the combined company. You can find descriptions of these
risks in ENSCO's and Chiles' annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and the other reports filed with the SEC and incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to ENSCO and Chiles or that are not currently
believed to be important to you also may adversely affect the merger and ENSCO
following the merger.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

THE VALUE OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY YOU IN THE MERGER WILL
FLUCTUATE.

     In the merger, you will receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO common stock and
$5.25 in cash for each share of Chiles common stock you own. Because part of the
merger consideration you will receive consists of ENSCO common stock, the value
of this merger consideration will depend on the market price of ENSCO common
stock at the time the merger is completed. The market price of ENSCO common
stock at the time the merger is completed will vary from its market prices at
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and at the date of the Chiles
special meeting. These variations may be caused by a number of factors,
including:

     - general industry market conditions;

     - changes in the business or results of operations of ENSCO or Chiles;

     - the timing of the merger and the prospects for the post-merger operations
       of ENSCO;

     - the worldwide supply/demand balance for oil and natural gas and the
       prevailing commodity price environment;

     - the level of drilling activity of ENSCO's and Chiles' customers;

     - competition in the drilling industry;

     - regulatory considerations;

     - risks associated with ENSCO's construction of new rigs, including the
       Chiles drilling rig under construction;

     - escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crisis in
       the Middle East or other geographic areas in which ENSCO or Chiles
       operate or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;

     - general stock market and economic conditions; and

     - other factors beyond the control of ENSCO and Chiles, including those
       described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section.

     The merger consideration will not be adjusted for any increase or decrease
in the market price of ENSCO common stock or Chiles common stock. Accordingly,
if the market value of ENSCO common stock declines prior to the time the merger
is completed, the value of the merger consideration to be received by you will
decline. In addition, because the date that the merger is completed will be
later than the date of the special meeting, you will not know the exact value of
the ENSCO common stock that will be issued in the merger at the time they vote
on the merger agreement. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS
FOR ENSCO AND CHILES SHARES.

THE PRICE OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

     Assuming the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the Chiles
stockholders and the merger is completed, the number of outstanding shares of
ENSCO common stock will be increased by approximately 9% from the number of
outstanding shares of ENSCO common stock immediately prior to the completion of
the merger. As a result of the issuance of these additional shares, the market
price of shares of ENSCO common stock prior to the completion of the merger or
the shares of ENSCO common stock following completion of the merger may
experience volatility or declines unrelated to the financial performance of
ENSCO.

ENSCO MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of ENSCO to
realize cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the business of
Chiles with the business of ENSCO. Any success by ENSCO in realizing these
benefits and the timing of this realization, if any, depend upon the successful
integration of the operations of Chiles into ENSCO. The integration of two
independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The
difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:

     - retaining key employees;

     - transitioning and preserving Chiles' customer, contractor, supplier and
       other important third party relationships;

     - integrating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

     - coordinating sales and marketing functions;

     - minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business
       concerns; and

     - coordinating geographically separate organizations.

RISKS RELATING TO ENSCO'S BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     The following risks relate to ENSCO's business after the merger taking into
account the combined businesses of Chiles and ENSCO.

RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AND UNITED STATES MILITARY ACTION COULD RESULT IN A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS OF ENSCO.

     Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage to or disruption of ENSCO's
United States or international operations, its employees, its property and
equipment, or its customers, suppliers and subcontractors, which could
significantly impact ENSCO's financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. The terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11,
2001 were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political
uncertainties. The long-term effects on ENSCO's operations of the September 11,
2001 attacks are unknown. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the
national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war
or hostility could create many economic and political uncertainties, including
an impact upon oil and gas exploration and development, which could adversely
affect ENSCO's business in ways that cannot be readily determined.

THE SUCCESS OF ENSCO'S BUSINESS WILL DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE OIL
AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL AND
VOLATILITY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES.

     The success of ENSCO's business will depend on the level of activity in
offshore and onshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production
in markets worldwide. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of
potential changes in these prices, significantly affect this level of activity.
ENSCO's business and operations depend upon exploration and development spending
by oil and gas companies. An actual decline, or the perceived risk of a decline,
in oil or natural gas prices could cause oil and gas

companies to reduce their overall level of spending, in which case demand for
ENSCO's equipment and services may decrease and revenues may be adversely
affected through lower offshore rig and marine transportation utilization and
lower average day rates. Worldwide military, political and economic events have
also contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to
continue to do so in the future. Numerous factors may affect oil and natural gas
prices and the level of demand for ENSCO's services, including:

     - worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;

     - the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (which
       we refer to as OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;

     - the level of production by non-OPEC countries;

     - domestic and foreign tax policy;

     - laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and
       development of oil and natural gas in various jurisdictions;

     - advances in exploration and development technology; and

     - the worldwide military or political environment, including uncertainty or
       instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed
       hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas of the
       Middle East or geographic areas in which ENSCO or Chiles operate, or
       further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere.

ENSCO'S BUSINESS IS AND WILL BE HIGHLY PRICE COMPETITIVE AND CYCLICAL, WITH
PERIODS OF LOW DEMAND AND EXCESS RIG AND VESSEL AVAILABILITY THAT COULD RESULT
IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ENSCO'S BUSINESS.

     The offshore drilling and marine transportation businesses are highly
competitive with numerous industry participants. The industry has experienced
consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation.
Furthermore, recent mergers among oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies have reduced the number of available customers.

     Drilling and marine transportation contracts are, for the most part,
awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price competition is often the primary
factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract, although
rig and vessel availability and the quality and technical capability of service
and equipment are also factors. ENSCO will compete with numerous offshore
drilling and marine transportation contractors, several of which are larger and
have greater resources than ENSCO.

     ENSCO conducts its business primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North
Sea, Asia Pacific and Venezuela. ENSCO's industry historically has been cyclical
and may be impacted by oil and natural gas price levels and volatility. There
have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high day rates, followed
by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low day rates. Changes in
commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on the demand for rigs and vessels,
and periods of excess rig and vessel supply intensify the competition in the
industry and often result in rigs and vessels being idled. Decreases in U.S.
natural gas prices since the beginning of the second quarter of 2001 have
decreased the demand for rigs, vessels and day rates in the Gulf of Mexico, a
predominantly natural gas province in which ENSCO has significant operations, as
operators have reduced their level of spending activity. Further declines in oil
or natural gas prices could reduce demand for ENSCO's drilling services and
adversely affect both utilization and day rates in one or more of the regions in
which it will operate. ENSCO may be required to idle rigs and vessels or to
enter into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the future.

     There can be no assurance that the active rig count, vessel utilization or
drilling activity in the areas in which ENSCO operates will not decline in 2002
or in other periods, nor can there be any assurance concerning any adverse
effect resulting from such decrease in activity.

FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD IMPEDE ENSCO'S OPERATIONS.

     ENSCO requires highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical
services and support for its business. Competition for the skilled and other
labor required for drilling operations has intensified as the number of rigs
activated or added to worldwide fleets or under construction has increased in
the last few years. Although competition for skilled and other labor has not
materially affected ENSCO or Chiles to date, both companies have recently found
it more difficult to find qualified individuals, and the possibility exists that
competition for skilled and other labor for operations could limit ENSCO's
results of operations in the future.

ENSCO MAY SUFFER LOSSES IF ITS CUSTOMERS TERMINATE OR SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR
CONTRACTS.

     ENSCO's contracts with customers may be cancelled upon specified notice at
the option of the customer. Some drilling contracts require the customer to pay
a specified early termination payment upon cancellation, which payments may not
fully compensate ENSCO for the loss of the contract. Contracts customarily
provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the
customer in the event of total loss of the drilling rig or if drilling
operations are suspended for extended periods of time by reason of acts of God
or excessive rig downtime for repairs, or other specified conditions. Early
termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period
of time. ENSCO's revenues may be adversely affected by customers' early
termination of contracts, especially if ENSCO is unable to recontract the
affected rig within a short period of time. Further, in times of depressed
market conditions, ENSCO's customers (and, historically, Chiles' customers) have
on occasion sought to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their
obligations.

ENSCO'S DRILLING RIG FLEET WILL BE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN PREMIUM JACKUP RIGS,
WHICH LEAVES ENSCO VULNERABLE TO RISKS RELATED TO LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION.

     The international offshore drilling fleet is generally divided into four
rig type market segments -- platform, jackup and semisubmersible drilling rigs
and drill ships. Each of the segments also is divided into smaller sub-markets.
While these market segments are affected by common characteristics, they each
have separate market conditions that affect the demand and rates for drilling
equipment in that segment. ENSCO's current complement of offshore drilling rigs
is comprised of 38 premium jackup rigs, seven barge rigs, five platform rigs and
one deepwater semisubmersible rig. Chiles' current rig fleet is comprised of
four premium jackup rigs and an premium jackup rig currently under construction.
Following the merger, ENSCO will have 43 premium jackup rigs (including the
Chiles rig under construction and a 25% owned rig for which ENSCO has a purchase
option on the remaining 75%) in its offshore rig fleet and will thus have a
heavy concentration of its fleet in the premium jack up rig market. If the
market for premium jackup rigs should decline relative to the markets for other
drilling rig types, ENSCO's results of operations could be more adversely
affected relative to its competitors which may have drilling fleets that are not
concentrated in premium jackup rigs.

SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS REQUIRE US TO TAKE A HIGHER DEGREE OF BUSINESS RISKS.

     During good industry market cycles ENSCO experiences higher utilization,
receives relatively high average day rates, and also generally is able to
negotiate more favorable contract terms. During adverse industry market cycles,
ENSCO competes more aggressively for contracts and may have to accept
contractual liability and indemnity provisions that do not offer the same level
of protection against potential losses as can be obtained during good industry
market cycles. Increased contractual liabilities may have an adverse effect on
results of operations, especially in respect of risks for which ENSCO is
uninsured or underinsured.

BECAUSE ENSCO RELIES HEAVILY ON A DECREASING NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, OUR BUSINESS
MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS CEASE TO DO BUSINESS
WITH ENSCO.

     ENSCO provides its services to major international oil and gas companies,
government-owned oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies.
However, the number of customers served by ENSCO has decreased in recent years
as a result of mergers among the major international oil companies. In addition,
while ENSCO has not experienced a significant impact as a result of industry
consolidation to date, the long-term impact on ENSCO's operations, if any, is
not determinable at this time. In the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, 26%, 29% and 25%, respectively, of ENSCO's consolidated revenue was
derived from two customers, ChevronTexaco Corporation (and its predecessor
entity) and ExxonMobil Corporation (and its predecessor entity). ENSCO's results
of operations may be materially adversely affected if either of those two
customers, terminates its contracts with ENSCO, fails to renew its existing
contracts with ENSCO or declines to award new contracts to ENSCO.

ENSCO'S BUSINESS INVOLVES NUMEROUS OPERATING HAZARDS AND IT WILL NOT BE FULLY
INSURED AGAINST ALL OF THESE HAZARDS.

     ENSCO's operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the
drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including blowouts, explosions, oil
spills and fires. Our operations are also subject to hazards peculiar to marine
activities, such as collision, grounding, and damage or loss from severe
weather. All of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe
damage to and destruction of property and equipment, well loss or damage,
uncontrolled wells, reservoir damage, pollution or environmental damage,
suspension of operations and wreck removal liabilities. We attempt to insure
against, or receive indemnification from customers for, some, but not all, of
these risks. Furthermore, our insurance contains various limitations on coverage
and deductibles.

     The occurrence of significant events, including a terrorist act, war, civil
disturbance, drilling rig or vessel loss, blowout, well loss or damage,
uncontrolled well, reservoir damage, pollution or environmental damage, not
fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its
indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect ENSCO's
operations and financial condition. Additionally, we are subjected to changes in
the insurance market. Consequently, no assurance can be made that ENSCO will
maintain its current insurance coverages in the future because of uncertainties
regarding future availability and/or cost of such insurance.

COMPLIANCE WITH OR BREACH OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CAN BE COSTLY AND COULD LIMIT
OUR OPERATIONS.

     Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations controlling the
discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up of,
or otherwise relating to, the protection of the environment. As a result, the
application of these laws could materially adversely affect our results of
operations by increasing our cost of doing business, discouraging our customers
from drilling for hydrocarbons or subjecting us to liability. As an operator of
mobile offshore drilling units and vessels in navigable United States waters and
some offshore areas, including the Outer Continental Shelf, we may be liable for
fines, damages and for the cost of removing oil spills for which we may be held
responsible. In addition, we may use or handle materials that may be classified
as environmentally hazardous substances in its operations. Laws and regulations
protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and, may in some
cases, impose "strict liability" for environmental damage. Strict liability
means that we may be held liable for damage without regard to whether it was
negligent or otherwise at fault. Environmental laws and regulations may expose
ENSCO to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts
that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were
performed.

     The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (which we refer to as OPA '90)
and similar legislation enacted in Texas, Louisiana and other coastal states
address oil spill prevention and control and significantly expand liability
exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry. OPA '90, such similar
legislation and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on ENSCO
related to the

prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from these spills.
OPA '90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability
upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and
private damages. OPA '90 also imposes ongoing financial responsibility
requirements on a responsible party. A failure to comply with ongoing
requirements or inadequate cooperation in a spill may subject a responsible
party, including in some cases ENSCO, to civil or criminal enforcement action.

ENSCO'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH
DOMESTIC OPERATIONS.

     Risks associated with ENSCO's international operations, any of which could
limit or disrupt our markets or operations, include risks of:

     - foreign terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;

     - expropriation or nationalization of assets;

     - assaults on property or personnel;

     - foreign exchange restrictions;

     - foreign currency fluctuations;

     - foreign taxation;

     - limitations on the ability to repatriate income or capital to the United
       States;

     - changing local and international political conditions; and

     - foreign and domestic monetary policies.

     Additionally, our ability to compete in international drilling markets may
be adversely affected by foreign government regulations favoring or requiring
the award of drilling contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign
contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular
jurisdiction. Furthermore, foreign government regulations that may become
applicable to the oil and natural gas industry in the future, could reduce
demand for ENSCO's services or could directly affect ENSCO's ability to compete
for customers.

LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY ADD TO COSTS OR LIMIT ENSCO'S DRILLING OR
MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITY.

     ENSCO's business will be affected by changes in public policy and by
federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the energy
industry. The drilling and marine transportation industries are dependent on
demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration industry and,
accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws
and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and
natural gas for economic, environmental and other policy reasons. Furthermore,
we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with
governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and
regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or may
significantly limit drilling activity.

     Some foreign governments have become increasingly active in regulating and
controlling the ownership of concessions, companies holding concessions, the
exploration of oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas
companies operating in these countries. In some areas of the world, this
governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and
development work done by major oil companies and may continue to do so.

RISKS RELATED TO OWNING SHARES OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK

THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON YOUR OWNERSHIP OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK IF YOU ARE A
NON-U.S. CITIZEN.

     ENSCO, as owner of certain United States flag vessels, is subject to the
Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as amended, which requires that at least seventy-five
percent of ENSCO's stock be owned by U.S. citizens

if ENSCO is to continue to own these vessels and operate them in coastwise
trade. Therefore, ownership and control of ENSCO common stock by non-U.S.
citizens is limited by the terms of the ENSCO certificate of incorporation.
Under certain circumstances, transfers of ENSCO common stock to non-U.S.
citizens may be void and certain ENSCO common stock owned by non-U.S. citizens
may not be permitted to vote or receive dividends. See "Comparisons of
Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance Matters -- Restrictions on Ownership
by Non-U.S. Citizens" on page 85.

AS HOLDERS OF SHARES OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK, YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS.

     ENSCO has approved and adopted a rights agreement, which may make an
unsolicited acquisition of ENSCO more difficult or expensive. ENSCO is also
subject to Section 203 of the DGCL which prohibits certain "business
combinations" with an interested stockholder that beneficially owns 15% or more
of a corporation's voting stock, within three years after the person becomes an
interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions. See "Comparisons of
Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance Matters -- Stockholder Rights Plan"
on page 84 and "-- Certain Business Combination Restrictions" on page 84.

     In addition, the ENSCO board of directors is divided into three classes of
directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term. This
classification is intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability
in the composition of the ENSCO board of directors and in the policies
formulated by it, and may have the effect of discouraging actual or threatened
changes of control of ENSCO. See "Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate
Governance Matters -- Classification of Board of Directors" on page 79.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Chiles board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the
related transactions, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Chiles and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends
that Chiles stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

VOTING POWER

     As of the record date, there were 100,000,000 shares of Chiles common stock
authorized, of which           were outstanding and entitled to vote. Chiles has
no other voting securities issued or outstanding. Each stockholder as of the
record date will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held by
them on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the special
meeting, and may vote in person or by proxy authorized in writing.

     A list of Chiles stockholders as of the record date for the special meeting
will be available for examination by any stockholder, for purposes germane to
the special meeting, during ordinary business hours, for 10 days prior to the
date of the special meeting, at 11200 Richmond Avenue, Suite 490, Houston, Texas
77082-2618.

QUORUM

     Attendance at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, by
the holders of a majority of all shares of Chiles common stock issued,
outstanding and entitled to vote constitutes a quorum.

REQUIRED VOTING

     The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
shares of Chiles common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting
(          shares) is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

PROXIES

     Stockholders of record are requested to complete, date, sign and promptly
return the accompanying proxy in the enclosed postage-paid, self-addressed
envelope provided for such purpose. Common stock represented by properly
executed proxies that are received by Chiles and not subsequently revoked will
be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained
therein. If instructions are not given, signed and submitted proxies will be
voted "FOR" the proposal set forth in this proxy statement/ prospectus and
listed on the enclosed proxy.

     A stockholder of record who so desires, may revoke such stockholder's proxy
at any time before it is exercised by (a) providing written notice to such
effect to the Secretary of Chiles, (b) duly executing a proxy bearing a date
subsequent to that of a previously furnished proxy, or (c) attending the special
meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in
itself constitute a revocation of a previously furnished proxy. Stockholders who
attend the special meeting in person need not revoke their proxy (if previously
furnished) and vote in person.

     If you hold your shares in "street name," which means your shares are held
of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you must provide the record holder of
your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank, or
nominee will not be able to vote your shares unless the broker, bank or nominee
receives specific instructions from you. If your shares are held in a street
name account, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your
vote.

ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as votes "Against" a
proposal, but will count towards the determination of a quorum at the special
meeting.

SOLICITATION

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, ENSCO and Chiles will share equally the
costs of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to
solicitation by mail, directors, officers and regular employees of Chiles may
solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, telegram, e-mail, personal
interview or other means. ENSCO and Chiles currently expect not to incur any
costs beyond those customarily expended for a solicitation of proxies in
connection with a merger agreement. Directors, officers and employees will not
receive additional compensation for their solicitation activities, but may be
reimbursed for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
therewith. Brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies, fiduciaries,
custodians and other nominees have been requested to forward proxy solicitation
materials to their customers and such nominees will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out of pocket expenses. Chiles has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to
solicit proxies and to distribute proxy materials to various nominees who are
stockholders of record of Chiles common stock. For such services, D.F. King &
Co., Inc. will receive a fee of approximately $7,000, reimbursement for certain
out of pocket expenses and indemnification by ENSCO and Chiles against certain
losses.

merger, the description may not contain all of the information important to you.
We encourage you to read carefully this entire proxy statement/prospectus,

GENERAL

     The Chiles board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement. At the effective time of the merger, Chiles will merge with Chore
Acquisition, Inc., a new subsidiary of ENSCO. Only Chore Acquisition, Inc. will
exist after the merger and will continue to exist as a 100% owned subsidiary of
ENSCO under the name Chiles Offshore Inc. In the merger, Chiles stockholders
will receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO common stock and $5.25 in cash for each
share of Chiles common stock they own, with cash paid instead of fractional
shares (other than stockholders who validly perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with Delaware law). The cash portion of the merger consideration is
expected to be paid out of ENSCO's existing funds or cash provided by operating
activities or a combination of these sources. ENSCO may issue an additional
               shares of common stock as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and pay cash upon the exercise of outstanding Chiles stock
options.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     The offshore drilling industry has undergone increasing consolidation over
the last several years. The competitive advantages that could result from
combining drilling operators has contributed to this trend. These include
efficiencies as a consequence of combined operations, an ability to better serve
existing customers and an ability to serve additional markets. The managements
of ENSCO and Chiles have from time to time reviewed their respective business
strategies and considered possible alternatives with the principal objectives of
increasing their competitive positions, enhancing stockholder value and meeting
the global needs of their customers. In this regard, ENSCO was particularly
interested in a combination which would enhance its drilling rig fleet with
premium equipment. Chiles, in turn, was prepared to consider strategic
consolidation opportunities with other offshore drilling contractors,
particularly larger contractors operating premium equipment and maintaining high
safety and performance standards, with a view toward achieving economies of
scale, the benefits of a larger global rig fleet, greater financial strength and
increased liquidity for its stockholders.

     As Chiles' presence in the industry became more established, its principals
began to receive indications of possible interest in business combinations from
certain of its competitors and suggestions with respect to potential business
combinations from representatives of investment banking firms. In this regard,
Charles Fabrikant, Chiles' Chairman, and William E. Chiles, Chiles' Chief
Executive Officer, engaged in general discussions over the past year with
representatives of several of Chiles' competitors (in addition to ENSCO)
concerning possible merger opportunities. Discussions with representatives of
one such competitor continued until the first week of May 2002 when it appeared
that no firm proposal from this competitor would be forthcoming and, as
discussed below, it appeared that Chiles and ENSCO might agree upon acceptable
terms for a merger. A chronology of the principal contacts, discussions and
negotiations between Chiles and ENSCO is summarized below.

     During a regular ENSCO board of directors meeting on January 29, 2002, the
ENSCO directors reviewed various potential business combinations including a
possible combination with Chiles. ENSCO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Carl F. Thorne, met with Chiles' Chairman, Charles Fabrikant, on March 18, 2002,
while they were both attending an industry meeting in Washington, D.C. At that
time Messrs. Thorne and Fabrikant discussed generally the mutual benefits that
could be derived from a combination of ENSCO and Chiles and, while no proposal
for an acquisition was then made, they agreed to continue the dialogue.

     On April 17, 2002, Messrs. Thorne and Fabrikant met in Dallas, Texas, to
further discuss a potential combination. During this meeting they reviewed
publicly available earnings data, discussed valuations, valuation methodologies,
the status of their respective rig fleets, Chiles' outstanding debt, and the
strategic, financial and operational advantages of a potential combination. They
preliminarily discussed the bases upon which Chiles could merge into ENSCO with
the merger consideration for Chiles stockholders consisting solely of ENSCO
shares or a combination of ENSCO shares and cash. During this meeting, Mr.
Fabrikant suggested a combination of cash and ENSCO stock having a value
approaching $30 for each share of Chiles common stock might be acceptable, and
Mr. Thorne suggested merger consideration with a value in the $26-$27 range for
each share of Chiles common stock would be more appropriate.

     On April 22, 2000, a telephone conversation was held between ENSCO and
Chiles representatives. Mr. Thorne and C. Christopher Gaut, ENSCO's Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, engaged in a discussion with Messrs.
Fabrikant and Dick Fagerstal, Chiles' Senior Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer and Secretary. During this telephone conversation the representatives of
the parties discussed the desirability of merging Chiles into ENSCO, reviewed
historical stock prices and market capitalization of the companies and further
considered various financial and structural bases upon which a combination could
be achieved for the benefit of the stockholders of both companies.

     On the morning of April 29, 2002, the same parties that participated in the
April 22 discussion, joined by Mr. Richard LeBlanc, then ENSCO's Treasurer and
Director of Investor Relations, participated in a telephone conversation during
which the parties discussed various potential common stock exchange ratios and
cash consideration which could serve as a basis for a combination of the two
companies. That afternoon, Messrs. Thorne, Gaut and LeBlanc engaged in a
telephone conversation with Messrs. Fabrikant and Fagerstal to further discuss
the potential combination. During the discussions, Mr. Fabrikant advised other
participants in the telephone conversation that he would contact ENSCO on or
before May 6, 2002, and advised that he also intended to contact another party
that had expressed interest in a combination with Chiles.

     Between April 29 and May 3, 2002, Mr. Thorne briefed ENSCO directors
concerning the status and substance of ENSCO's discussions with Chiles and
received support for continued negotiation of a potential combination.

     On May 3, 2002, Messrs. Thorne and Gaut engaged in a telephone conversation
with Messrs. Fabrikant and Fagerstal to further discuss the potential
combination of ENSCO and Chiles. They discussed, among other things, the
potential economic bases of the combination and a schedule for preparation of
the requisite documentation and presentation of the matter to their companies'
respective boards of directors. During this discussion, Mr. Thorne proposed
merger consideration of approximately $27.25 to be paid in cash and shares of
ENSCO common stock for each share of Chiles common stock.

     On May 5, 2002, Messrs. Thorne and Fabrikant had several telephone
conversations during which they discussed the principal terms to be addressed in
a definitive merger agreement and reached agreement on terms of a transaction
that they were prepared to present to their respective boards of directors
involving merger consideration for the Chiles stockholders consisting of 0.6575
share of ENSCO common stock and $5.25 in cash for each share of Chiles common
stock. They agreed to proceed promptly with due diligence and commence
negotiations directed towards reaching agreement on a definitive merger
agreement.

     On May 6, 2002, Messrs. Thorne, Gaut and LeBlanc further discussed the
potential combination with Messrs. Fabrikant and Fagerstal, including their
understandings with respect to the form and amount of merger consideration and
other issues that would be addressed in a merger agreement. On the same day, a
telephonic meeting of the Chiles board of directors was convened for the purpose
of apprising the Chiles directors of the proposal received from ENSCO, the
possibility of a merger and related matters.

     During the May 6, 2002 Chiles board of directors meeting, Mr. Fabrikant
described the proposed terms of the merger and presented his view that, based on
his discussions with other possible merger partners and after considering the
value of Chiles' assets and market prices of Chiles' and ENSCO's stock,

a merger with ENSCO on the proposed terms could be in the best interests of the
Chiles stockholders. The Chiles board also discussed past contacts and
exploratory discussions with parties other than ENSCO, none of which resulted in
a proposed transaction. Attorneys from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP ("Weil
Gotshal"), Chiles' legal counsel, discussed the board's fiduciary obligations,
the desirability of obtaining an opinion from a financial advisor prior to
authorizing execution of definitive merger documentation and the anticipated
timing of the transaction. Following discussion, the Chiles board authorized and
directed the members of Chiles' Executive Committee, Messrs. Fabrikant, Chiles
and Fagerstal, to negotiate the terms of a merger agreement subject to approval
of the Chiles board of directors, engage a financial advisor and take such other
action as they deem appropriate in furtherance of the potential transaction.

     Following the Chiles board of directors' meeting on May 6, 2002, Chiles and
ENSCO entered into a confidentiality agreement and commenced an exchange of data
to supplement the reviews that they had been conducting through examination of
publicly available materials concerning the respective companies. On May 7,
2002, a draft merger agreement was provided by Baker & McKenzie, legal counsel
to ENSCO, to Chiles and Weil Gotshal.

     Meetings were held in Houston, Texas during May 8 through May 11, 2002.
Participating were representatives of ENSCO led by Mr. Gaut, H. E. Malone, then
Vice President -- Finance, and Cary A. Moomjian, Jr., Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary, and participating representatives of Chiles led by
William E. Chiles, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fagerstal and Don
Gregg, Senior Vice President Operations & Engineering. Also participating were
attorneys from Baker & McKenzie, attorneys from Weil Gotshal, legal counsel to
Chiles, and representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, which had
been retained by Chiles as its financial advisor. The meetings were held for
purposes of engaging in mutual due diligence and negotiating and drafting the
terms of a merger agreement between ENSCO and Chiles and the voting agreements
ENSCO proposed to enter into with Chiles' principal stockholders, SEACOR,
Patricio Alvarez Morphy, Luis Alvarez Morphy and Javier Alvarez Morphy. The
negotiation of the merger and voting agreement terms continued telephonically
from May 12 through May 14, 2002.

     On May 10, 2002, a telephonic meeting of the Chiles board of directors was
convened for the purpose of informing directors of the status of negotiations of
the terms of the proposed merger with ENSCO. Mr. Fabrikant and a representative
of Weil Gotshal explained that the primary open issues under negotiation were
employee compensation arrangements, the size of the termination or "break-up"
fee payable to ENSCO under certain circumstances, including if Chiles were to
accept a superior proposal and terminate the merger agreement, and the related
"no-solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement, which would prohibit
Chiles from soliciting third party offers and could limit Chiles' ability to
furnish information to or negotiate with any third party bidders who made
unsolicited acquisition proposals for Chiles. Representatives of Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation discussed with the Chiles board the types of financial
analyses they were performing and the status of their financial due diligence.

     Following the Chiles board of directors meeting on May 10, representatives
of Chiles, ENSCO and their respective counsel continued negotiations. During the
period from May 10 through May 14, 2002, representatives of ENSCO, among other
things, agreed to a reduction in the amount of the initially proposed
termination or "break-up" fee, negotiated certain modifications to ENSCO's
proposed "no solicitation" provisions, and agreed upon the ability of all Chiles
option holders to receive completely vested options upon consummation of a
transaction and various employee "stay" bonus and severance arrangements. Chiles
also agreed upon provisions proposed by ENSCO that would allow either party to
terminate the merger agreement in the event that, prior to consummation of the
merger, any of the drilling rigs owned by Chiles is actually or constructively
lost.

     On May 14, 2002, the ENSCO board of directors conducted a meeting in
Dallas, Texas, to consider the proposed transaction. During this meeting, Mr.
Thorne and other management personnel reviewed the proposed merger transaction
with ENSCO's board. The review included the strategic reasons for the proposed
transaction, a financial review, a review of Chiles' rig fleet, business
operations and financial condition, and a report describing the results of
ENSCO's due diligence review. During the board meeting,

ENSCO's counsel from Baker & McKenzie delivered a presentation concerning the
proposed transaction, including a review of the principal terms of the merger
agreement. Following deliberation, in which it was determined that the merger
and merger agreement are advisable and in the best interest of ENSCO's
stockholders, and, on motion unanimously approved, the ENSCO board of directors
adopted resolutions approving the proposed merger and authorizing ENSCO to enter
into the merger agreement and other matters ancillary to consummation of the
transaction subject to approval by regulatory authorities and the Chiles
stockholders.

     Also on May 14, 2002, the Chiles board of directors met in New York, New
York, to consider the proposed merger transaction. Chiles management and legal
counsel made presentations concerning the terms of the merger agreement and
related documentation and the proposed transaction. In addition, Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation reviewed with the Chiles board its financial analyses
of the proposed merger consideration and rendered to the Chiles board its
opinion, described in "-- Opinion of Financial Advisor." After full discussion
and consideration, the Chiles board unanimously approved the merger agreement
and the merger and adopted resolutions authorizing and directing certain
officers of Chiles to execute and deliver the merger agreement with such changes
as may be deemed advisable by such officers. The Chiles board also resolved to
recommend that the Chiles stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement
and the related transactions. For a description of the reasons for the decision
and recommendation, see "-- Reasons for the Merger."

     After negotiation of the final terms of the merger agreement and related
documents, ENSCO and Chiles executed the agreements on the evening of May 14,
2002. At that time, each of SEACOR, Patricio Alvarez Morphy, Luis Alvarez Morphy
and Javier Alvarez Morphy also executed voting agreements with ENSCO.

     On Wednesday, May 15, 2002, before the opening of trading on the American
Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, ENSCO and Chiles issued a joint
press release announcing the proposed transaction.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Chiles determined to pursue the merger for the following reasons:

     - THE MERGER WILL POSITION CHILES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY.  As the
       offshore drilling industry continues to consolidate, local and regional
       offshore drilling companies suffer the disadvantages of smaller economies
       of scale and less diversification of risk than their larger global
       competitors. A combination of ENSCO and Chiles would make Chiles a part
       of a much larger and more globally diversified drilling rig operator able
       due to its larger asset base, for instance, to effectively compete in
       markets that are profitable, but less stable economically or politically.
       The merger also is expected to provide the combined company opportunities
       to achieve greater economies of scale, access to capital markets and
       operating efficiencies.

     - THE MERGER CONSIDERATION REPRESENTED A SUBSTANTIAL PREMIUM TO CHILES'
       HISTORICAL STOCK PRICE. In the merger, Chiles stockholders will receive
       cash and ENSCO common stock with an aggregate value of $28.50 per share
       of Chiles common stock based on the closing market price of ENSCO's
       common stock on May 14, 2002, the date the merger agreement was signed.
       This represented a premium of approximately 18.8% based upon Chiles and
       ENSCO common stock closing prices on May 14, 2002, the day before the
       execution of the merger agreement was publicly announced.

     - THE MERGER REPRESENTS THE BEST TRANSACTION THAT THE CHILES BOARD BELIEVES
       IT COULD OBTAIN. Chiles was not the subject of an "auction" or other
       sales process pursuant to which all potential buyers were given an
       opportunity to make acquisition proposals prior to the signing of the
       merger agreement. However, informal discussions concerning possible
       business combinations were conducted over the past twelve months with a
       number of Chiles' competitors and such discussions did not lead to any
       firm offer or firm indication of interest on terms more favorable than
       those offered by ENSCO. In addition, the terms of the merger agreement
       permit Chiles to enter into

       discussions or negotiations with, furnish information to, or (subject to
       the payment of a termination fee to ENSCO) enter into an acquisition
       agreement with any other potential acquiror that makes a proposal on
       terms that the Chiles board of directors determines to be more favorable
       to Chiles' stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms of
       the merger with ENSCO. Notwithstanding the public dissemination of these
       merger agreement terms through press releases and filings by Chiles and
       ENSCO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, no third party has
       approached Chiles with any such proposal.

     - THE MERGER WILL PROVIDE CHILES STOCKHOLDERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT
       FROM GREATER LIQUIDITY OF THEIR INVESTMENT THAN AN INVESTMENT OF CHILES
       COMMON STOCK.  Because the average trading volume of ENSCO common stock
       far exceeds that of Chiles common stock, the merger will provide Chiles
       stockholders the opportunity to benefit from greater liquidity of their
       investment.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, AND RECOMMENDATION OF, THE CHILES BOARD

     At a meeting of the Chiles board held on May 14, 2002, after due
consideration, the Chiles board unanimously:

     - determined that the terms of the merger agreement are advisable and fair
       to and in the best interests of Chiles and its stockholders;

     - voted to adopt resolutions that approved the merger and the merger
       agreement and related matters; and

     - determined to recommend that the Chiles stockholders adopt the merger
       agreement.

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
and to recommend that Chiles stockholders approve the merger agreement, the
Chiles board of directors consulted with Chiles' management and its financial
and legal advisors and considered certain factors, including the following:

     - the reasons described under "-- Reasons for the Merger";

     - the terms of the merger agreement, including the form of consideration
       consisting of both ENSCO shares and cash, the fixed exchange ratio for
       ENSCO shares and Chiles' ability, under certain circumstances, to
       terminate the merger agreement to accept an acquisition proposal deemed
       by the Chiles directors to be more favorable to Chiles stockholders from
       a financial point of view than the terms of the merger agreement upon
       payment of a termination fee to ENSCO;

     - information concerning the business, earnings, operations, financial
       condition and prospects of Chiles and ENSCO, both individually and on a
       combined basis, including information with respect to the past earnings
       and stock performance of each of Chiles and ENSCO;

     - the ability to complete the merger, including, in particular, the fact
       that ENSCO does not require a stockholder vote or third party financing
       to complete the merger;

     - the anticipated expiration or termination of the HSR waiting period;

     - the familiarity of the Chiles board of directors with the business,
       properties and prospects of Chiles, including the opportunities and
       alternatives available to Chiles if the merger were not to be undertaken;

     - Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's opinion, dated May 14, 2002, and
       related financial analyses reviewed with the Chiles board of directors
       and described under "-- Opinion of Financial Advisor";

     - the fact that a substantial portion of the consideration to be received
       by Chiles stockholders in the merger will be tax-free to Chiles
       stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

     - the fact that SEACOR, Patricio Alvarez Morphy, Luis Alvarez Morphy and
       Javier Alvarez Morphy agreed to vote their shares of Chiles common stock
       (which shares represented

       approximately 37.0% of the outstanding common stock of Chiles as of the
       date of the merger agreement) for the approval of the merger agreement;

     - the interests of the directors and executive officers in the merger as
       described in "-- Interests of Certain Persons; Possible Conflicts of
       Interest of Certain Persons in the Merger."

     The Chiles board of directors also was aware of certain potential risks
relating to the merger, including the following:

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including but not
       limited to:

      - the obligation of Chiles to pay a termination fee of $22.5 million to
        ENSCO under certain circumstances upon termination of the merger
        agreement;

      - the prohibition against solicitation of alternative transactions and
        certain restrictions on furnishing information to or engaging in
        negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition
        proposals;

      - the limitations upon the interim business operations of Chiles imposed
        by the merger agreement and the risks to Chiles' continuing business if
        the merger is not consummated;

     - the risks in consummating the merger;

     - the risk that the Chiles stockholders could receive a combination of cash
       and ENSCO common stock with a market value that is less than the market
       value of Chiles common stock on the date the merger agreement was signed;

     - the impact of the merger on Chiles' customers and employees and the
       potential negative impact on the ability of Chiles to retain key
       employees if the merger is not consummated;

     - the risk associated with integrating the businesses of the combined
       company and the achievement of the intended advantages of the merger; and

     - the other risks described under "Risk Factors" on page 17.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and
given weight by the Chiles board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive,
but includes the material factors considered by the Chiles board of directors.
In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger and to
recommend approval of the merger agreement to the Chiles stockholders, the
Chiles board did not assign any relative or specific weights to the various
factors considered. Instead, the Chiles board of directors conducted an overall
analysis of the factors described above, including by participating in
discussions with and asking questions of Chiles' management and its legal and
financial advisors. In considering the factors above, individual directors may
have given different weight to different factors.

     For the reasons discussed above, the Chiles board of directors unanimously
approved and deemed advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of Chiles
and its stockholders the merger agreement and the merger, and recommends that
Chiles stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation has acted as Chiles' exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Chiles
selected Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation based on Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation's experience, expertise and reputation, and its familiarity
with Chiles and its business.

     In connection with Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's engagement,
Chiles requested that Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of

Chiles common stock, other than SEACOR, Patricio Alvarez Morphy, Luis Alvarez
Morphy, Javier Alvarez Morphy and their respective affiliates, of the merger
consideration provided for in the merger. On May 14, 2002, at a meeting of the
Chiles board of directors held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation delivered to the Chiles board of directors a written opinion
dated May 14, 2002, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject
to the matters described in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of Chiles common stock, other than
SEACOR, Patricio Alvarez Morphy, Luis Alvarez Morphy, Javier Alvarez Morphy and
their respective affiliates.

     THE FULL TEXT OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION'S WRITTEN OPINION,
DATED MAY 14, 2002, TO THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX F AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BY REFERENCE. CHILES STOCKHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ
THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON
CORPORATION'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE CHILES BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES
ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, OF THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION, DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY
RELATED TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER
AS TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST
BOSTON CORPORATION'S OPINION IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN
ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation reviewed
the merger agreement and related documents, as well as publicly available
business and financial information relating to Chiles and ENSCO. Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation also reviewed other information relating to Chiles and
ENSCO, including financial forecasts, provided to or discussed with Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation by Chiles and ENSCO and met with the managements
of Chiles and ENSCO to discuss the businesses and prospects of Chiles and ENSCO.
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation considered financial and stock market
data of Chiles and ENSCO, and compared those data with similar data for publicly
held companies in businesses similar to Chiles and ENSCO, and considered, to the
extent publicly available, the financial terms of other business combinations
and other transactions announced or effected. Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation also considered other information, financial studies, analyses and
investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed
relevant.

     In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation did
not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of the
information that it reviewed or considered and relied on that information being
complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial
forecasts, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation was advised, and assumed, that
the forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the managements of Chiles and ENSCO as to
the future financial performance of Chiles and ENSCO and the strategic benefits
and potential synergies (including the amount, timing and achievability thereof)
anticipated to result from the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
also assumed, with Chiles' consent, that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without amendment,
modification or waiver of any material term, condition or agreement and that in
the course of obtaining any necessary regulatory and third party approvals and
consents relating to the merger, no modification, condition, restriction,
limitation or delay would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Chiles
or ENSCO or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation also assumed, with Chiles' consent, that the merger would be treated
as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation was not requested to, and did not, make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise)
of Chiles or ENSCO, and Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation was not furnished
with any evaluations or appraisals.

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's opinion was necessarily based on
information available to it, and financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated, on the date of Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation's opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation did
not express any opinion as to what the value of ENSCO common stock actually
would be when issued in the merger

or the prices at which ENSCO common stock would trade at any time. Although
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation evaluated the merger consideration from a
financial point of view, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation was not
requested to, and did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the
merger, which consideration was determined between Chiles and ENSCO. Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation's opinion did not address the relative merits of
the merger as compared to other business strategies that might have been
available to Chiles, and also did not address the underlying business decision
of Chiles to proceed with the merger. Except as described above, Chiles imposed
no other limitations on Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation with respect to
the investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     In preparing its opinion to the Chiles board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses, including those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation's analyses described below is not a complete description of
the analyses underlying its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and
factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion.

     In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Chiles and ENSCO. No
company, transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation's analyses as a comparison is identical to Chiles, ENSCO or the
proposed merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions analyzed. The estimates contained
in Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's analyses and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's opinion and financial analyses
were only one of many factors considered by the Chiles board of directors in its
evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of the Chiles board of directors or management with respect to the
merger or the merger consideration.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation's opinion dated May 14, 2002 delivered to
the Chiles board of directors in connection with the merger. THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN
ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL
ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.
CONSIDERING THE DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE
DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE
VIEW OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

CHILES

     Introduction.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation performed a
"Discounted Cash Flow Analysis," "Selected Companies Analysis" and "Selected
Transactions Analysis" for Chiles. Based on these analyses, Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation derived the following aggregate per share equity reference
range for Chiles, as compared to the implied merger consideration in the merger
based on the closing price of ENSCO common stock on May 13, 2002 of $35.28:

AGGREGATE IMPLIED PER SHARE  IMPLIED MERGER CONSIDERATION BASED ON ENSCO
  EQUITY REFERENCE RANGE           COMMON STOCK AS OF MAY 13, 2002
- ---------------------------  -------------------------------------------

     $20.97 to $28.27                          $28.45

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
estimated the present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash
flows that Chiles could generate for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006, based on
internal estimates of Chiles management, as adjusted in consultation with Chiles
management. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation calculated a range of
estimated terminal values for Chiles by applying a range of selected earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as
EBITDA, terminal value multiples of 8.5x to 10.5x to Chiles' calendar year 2006
estimated EBITDA. The estimated free cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value using selected discount rates ranging from 12.5% to
14.0%. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity reference
range for Chiles, as compared to the implied merger consideration in the merger
based on the closing price of ENSCO common stock on May 13, 2002 of $35.28:

  IMPLIED PER SHARE                IMPLIED MERGER CONSIDERATION

- ----------------------  --------------------------------------------------

   $20.50 to $26.06                           $28.45

     Selected Companies Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
compared financial, operating and stock market data of Chiles to corresponding
data for the following eight publicly traded companies, including Chiles, in the
offshore drilling industry:

     - Atwood Oceanics, Inc.

     - Chiles

     - Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

     - ENSCO

     - GlobalSantaFe Corporation

     - Noble Drilling Corporation

     - Rowan Companies, Inc.

     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation reviewed enterprise values,
calculated as equity value plus net debt, as multiples of estimated replacement
cost and calendar years 2002 and 2003 estimated EBITDA. Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation also reviewed market values as multiples of calendar years
2002 and 2003 estimated net income plus depreciation, commonly referred to as
after tax cash flow. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation then applied a range
of selected multiples derived from the selected companies of estimated
replacement cost, calendar years 2002 and 2003 estimated EBITDA and calendar
years 2002 and 2003 estimated after tax cash flow to corresponding financial
data of Chiles. All multiples were based on closing stock prices on May 13,
2002. Estimated financial data for Chiles were based on internal estimates of
Chiles management, as adjusted in consultation with Chiles management, except
the estimated replacement cost, which was based on Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation equity research estimates adjusted in consultation with Chiles
management, and estimated financial data for the selected companies were based
on publicly available research estimates. This analysis indicated the following

implied per share equity reference range for Chiles, as compared to the implied
merger consideration in the merger based on the closing price of ENSCO common
stock on May 13, 2002 of $35.28:

  IMPLIED PER SHARE                IMPLIED MERGER CONSIDERATION

ENSCO                                                    Penrod Holding Corporation

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation compared enterprise values in the
selected transactions as multiples of latest 12 months revenue, EBITDA and
earnings before interest and taxes, commonly referred to as EBIT. Credit Suisse
First Boston Corporation then applied a range of selected multiples derived from
the selected transactions of latest 12 months revenue, EBITDA and EBIT to
corresponding financial data of Chiles. All multiples for the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant transaction. Historical financial data for Chiles
were based on publicly available filings of Chiles. This analysis indicated the
following implied per share equity reference range for Chiles, as compared to
the implied merger consideration in the merger based on the closing price of
ENSCO common stock on May 13, 2002 of $35.28:

- ---------------------------  -------------------------------

     $32.77 to $41.58                    $35.28

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation

flows that ENSCO could generate for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006, based on
internal estimates of ENSCO management, as adjusted in consultation with ENSCO
management. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation calculated a range of
estimated terminal

values for ENSCO by applying a range of selected EBITDA terminal value multiples
of 8.5x to 10.5x to ENSCO's calendar year 2006 estimated EBITDA. The estimated
free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using

EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS.

     Relative Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
compared the implied per share equity reference ranges for Chiles and ENSCO
derived from the "Discounted Cash Flow Analysis," "Selected Companies Analysis"
and "Selected Transactions Analysis" for Chiles and ENSCO described above in
order to derive the following implied exchange ratio reference ranges, including
an aggregate implied reference range derived from these analyses, as compared to
the implied exchange ratio in the

merger of 0.8063x, assuming an all-stock transaction of 0.6575 of a share of
ENSCO common stock, plus 0.1488 of a share of ENSCO common stock in lieu of
$5.25 cash per share, based on the closing stock price of ENSCO common stock on
May 13, 2002 of $35.28:

     Contribution Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation reviewed the
relative contributions of Chiles and ENSCO to estimated replacement cost and
calendar years 2002 and 2003 estimated EBITDA and after tax cash flow. Estimated
financial data were based on the internal estimates of Chiles and ENSCO
managements, as adjusted in consultation with Chiles and ENSCO managements,
respectively, except that the estimated replacement cost was based on, in the
case of Chiles, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation equity research estimates
adjusted in consultation with Chiles management and, in the case of ENSCO,
publicly available research estimates. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
then computed implied exchange ratios, assuming an all-stock transaction, based
on the diluted ownership percentages of the Chiles stockholders in the combined
company implied by Chiles' relative contribution for each metric observed.

     This analysis indicated the following implied exchange ratio reference
range, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger, assuming an all-stock
transaction based on the assumptions described in "-- Opinion of Financial
Advisor -- Exchange Ratio Analysis -- Relative Exchange Ratio Analysis":

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
reviewed the ratio of the closing price of Chiles common stock to the closing
price of ENSCO common stock on May 13, 2002 and the average of these daily
ratios calculated over the one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month and
one-year periods ending May 13, 2002, and since Chiles' initial public offering
date of September 22, 2000. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation then computed
the premium/(discount) implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.8063x,
assuming an all-stock transaction based on the assumptions described in
"-- Opinion of Financial Advisor -- Exchange Ratio Analysis -- Relative Exchange
Ratio Analysis," relative to the implied average exchange ratios for the periods
observed, as indicated in the following table:

PRO FORMA TRANSACTION CONSEQUENCES

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation analyzed the potential pro forma
effect of the merger on ENSCO's calendar years 2002 and 2003 estimated earnings
per share, commonly referred to as EPS, and estimated after tax cash flow per
share, giving effect to potential costs savings and other synergies estimated by
the management of ENSCO to result from the merger and other merger related
adjustments. Estimated financial data were based on publicly available research
estimates. Based on the merger consideration in the merger, this analysis
suggested that the merger could be accretive to ENSCO's estimated EPS and
estimated after tax cash flow per share for each of the periods reviewed.

     The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected
results and the variations may be material.

OTHER FACTORS

     In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

     - the average cost and replacement cost per rig, as compared to the
       enterprise value of Chiles, taking into account Chiles' management's data
       and estimates of rig completion costs and Credit Suisse First Boston
       Corporation equity research estimates of replacement costs, implied by
       the merger consideration in the merger based on the closing price of
       ENSCO common stock on May 13, 2002 of $35.28;

     - the historical price performance and trading characteristics of Chiles
       common stock and ENSCO common stock and the relationship between
       movements in Chiles common stock, ENSCO common stock and the S&P Drilling
       Index; and

     - selected credit statistics of ENSCO on a stand-alone basis and pro forma
       for the merger.

MISCELLANEOUS

     The engagement letter between Chiles and Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation provides for the payment of $750,000 upon delivery of the opinion
and an additional $2,250,000 upon consummation of the merger. Chiles also has
agreed to reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel
and any other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, and to
indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and related parties against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising
out of its engagement.

     Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and its affiliates have in the past
provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking and financial
services to Chiles and ENSCO and their affiliates, including SEACOR, unrelated
to the proposed merger, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation and its affiliates have received, and expect to receive,
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities
of Chiles and ENSCO and their affiliates, including SEACOR, for their own
accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold long or short positions in those securities.

REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to review by the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, ENSCO and Chiles are
required to make pre-merger notification filings and to await the expiration or
early termination of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the
merger. On May 23 and 24, 2002, ENSCO and Chiles, respectively, filed a
Premerger Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

     There can be no assurance that the governmental reviewing authorities will
terminate the applicable statutory waiting period or clear the merger at all or
without restrictions or conditions that would have a materially adverse effect
on the combined company if the merger is completed. These restrictions and
conditions could include the grant of a complete or partial license,
divestiture, spin-off or the holding separate of assets or businesses. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, ENSCO has no obligation, if requested or required
by governmental authorities, to (a) dispose or transfer or cause Chiles or any
of its subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause
Chiles or any of its subsidiaries to dispose of any assets, (b) discontinue or
cause Chiles or any of its subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or
service, or to commit to cause Chiles or any of its subsidiaries to discontinue
offering any product or service, (c) hold separate or cause Chiles or any of its
subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after
the closing of the merger), or to commit to cause Chiles or any of its
subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations, (d) make or cause Chiles
or any of its subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any governmental entity or
otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of Chiles or
any of its subsidiaries, or (e) contest any proceeding relating to the merger if
ENSCO determines in good faith that contesting such proceeding might not be
advisable.

     In addition, during or after the statutory waiting period and clearance of
the merger, and even after completion of the merger, either the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
could challenge, seek to block or block the merger under the antitrust laws, as
it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Other competition
agencies with jurisdiction over the merger could also initiate action to
challenge or block the merger. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a competitor,
customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the
antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger, before or after it
is completed. ENSCO and Chiles cannot be sure that a challenge to the merger
will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, ENSCO and Chiles will prevail.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following general discussion summarizes the material United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger to Chiles and to United States
holders of Chiles common stock who hold their Chiles common stock as a capital
asset. It does not address all of the United States federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their
individual circumstances or to stockholders who are subject to special rules,
including, without limitation:

     - financial institutions;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

     - foreign holders;

     - persons who hold such shares as a hedge against currency risk, or as part
       of a constructive sale or conversion transaction; or

     - holders who acquired their shares upon the exercise of employee stock
       options or otherwise as compensation.

     No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service as
to the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger, and the
following summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts.
It is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws, regulations, rulings and
decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does
not address tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws.

     For purposes of this discussion, we use the term "United States holder" to
mean:

     - a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation, partnership, and, with respect to a partnership, any
       partnership treated as a domestic partnership for U.S. federal income tax
       purposes, or other entity created or organized under the laws of the
       United States or any of its political subdivisions;

     - a trust that (a) is subject to the supervision of a court within the
       United States and the control of one or more United States persons or (b)
       has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury
       regulations to be treated as a United States person; or

     - an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its
       income regardless of its source.

     CHILES STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER
TAX LAWS.

EXCHANGE OF CHILES COMMON STOCK FOR A COMBINATION OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK AND
CASH.

     The consummation of the merger is conditioned on (a) the receipt by ENSCO
of an opinion from Baker & McKenzie, counsel to ENSCO, dated the date of the
effective time of the merger, to the effect that the merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
and (b) the receipt by Chiles of an opinion from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP,
counsel to Chiles, dated the date of the effective time of the merger, to the
effect that the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinions will be based on
representations contained in representation letters provided by ENSCO and
Chiles, all of which must continue to be true and accurate in all respects as of
the effective time of the merger, and on certain customary factual assumptions.
The opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts.

     Assuming that the merger is treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code:

     - a Chiles stockholder will recognize gain equal to the lesser of (a) the
       cash received by the stockholder in the merger or (b) an amount equal to
       the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair
       market value of the ENSCO common stock received by the stockholder in the
       merger over (ii) the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the Chiles
       common stock exchanged by the stockholder in the merger; for this
       purpose, a Chiles stockholder must calculate gain or loss separately for
       each identifiable block of Chiles common stock exchanged by the
       stockholder in the merger and cannot utilize a loss realized on one block
       of Chiles common stock to offset a gain realized on another block of
       Chiles common stock;

     - except as discussed below under "-- Tax Character of Cash Consideration,"
       the gain recognized by a Chiles stockholder in the merger will be treated
       as capital gain;

     - a Chiles stockholder will not recognize any loss in the merger (except,
       possibly, in connection with cash received instead of a fractional share,
       as discussed below);

     - the aggregate tax basis of the shares of ENSCO common stock received by a
       Chiles stockholder (before reduction for the basis in any fractional
       share of ENSCO common stock for which cash is received) in exchange for
       Chiles common stock in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the stockholder's Chiles common stock, decreased by the amount
       of cash received by the stockholder in the merger (excluding any cash
       received instead of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of
       gain recognized by the stockholder in the merger (including any portion
       of the gain that is treated as a dividend but excluding any gain
       recognized as a result of cash received instead of a fractional share);

     - a Chiles stockholder's holding period with respect to the shares of ENSCO
       common stock received in the merger will include the holding period of
       the Chiles common stock exchanged for ENSCO common stock;

     - ENSCO will not recognize gain or loss in the merger; and

     - ENSCO stockholders will not recognize gain or loss in the merger.

TAX CHARACTER OF CASH CONSIDERATION

     In the case of most Chiles stockholders having no direct or indirect
control over ENSCO's corporate affairs, any gain will be treated as capital gain
for United States federal income tax purposes. However, there are circumstances
under which all or a part of any gain that a Chiles stockholder recognizes in
the merger could be treated as a distribution of a dividend instead of capital
gain to the extent of the stockholder's ratable share of the undistributed
accumulated earnings and profits of the corporation. Due to the inherently
factual nature of this determination, Chiles stockholders are encouraged to
consult their tax advisors to determine whether any cash received in exchange
for their Chiles stock in the merger will be treated as a distribution of a
dividend.

CASH RECEIVED INSTEAD OF A FRACTIONAL SHARE

     ENSCO will not issue any fractional shares of ENSCO common stock in the
merger. Instead, each holder of Chiles common stock exchanged in the merger who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of ENSCO common
stock will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fractional share. A
Chiles stockholder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of ENSCO
common stock will generally recognize capital gain or loss based on the
difference between the amount of the cash received instead of a fractional share
and the stockholder's tax basis in such fractional share.

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     A Chiles stockholder who dissents to the merger will generally recognize
capital gain or loss in an aggregate amount equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received and the stockholder's tax basis in the dissenting
shares. To the extent ENSCO is required to file information returns with respect
to amounts paid to a Chiles stockholder who dissents to the merger, ENSCO
intends to report such payments when paid to the holder. However, it is possible
that a stockholder will be required to recognize gain or loss at the effective
time of the merger, and in advance of the receipt of any cash payment, in an
amount generally equal to the trading price of Chiles common stock at the
effective time of the merger. ANY CHILES STOCKHOLDER ASSERTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS
SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE TIMING, AMOUNT AND CHARACTER OF
SUCH PAYMENT.

CAPITAL GAIN

     Any capital gain recognized by an individual holder of Chiles common stock
in connection with the transfer of his or her Chiles common stock in the merger
will be subject to a maximum United States

federal income tax rate of 20% if the individual's holding period for his or her
Chiles common stock is more than 12 months at the effective time of the merger.

BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     Noncorporate holders of Chiles common stock may be subject to backup
withholding on any cash payments received in the merger. A Chiles stockholder
will not be subject to backup withholding; however, if the holder (a) furnishes
a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not
subject to backup withholding on the substitute Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered to
such holder following the completion of the merger; (b) provides a certification
of foreign status on Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or a successor form;
or (c) is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

     Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as
a refund or credit against a holder's United States federal income tax
liability, provided the holder furnishes the required information to the
Internal Revenue Service.

     Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to
a Chiles stockholder will depend on such holder's particular tax situation.
CHILES STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
TAX LAWS AND THE EFFECT OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE TAX LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
with ENSCO treated as the acquirer. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
ENSCO are recorded at historical amounts, without restatement to fair values.
The assets and liabilities of Chiles will be revalued to estimated fair value at
the date of the merger, with the excess of the purchase price over the sum of
such fair values recorded as goodwill. The estimated fair values are preliminary
and subject to change.

     The $567.9 million purchase price is calculated using the number of ENSCO
common shares expected to be issued in the merger (determined as the number of
Chiles common shares expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the merger
multiplied by the merger ratio of 0.6575) and a $33.65 per share average trading
price of ENSCO common stock for a period of time immediately before and after
the merger was announced, plus cash consideration of $5.25 per share of Chiles
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger, estimated direct
merger fees and expenses and the estimated fair value of Chiles employee stock
options, which will be assumed by ENSCO. The $567.9 million purchase price is
based on preliminary estimates and actual amounts may differ from these
estimates.

     The calculated purchase price is for accounting purposes only and is not
indicative of the price at which shares of Chiles common stock will trade
immediately before the completion of the merger or the value of shares of ENSCO
common stock to be received by Chiles stockholders in connection with the
merger.

LISTING OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK

     ENSCO common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "ESV." Application has been made and ENSCO will use reasonable
efforts to:

     - cause the shares of ENSCO common stock to be issued in the merger to be
       approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange upon the completion
       of the merger; and

     - cause the shares of ENSCO common stock to be issued upon the exercise of
       converted Chiles stock options to be approved for listing on the New York
       Stock Exchange.

     The listing of these shares of ENSCO common stock is a condition to ENSCO's
and Chiles' obligation to complete the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF CHILES COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, Chiles common stock will be delisted from the
American Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Chiles will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES OF ENSCO COMMON STOCK RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

     The shares of ENSCO common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable,
except for shares of ENSCO common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Chiles under the Securities Act of 1933 prior to the merger.
Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Chiles prior to the merger
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control with Chiles prior to the merger, and may include officers and
directors, as well as significant Chiles stockholders prior to the merger. The
merger agreement contains a list that identifies all persons whom Chiles
believes may be deemed to be affiliates of Chiles for purposes of Rule 145.
Chiles is required, pursuant to the merger agreement, to use its reasonable
efforts to cause each person it identifies on the list as a potential affiliate
to deliver to ENSCO, at or prior to the date of the mailing of the proxy
statement to Chiles stockholders, a written agreement that the affiliate will
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of ENSCO common
stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger unless the sale, transfer
or other disposition:

     - has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933;

     - is made in conformity with Rule 145; or

     - is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in
       the opinion of counsel.

     ENSCO's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of ENSCO
common stock to be received by affiliates of Chiles in the merger.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS; POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS
IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Chiles board of directors with
respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the related
transactions, stockholders should be aware that certain members of the
management of Chiles (including the executive officers identified below who
comprise Chiles' chief executive officer and its four other most highly
compensated officers)and of its board of directors have certain interests in the
merger that are in addition to the interests of the Chiles stockholders
generally (including, without limitation, the potential receipt of bonus,
severance and/or other employment benefits and compensation for stock options).

PERFORMANCE AND STAY BONUSES; DEFERRED BONUSES

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of Chiles' executive officers
identified in the table below will, upon consummation of the merger, be eligible
to receive performance bonuses and to participate in stay bonuses (other than
Donald B. Gregg). All of the performance bonuses payable to the executive
officers (other than Donald B. Gregg, who may defer a portion of his performance
bonus as described below) will be payable at the effective time of the merger.
If any executive officer of Chiles (other than William E. Chiles) accepts
employment with ENSCO, one-half of his stay bonus will be payable at the first
anniversary of his employment with ENSCO, and the remaining one-half will be
payable at the second anniversary of his employment with ENSCO, in each case if
such executive is employed with ENSCO on such anniversary date. If an executive
officer (other than William E. Chiles) is not offered employment or is offered a
position that does not have comparable pay and benefits (irrespective of title
or location of employment) and such offer is not accepted, 15% of the stay bonus
for that executive officer shall be

payable at the effective time of the merger. If an executive officer (other than
William E. Chiles) is offered and accepts employment with ENSCO, the balance of
any unpaid stay bonus will become payable in the event such executive officer is
terminated without cause (as defined in the Severance Benefits Agreement
covering such executive officer described below) within two years of his
commencement of employment with ENSCO. An additional $350,000 of performance and
stay bonuses may be paid to certain Chiles non-executive officers. A pool also
will be created and funded with $500,000 to be allocated among the non-officer
employees of Chiles, as determined by William E. Chiles and Donald B. Gregg, for
such employees' efforts in completing the merger and to assist Chiles in
retaining critical employees. Each employee who receives an allocation under
such bonus pool shall be paid such amount on the effective date of the merger.

     In addition, under Chiles' executive bonus plan, the annual executive bonus
is fully earned and vested at the time of the award. However, sixty percent of
the annual executive bonus is paid at the time of the award while the remaining
forty percent is paid (with interest) in two equal annual installments one and
two years after the date of the award. Any outstanding deferred bonus balance is
payable upon the death, disability, or termination without cause of the
executive or upon a change in control of Chiles. Accordingly, all executive
bonuses that have been deferred will become due and payable at the effective
time of the merger unless an executive terminates his employment prior to such
time.

     The following executive officers of Chiles will be entitled to receive the
performance bonus (other than Donald B. Gregg who may defer a portion of the
performance bonus as described below) at the effective time of the merger and
may be eligible to receive the stay bonus, and the deferred portion of his bonus
that will be payable in the amounts described below:

                                                               PERFORMANCE     STAY      DEFERRED

WILLIAM E. CHILES

     William E. Chiles, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Chiles, is
currently employed pursuant to an employment agreement. Subject to certain
conditions and amendments further described below, ENSCO will continue Mr.
Chiles' current employment agreement and offer Mr. Chiles a position as a Vice
President of ENSCO after the closing of the merger. Mr. Chiles has indicated
that he intends to accept the offer. If Mr. Chiles accepts the position with
ENSCO, he will continue to receive the $280,000 annual base salary he was paid
under his employment agreement with Chiles. The base salary will be payable in
accordance with ENSCO's standard payroll practices for management employees and
Mr. Chiles will have full eligibility for all medical and other benefits and
profit sharing programs for Vice Presidents of ENSCO, including stock and option
grants as may be approved by the board of directors of ENSCO. Mr. Chiles'
performance bonus (described above) will be payable at the effective time of the
merger, and his stay bonus (described above) will vest pro rata on a monthly
basis during the first two years of his employment with ENSCO following the
effective time of the merger and be payable on an annual basis during his
employment with ENSCO. If Mr. Chiles accepts a position with ENSCO, the balance
of any unpaid stay bonus (vested and unvested) will be payable if he is
subsequently terminated

or constructively terminated by ENSCO without cause (as defined in his current
employment agreement) within two years of commencement of employment with ENSCO.
If Mr. Chiles does not accept ENSCO's offer of employment, he will not receive a
stay bonus, but he will receive his performance bonus at the effective time of
the merger, up to $810,000 in severance payments described in his existing
employment agreement with Chiles in 36 equal monthly payments commencing with
the month following the effective time of the merger, and his accrued incentive
bonus for 2002, which is being accrued at the rate of $16,667 per month (subject
to certain terms in his existing agreement that could reduce the amount of these
payments if any of such payments would constitute an excess parachute payment
and result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code).

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, the severance payments payable
under Mr. Chiles' current employment agreement will be payable in full if Mr.
Chiles' employment is terminated within one year from commencement of his
employment with ENSCO. If, however, Mr. Chiles remains employed with ENSCO for
more than one year but less than three years, he will be entitled to the pro
rata portion of his severance payments. As provided in his current employment
agreement, Mr. Chiles may terminate the non-compete provisions of his employment
agreement at any time by waiving his right to receive any further severance
payments. From and after the third anniversary of his employment with ENSCO, he
will not be entitled to any severance payments other than what might otherwise
be provided to him as an employee of ENSCO.

DONALD B. GREGG

     Subject to certain conditions described further below, ENSCO will offer
Donald B. Gregg, Senior Vice President -- Operations and Engineering of Chiles,
a position with ENSCO following the merger. If Mr. Gregg enters into employment
with ENSCO, he will receive his current salary of $170,000 and comparable
medical and similar benefits as he currently receives with Chiles and he may, at
his option, defer receipt of up to $300,000 of his performance bonus to be paid
at such future date as is determined by Mr. Gregg. In addition, if Mr. Gregg
accepts employment with ENSCO, he will be entitled to a pro rata portion of his
severance payments payable under the Severance Benefits Agreement as described
below if his employment ceases for any reason during the first year of his
employment with ENSCO, and any deferred portion of his performance bonus will be
paid to him. If Mr. Gregg does not accept employment with ENSCO, he will be paid
one year of severance under the Severance Benefits Agreement described below and
his performance bonus.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS AGREEMENTS

     Under the terms of one or more Severance Benefits Agreements, each of the
executive officers of Chiles identified below will be entitled to an amount
equal to one year of his base salary in the event that such executive officer is
terminated by Chiles without cause including, without limitation, termination
without cause in connection with a change in control of Chiles. The merger will
be a change in control under the terms of the Severance Benefits Agreements.
These severance payments are payable within thirty days after the date of
termination. The executive officers that are parties to the Severance Benefits
Agreements and their current base salary are as follows: Donald B. Gregg, Senior
Vice President -- Operations and Engineering ($170,000), George Bruce Brumley,
Vice President -- Operations ($136,500), William H. Hopkins, Vice
President -- Human Resources ($136,500), and Gabriel Padilla, Vice
President -- Engineering ($136,500). Any such executive officer who accepts
employment with ENSCO will not be entitled to any severance payment under the
Severance Benefits Agreements as a result of the merger.

STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

     Certain directors and executive officers of Chiles hold options to purchase
shares of Chiles common stock pursuant to the Chiles 2000 Stock Option Plan.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, and except as described below, each
outstanding Chiles option will vest immediately and convert automatically into
an

option obligating ENSCO to pay the merger consideration upon its exercise. See
"The Merger Agreement -- Employee Benefit Matters" on page 62. If Mr. Chiles
agrees to accept employment with ENSCO prior to the effective time of the
merger, he may agree to modify the vesting schedule of his unvested options and
restricted stock prior to the merger. Mr. Chiles has indicated his intention to
elect such modification prior to the effective time of the merger. If Mr. Chiles
is terminated or constructively terminated without cause, all of his unvested
options and restricted stock will immediately vest. If Mr. Chiles or Mr. Gregg
does not accept a position with ENSCO, he will have two years from the effective
time of the merger to exercise any and all options. If Mr. Chiles or Mr. Gregg
accepts employment with ENSCO, he will have the remaining term of his options
within which to exercise his options. If either Mr. Chiles or Mr. Gregg is
terminated by ENSCO without cause, he will have two years following such
termination within which to exercise his options, such period not to exceed the
remaining term of the applicable option period. If Mr. Chiles or Mr. Gregg is
terminated by ENSCO with cause or voluntarily terminates (other than by reason
of death or disability) his employment with ENSCO, he will have a minimum of one
year after the effective time of the merger to exercise his options and, if any
such termination occurs more than nine months after the effective time of the
merger, three months after the termination of his employment with ENSCO to
exercise his options (but in no event beyond the term of the option).

     If any of the other executive officers of Chiles is not offered employment
with ENSCO or does not accept an offer of employment with ENSCO, he will have
one year from the effective time of the merger to exercise his options. If any
such executive officer accepts employment with ENSCO, he will have the remaining
term of his options within which to exercise such options. If any such executive
officer is terminated without cause, he will have one year following such
termination within which to exercise his options, such period not to exceed the
remaining term of the option period. If any such executive officer is terminated
with cause or voluntarily terminates (other than by reason of death or
disability) his employment, he will have a minimum of one year after the
effective time of the merger to exercise his options, and if any such
termination occurs more than nine months after the effective time of the merger,
three months after the termination of his employment with ENSCO, to exercise his
options (but in no event beyond the term of the option).

     Chiles has previously granted 14,000 and 3,000 shares, respectively, of
restricted stock to William E. Chiles and George Bruce Brumley. None of these
shares were vested as of May 14, 2002. Subject to William E. Chiles' right to
elect to modify the vesting schedule of his restricted stock, the restricted
stock will vest as of the effective date of the merger.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     For six years from the effective time of the merger, ENSCO has agreed to
maintain for the benefit of the current directors and officers of Chiles all
existing rights to indemnification. These rights shall be observed by the
surviving company to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law for a period
of six years from the effective time of the merger and ENSCO has agreed to
guarantee the performance of these obligations.

     From the effective time of the merger until September 18, 2006, the
surviving company shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the current
directors and officers of Chiles with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the effective time of the merger, the existing policy of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by Chiles as of the date of the merger
agreement in the form disclosed by Chiles to ENSCO prior to the date of the
merger agreement; provided that (a) the surviving company may substitute for
such existing policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage and (b) the
surviving company shall not be required to pay annual premiums for such existing
policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate.
In the event any future annual premiums for such existing policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed $200,000 in the aggregate, the surviving company
shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the existing policy (or
any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for an
aggregate annual premium of $200,000.

SEACOR SMIT INC. AGREEMENTS

     Chiles has previously entered into a commission agreement with Bassoe
Offshore (USA), Inc. ("Bassoe") and SEACOR, and an amended and restated
management and administrative services agreement with SEACOR. Bassoe is an
affiliate of Chiles because Jonathan Fairbanks, a director of Chiles, is also an
officer of Bassoe. SEACOR is an affiliate of Chiles because it beneficially owns
approximately 24% of the issued and outstanding Chiles common stock, and because
Charles Fabrikant, the chairman of Chiles, is also chairman and chief executive
officer of SEACOR and Randall Blank, Dick Fagerstal and Tim McKeand, each an
officer of SEACOR, are directors of Chiles. In connection with the merger,
SEACOR has signed a voting agreement providing that, among other things, SEACOR
will terminate all of the agreements with Chiles to which it is a party, with
such termination to be effective at the effective time of the merger. SEACOR has
waived any provisions in the agreements requiring prior notice of termination,
and SEACOR has agreed that neither Chiles nor any of its subsidiaries will incur
any liability to SEACOR as a result of such termination. In lieu of any other
payment due to SEACOR under the above mentioned agreements, ENSCO will pay to
SEACOR $1,000,000 within 60 days after delivery to Chiles of a new drilling rig
currently under construction pursuant to the commission agreement referenced
above.

BASSOE AGREEMENTS

     In addition to the commission agreement with Bassoe and SEACOR described
above, Chiles has previously entered into another commission agreement with
Bassoe, a brokerage arrangement with Bassoe Rig Partners Ltd. ("Bassoe Rig"),
and a brokerage and commission agreement with Bassoe. Bassoe Rig is also an
affiliate of Chiles because Jonathan Fairbanks, a director of Chiles, is also an
officer of Bassoe Rig and Bassoe Rig is an affiliate of Bassoe. In connection
with the merger, Bassoe and Bassoe Rig have signed a letter agreement dated May
16, 2002 providing that, among other things, Bassoe and Bassoe Rig will
terminate all of the agreements with Chiles to which each of them is a party,
with such termination to be effective at the effective time of the merger.
Bassoe and Bassoe Rig have waived any provisions in the agreements requiring
prior notice of termination, and they have agreed that neither Chiles nor any of
its subsidiaries will incur any liability to Bassoe or Bassoe Rig as a result of
such termination. In lieu of any other payment due to Bassoe and/or Bassoe Rig
under the above mentioned agreements, ENSCO will pay Bassoe $437,500 at the
effective time of the merger. ENSCO will also pay $250,000 to Bassoe within 60
days after delivery to Chiles of a new drilling rig currently being constructed
pursuant to the commission agreement referenced above. Bassoe and Bassoe Rig
have agreed that, except as expressly set forth in the letter agreement, neither
ENSCO nor Chiles or any of its subsidiaries will have any liability to Bassoe,
Bassoe Rig or any of their respective affiliates at or following the effective
time of the merger.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CHILES

     At the close of business on           , 2002, directors and executive
officers of Chiles and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote
7,403,033 shares of Chiles common stock, collectively representing approximately
36.5% of the outstanding shares of Chiles common stock on that date.

OWNERSHIP OF ENSCO BY CHILES STOCKHOLDERS AFTER THE MERGER

     ENSCO expects to issue approximately 13.3 million shares of ENSCO common
stock in the merger. Based on the number of shares of ENSCO and Chiles common
stock outstanding on the record date, after completion of the merger, former
Chiles stockholders will own approximately 9% of the then-outstanding shares of
ENSCO common stock.

MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     ENSCO intends to undertake a comprehensive review of the business,
operations, capitalization and management of Chiles with a view to optimizing
development of its potential in conjunction with ENSCO's business.

     In this regard, ENSCO plans an orderly transition and post-merger
integration of the Chiles assets, personnel and operations with particular
emphasis upon continuity of Chiles' high standards of safety and operational
performance and resulting customer acceptance. Following completion of the
merger, ENSCO anticipates that Chiles' drilling rigs will have substantial rig
crew and support personnel continuity. Although it is anticipated that the
combination of the two companies will result in synergistic general and
administrative personnel reductions, ENSCO expects to offer employment to many
of Chiles' administrative office employees.

     The officers and directors of Chore Acquisition, Inc. immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be the initial officers of the surviving
company, none of which are currently officers or directors of Chiles. The
current executive officers of ENSCO will continue to serve as executive officers
of ENSCO after the merger. William E. Chiles, the President and Chief Executive
Officer, and a director, of Chiles has been offered the position of Vice
President of ENSCO effective at the time of the merger. Mr. Chiles has indicated
that he intends to accept the offer. Other than Mr. Chiles, no current executive
officer of Chiles will serve as an executive officer of ENSCO after the merger;
however, certain of these individuals may accept employment with ENSCO other
than as executive officers.

DIVIDENDS

     The ENSCO board of directors has historically made a determination each
quarter as to the payment of dividends. ENSCO initiated the payment of a $.025
per share quarterly cash dividend on its common stock during the third quarter
of 1997 and has continued to pay such quarterly dividends through March 31,
2002. Cash dividends totaling $.10 per share were paid in both 2001 and 2000. On
May 16, 2002, ENSCO's board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend
of $.025 per share payable on June 18, 2002 to stockholders of record on June 4,
2002. ENSCO does not currently plan to change its dividend policy after the
merger (including the amount of the per share dividend by ENSCO after the
merger). Any future declaration and payment of dividends by ENSCO will be made
at the discretion of its board of directors and will be dependent upon a variety
of factors, including ENSCO's results of operations, financial condition, cash
requirements, restrictions, if any, contained in its agreements with creditors
and other relevant factors.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger
agreement, which is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and
is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary
may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is
important to you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully in its
entirety.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Chiles will merge with and into
Chore Acquisition, Inc., a new subsidiary of ENSCO, which subsidiary will be the
surviving company and will continue to exist as a 100% owned subsidiary of
ENSCO. After the merger Chore Acquisition, Inc. will change its name to Chiles
Offshore Inc.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The closing of the merger will occur no later than the third business day
after all of the conditions to completion of the merger contained in the merger
agreement are satisfied or waived (see the section entitled "-- Conditions to
Completion of the Merger" below). The merger will become effective upon the
later of the date and time of the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or upon any later date and time as
specified in the certificate of merger.

     We are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable. We
currently expect that the merger will be completed in the third calendar quarter
of 2002. However, because completion of the merger is subject to regulatory
approvals and other conditions, we cannot predict the actual timing.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of Chiles common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.6575 shares of ENSCO common
stock and $5.25 in cash upon surrender of the certificate representing that
share of Chiles common stock in the manner provided in the merger agreement,
with cash paid for fractional shares (other than shares for which appraisal
rights are validly perfected in accordance with Delaware law). However, shares
held by Chiles stockholders who validly perfect appraisal rights will be subject
to appraisal in accordance with Delaware law. ENSCO is not obligated to complete
the merger if appraisal rights are properly demanded, and such demands are not
withdrawn as of the date the merger is completed, for more than 10% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Chiles common stock.

     In addition, any shares of Chiles common stock held by ENSCO or any direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of ENSCO immediately prior to the merger
will be automatically cancelled and extinguished, and none of ENSCO or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries will receive any securities of ENSCO or
other consideration in exchange for those shares. Likewise, any shares of Chiles
common stock held by Chiles or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Chiles immediately prior to the merger will be automatically cancelled and
extinguished, and none of Chiles or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
will receive any securities of ENSCO or cash or other consideration in exchange
for those shares.

     ENSCO will not issue any fractional shares of ENSCO common stock in the
merger. Instead, each holder of Chiles common stock exchanged in the merger who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of ENSCO common
stock will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fractional share.

     The exchange ratio in the merger of 0.6575 of a share of ENSCO common stock
for each share of Chiles common stock and the cash consideration will be
adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to ENSCO common stock or Chiles common stock,
respectively, having a record date on or after the date of the merger agreement
and prior to completion of the merger.

EXCHANGE OF CHILES STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR ENSCO STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Promptly following completion of the merger, American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, the exchange agent for the merger, will mail to each record
holder of Chiles common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering the record holder's stock certificates in exchange for cash and a
certificate representing ENSCO common stock. Only those holders of Chiles common
stock who properly surrender their Chiles stock certificates in accordance with
the exchange agent's instructions will receive (a) a certificate representing
ENSCO common stock, (b) the cash consideration, (c) cash in lieu of any
fractional share of ENSCO common stock, and (d) dividends or other
distributions, if any, on ENSCO common stock to which they are entitled under
the terms of the merger agreement. After the effective time of the merger, each
certificate representing shares of Chiles common stock that has not been
surrendered will represent only the right to receive upon surrender of that
certificate each of the items listed in the preceding sentence in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement. Following completion of the merger,
Chiles will not register any transfers of Chiles common stock outstanding on its
stock transfer books prior to the merger. No merger consideration will be paid
in exchange for any shares of Chiles common stock owned by any person who is
deemed to be an "affiliate" of Chiles under the Securities Act of 1933 until
such person has executed an "affiliate agreement" pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement.

     Holders of Chiles common stock should not send in their Chiles stock
certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent,
with instructions for the surrender of Chiles stock certificates.

STOCK OPTIONS

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase Chiles
common stock issued by Chiles will be converted into an option exercisable for
the merger consideration, as described further in the section entitled
"-- Employee Benefit Matters -- Chiles Stock Options."

DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES

     Holders of Chiles common stock are not entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions on ENSCO common stock until the merger is completed. After
the merger is completed, holders of Chiles common stock certificates will be
entitled to dividends and other distributions declared or made after completion
of the merger with respect to the number of whole shares of ENSCO common stock
which they are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Chiles stock
certificates, but they will not be paid any dividends or other distributions on
the ENSCO common stock until they surrender their Chiles stock certificates to
the exchange agent in accordance with the exchange agent instructions.

LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES

     If a Chiles stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of
such certificate may need to execute an affidavit and post a bond prior to
receiving each of the items listed above under "-- Exchange of Chiles Stock
Certificates for ENSCO Stock Certificates."

       issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or any other governmental
       entity, and there has not been any law enacted, adopted or deemed
       applicable to the merger that makes consummation of the merger illegal;

     - the representations and warranties of the other party, disregarding any
       qualifications and exceptions relating to materiality or material adverse
       effect, being true and correct on the date the merger is completed as if
       they were made on that date (except to the extent that the
       representations and warranties speak as of another date), except where
       the breaches of such representations and warranties do not have, and are
       not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
       material adverse effect on the representing party;

     - the other party has performed or complied with all of its covenants and
       agreements in the merger agreement in all material respects on or prior
       to the date the merger is completed;

     - the receipt by each party of an opinion from the other party's counsel
       that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
       Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     A "material adverse effect," when used in reference to Chiles, means an
event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or other matter (considered together
with all other matters that would constitute exceptions to the representations
and warranties set forth in the merger agreement but for the presence of
material adverse effect or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications, in such representations and warranties) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the business,
condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities, operations or financial
performance of Chiles and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (b) the ability of
Chiles to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement, or
(c) ENSCO's ability to vote, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise
exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of the surviving company;
provided, however, that the following shall not be deemed to constitute, create
or cause a material adverse effect:

     - any changes, circumstances or effects that affect generally the drilling
       services industry, and do not disproportionately affect such persons, and
       that result from national, regional, state or local economic conditions,

       conducts business, from acts of war or terrorism, from changes in laws,
       rules or regulations applicable to such party or its subsidiaries or from
       other general economic conditions, facts or circumstances that are not
       subject to the control of such party; or

     - any changes, circumstances or effects that result from the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement and public announcement thereof.

     A Chiles material adverse effect will also be deemed to have occurred in
the event that prior to the effective time of the merger any of Chiles' drilling
rigs are lost (including, without limitation, as a result of any condemnation,
confiscation, requisition or other taking of title, seizure or forfeiture),
totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that the cost of repairs and/or
reconstruction constitutes a constructive, arranged or total loss regardless of
the amount of any insurance coverage.

     A "material adverse effect," when used in reference to ENSCO, means an
event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or other matter (considered together
with all other matters that would constitute exceptions to the representations
and warranties set forth in the merger agreement but for the presence of
material adverse effect or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications, in such representations and warranties) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the business,
condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities, operations or financial
performance of ENSCO and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, provided that a
decline in ENSCO's stock price will not, in and of itself, be deemed to
constitute a material adverse effect, or (b) the ability of ENSCO to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform any of its
obligations under the merger agreement.

     There are no other conditions to Chiles' obligation to complete the merger
other than as set forth in this section.

       force and effect except where the failure to do so would not be
       reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect;

     - ENSCO has received all "affiliate agreements" from each holder of Chiles
       common stock listed in the merger agreement as an "affiliate" of Chiles

CHILES SPECIAL MEETING

     Chiles has agreed to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders
of its common stock, as promptly as practicable after the registration statement
of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared effective by
the SEC, to vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The
Chiles board of directors unanimously agreed to recommend the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement to its stockholders.

     At any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by
the Chiles stockholders, the Chiles board of directors may, in a manner adverse
to ENSCO, withdraw or modify its recommendation to the Chiles stockholders if:

     - a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Chiles is made to
       Chiles and is not withdrawn;

     - Chiles provides ENSCO with at least three business days prior notice of
       any meeting of the Chiles board of directors at which the board will
       consider and determine whether the offer is a superior proposal;

     - the Chiles board of directors determines in good faith that the offer
       constitutes a superior proposal;

     - the Chiles board of directors determines in good faith, after taking into
       account the advice of outside legal counsel, that in light of the
       superior proposal the withdrawal or modification of the recommendation to
       approve and adopt the merger agreement is required in order to comply
       with its fiduciary obligations to the Chiles stockholders under
       applicable law; and

     - none of Chiles and its subsidiaries nor any of their representatives has
       violated no-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement.

     Regardless of whether Chiles has received a superior proposal or an
acquisition proposal or changed its recommendation, Chiles is obligated under
the terms of the merger agreement to call, give notice of, and hold a meeting of
its stockholders to consider and vote upon the merger agreement.

CHILES IS PROHIBITED FROM SOLICITING OTHER OFFERS

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to specific exceptions
described below, Chiles has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries
will, and that it will not authorize or permit its and their representatives to,
directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
       or announcement of, any acquisition proposal or take any action that
       could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

     - furnish any information regarding Chiles or any of its subsidiaries in
       connection with or in response to an acquisition proposal;

     - engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
       acquisition proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement,
       commitment or understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       acquisition proposal.

     Under the merger agreement, Chiles agreed to cease all existing discussions
as of the date of the merger agreement with any person with respect to any
acquisition proposal.

     Chiles is obligated to notify ENSCO promptly, orally and in writing, upon
receipt of any acquisition proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest
that is reasonably likely to lead to an acquisition proposal that is made or
submitted by any person prior to completion of the merger. The notice must
include the terms of the acquisition proposal, inquiry or indication of interest
and the identity of the person or group making the acquisition proposal. Chiles
must keep ENSCO informed with respect to the status of any acquisition proposal,
inquiry or indication of interest.

     Under the merger agreement, Chiles agreed not to release or permit the
release of any person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision
of, any confidentiality or similar agreement to which Chiles or any of its
subsidiaries is a party, and to use its reasonable efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such agreement at ENSCO's request.

     Notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in the merger agreement, if
Chiles receives a superior proposal, prior to the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement by the Chiles stockholders, Chiles

may furnish information regarding Chiles or any of its subsidiaries to, or enter
into discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to such proposal
if the following conditions are satisfied, among others:

     - neither Chiles, its subsidiaries nor any of their representatives has
       violated the provisions regarding non-solicitation in the merger
       agreement;

     - the Chiles board of directors concludes in good faith, after taking into
       account the advice of outside legal counsel, that such action is required
       to comply with the fiduciary obligations of the board to the Chiles
       stockholders under applicable law;

     - within two business days after the furnishing of information to, or
       entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, ENSCO is
       given written notice of the identity of the person making the acquisition
       proposal and the fact that Chiles furnished information to, or entered
       into discussions or negotiations with, such person; and

     - Chiles receives from the person making the acquisition proposal a
       confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
       disclosure of all information furnished to the person on behalf of
       Chiles.

     An "acquisition proposal" means any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication
of interest made by a person other than ENSCO contemplating or otherwise
relating to any "acquisition transaction."

     An "acquisition transaction" means any transaction or series of
transactions involving:

     - any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance
       of securities, acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer or
       other similar transaction (a) in which Chiles or any of its subsidiaries
       is a constituent corporation, (b) in which a person or "group" (as
       defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of persons directly or
       indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities
       representing more than 15% of the outstanding securities of any class of
       voting securities of Chiles or any of its subsidiaries, or (c) in which
       Chiles or any of its subsidiaries issues or sells securities representing
       more than 20% of the outstanding securities of any class of voting
       securities of Chiles or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - any sale (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of
       business), lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
       exchange, transfer (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course
       of business), license (other than nonexclusive licenses in the ordinary
       course of business), acquisition or disposition of any business or
       businesses or assets that constitute or account for 20% or more of the
       consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Chiles and of its
       subsidiaries.

     A "superior proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by
a third party to purchase all of the outstanding Chiles common stock on terms
that the Chiles board of directors determines, in its reasonable judgment, (a)
after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
the Chiles stockholders than the terms of the merger and (b) is reasonably
capable of being consummated; provided that any such offer shall not be deemed
to be a "superior proposal" if any financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not reasonably
capable of being obtained by such third party.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

CHILES STOCK OPTIONS

     Subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as of the effective time of the merger each option to purchase Chiles
common stock pursuant to the Chiles stock option plan that is then outstanding
will be assumed by ENSCO and converted into an option exercisable for the merger
consideration that would have been received in respect of Chiles common stock
subject to the Chiles stock option plan had such Chiles stock option been
exercised in full immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, such
that, immediately after the effective time of the merger, (a) a Chiles stock
option for one share of Chiles common stock shall be converted into a stock
option exercisable for the merger consideration at the exercise price in effect
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (b) any restriction on
the exercise of any such Chiles stock option and other provisions of such Chiles
stock option in effect at the effective time of the merger (after taking into
account any vesting that may result from the approval or consummation of the
merger) shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided that each Chiles stock option
assumed by ENSCO shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.

     ENSCO has agreed to take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Chiles stock option plan including the reservation, issuance
and use of reasonable efforts to provide for the listing of ENSCO common stock
as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. ENSCO shall use its reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form with respect
to shares of ENSCO common stock subject to the assumed Chiles stock options and
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements covering such assumed Chiles stock options (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Chiles stock options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if
any, who subsequent to the effective time will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where
applicable, ENSCO shall use all reasonable efforts to administer the Chiles
stock option plan in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the extent the Chiles stock option plan
complied with such rule prior to the merger.

CHILES EMPLOYEES

     ENSCO has agreed to provide to former employees of Chiles and its
subsidiaries under the plans continued or to be established by ENSCO
continuation group health coverage under Code Section 4980B of the Internal
Revenue Code and ERISA Section 601 et seq. for any individuals receiving such
coverage under the Chiles Offshore Health Care Benefits Plan as of the effective
time of the merger and for any employees of Chiles and its subsidiaries and
their dependents who become eligible for and elect such coverage as a result of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that ENSCO is
not obligated to extend this coverage beyond its normal expiration period.

     ENSCO and the surviving company shall cause all of their respective
employee benefit and compensation plans (including, without limitation, pension,
profit-sharing, retirement, savings, 401(k), vacation, paid time-off, employee,
and other employee financial, welfare or other benefit plans) covering or
otherwise benefiting any of the employees of Chiles who are employed by the
surviving company on or after the effective time of the merger to count any
actual service performed for Chiles or any of its subsidiaries as recognized by
Chiles or any of its subsidiaries under the terms of the Chiles benefit plans,
without duplication of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and benefit accrual to the same extent such service was recognized under
the Chiles benefit plans. If ENSCO determines to terminate or merge the 401(k)
plan or any group insurance plan into its plans, the former Chiles employees who
are then employed by the surviving company shall be eligible to participate
immediately in the similar plans sponsored and maintained by ENSCO for its
employees and ENSCO and the surviving company shall also cause all waiting
periods under each such plan of ENSCO to be waived, to the extent necessary,
with respect to such employees.

     ENSCO and the surviving company have agreed to give former Chiles employees
who are employed by the surviving company credit, for purposes of ENSCO's and
the surviving company's vacation and/or other paid leave benefit programs, for
such employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the
effective time of the merger.

     Nothing contained in the merger agreement confers upon any former Chiles
employee who is employed by the surviving company any right to continued
employment after the effective time of the merger or prevent ENSCO or the
surviving company from reserving or exercising the right to amend, modify,
change or terminate or otherwise alter any of the provisions of, or benefits
provided under, any of the Chiles benefit plans that are assumed by ENSCO or the
surviving company.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     For six years from the effective time of the merger, ENSCO has agreed to
maintain for the benefit of the current directors and officers of Chiles all
rights to indemnification. These rights shall be observed by the surviving
company to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law for a period of six
years from the effective time of the merger and ENSCO agrees to guarantee the
performance of these obligations.

     From the effective time of the merger until September 18, 2006, the
surviving company shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the current
directors and officers of Chiles with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the effective time of the merger, the existing policy of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by Chiles as of the date of the merger
agreement in the form disclosed by Chiles to ENSCO prior to the date of the
merger agreement; provided that (a) the surviving company may substitute for
such existing policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage and (b) the
surviving company shall not be required to pay annual premiums for such existing
policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate.
In the event any future annual premiums for such existing policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed $200,000 in the aggregate, the surviving company
shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the existing policy (or
any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for
aggregate annual premiums not exceeding $200,000.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

TERMINATION BY ENSCO OR CHILES

     Either Chiles or ENSCO, by action of their respective boards of directors,
may terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to
effective time of the merger:

     - by mutual written consent of ENSCO and Chiles;

     - if the merger is not completed by December 15, 2002 (unless the failure
       to consummate the merger is attributable to a failure on the part of the
       party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform any material
       obligation required to be performed by such party at or prior to the
       effective time of the merger);

     - if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body issues a
       final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling, or has taken any other
       action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
       otherwise prohibiting the merger; or

     - if the Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement
       at a duly convened stockholders meeting at which the vote to approve and
       adopt the merger agreement was taken (provided that Chiles may not
       terminate the merger agreement for this reason unless it has paid
       applicable termination fees to ENSCO).

TERMINATION BY ENSCO

     ENSCO, by action of the ENSCO board of directors, may also terminate the
merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to completion of the
merger:

     - at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by
       the Chiles stockholders, if a Chiles triggering event has occurred;

     - if any of Chiles' representations and warranties has been inaccurate as
       of the date of the merger agreement, unless such breaches do not have,
       and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
       a material adverse effect;

     - if (a) any of Chiles' representations and warranties become inaccurate as
       of a date subsequent to the date of the merger agreement (as if made on
       such subsequent date), unless such breaches do not have, and are not
       reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
       adverse effect and (b) such inaccuracy has not been cured by Chiles
       within 10 business days after its receipt of written notice thereof and
       remains uncured at the time notice of termination is given;

     - any of Chiles' covenants contained in the merger agreement have been
       materially breached; or

     - if, since the date of the merger agreement, there has occurred any event
       or occurrence, or series of events or occurrences, that has had or is
       reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate with all
       other events or occurrences since the date of the merger agreement, a
       material adverse effect.

     A "Chiles triggering event" means (a) the failure of the Chiles board of
directors to recommend that the Chiles stockholders approve and adopt the merger
agreement, or the withdrawal or modification of the Chiles board of directors'
approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or its
recommendation that stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement in a
manner adverse to ENSCO, (b) approval, endorsement or recommendation by the
Chiles board of directors of any acquisition proposal, or (c) commencement of a
tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Chiles and the failure of
Chiles to send to its stockholders, within 10 business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement disclosing that the
Chiles board of directors recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

TERMINATION BY CHILES

     Chiles, by action of the Chiles board of directors, may also terminate the
merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to completion of the
merger:

     - if prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the
       holders of Chiles common stock:

      - the Chiles board of directors has received a superior proposal;

      - in light of such superior proposal the Chiles board of directors has
        determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
        advisors, that termination is required in order for the Chiles board of
        directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Chiles'
        stockholders under applicable law;

      - Chiles has complied in all material respects the provisions regarding no
        solicitation in the merger agreement;

      - Chiles contemporaneously pays the applicable termination fee; and

      - the Chiles board of directors concurrently approves, and Chiles
        concurrently enters into, a binding definitive written agreement
        providing for the implementation of such superior proposal;

      provided that Chiles may not effect such termination unless and until (i)
      ENSCO receives at least three business days' prior written notice from
      Chiles of its intention to effect such termination; and (ii) during such
      three business day period, Chiles shall, and shall cause its respective
      financial and legal advisors to, consider any adjustment in the terms and
      conditions of the merger agreement that ENSCO may propose;

     - if any of ENSCO's representations and warranties has been inaccurate as
       of the date of the merger agreement, unless such breaches do not have,
       and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
       a material adverse effect;

     - if (a) any of ENSCO's representations and warranties become inaccurate as
       of a date subsequent to the date of the merger agreement (as if made on
       such subsequent date), unless such breaches do not have, and are not
       reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
       adverse effect and (b) such inaccuracy has not been cured by ENSCO within
       10 business days after its receipt of written notice thereof and remains
       uncured at the time notice of termination is given;

     - any of ENSCO's covenants contained in the merger agreement have been
       materially breached; or

     - if, since the date of the merger agreement, there has occurred any event
       or occurrence, or series of events or occurrences, that has had or is
       reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate with all
       other events or occurrences since the date of the merger agreement, a
       material adverse effect on ENSCO or if to the extent that prior to the
       effective time of the merger agreement any of Chiles' drilling rigs are
       lost (including, without limitation, as a result of any condemnation,
       confiscation, requisition or other taking of title, seizure or
       forfeiture), totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that the cost
       of repairs and/or reconstruction constitutes a constructive, arranged or
       total loss regardless of the amount of any insurance coverage.

TERMINATION FEE

     Chiles shall pay to ENSCO, in cash at the time specified below (and less
the amounts paid for expenses as discussed below), a nonrefundable fee in an
amount equal to $22.5 million in the following events:

     - if the merger agreement is terminated by ENSCO or Chiles because the
       Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger and at the time
       of the Chiles special meeting an acquisition proposal has been disclosed,
       announced, commenced, submitted or made and such acquisition proposal is

       consummated within 12 months of such termination of the merger agreement,
       in which case the fee shall be paid by Chiles on the date of consummation
       of the acquisition transaction provided such consummation occurs within
       12 months from the date of termination;

     - if the merger agreement is terminated by ENSCO because of the occurrence
       of a Chiles triggering event, in which case the fee shall be paid by
       Chiles within two business days after such termination; or

     - if the merger agreement is terminated by Chiles because of its approval
       and adoption of a superior proposal after the Chiles board of directors
       determined in good faith after consulting with outside legal counsel that
       termination was required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties and
       after it complied in all material respects with the no-solicitation
       provisions of the merger agreement, in which case the fee shall be paid
       by Chiles contemporaneously with such termination.

     If Chiles fails to pay when due any termination fee payable under the
merger agreement, then Chiles shall reimburse ENSCO for all costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount and the enforcement by ENSCO of its rights under the merger
agreement.

EXPENSES

     Except as set forth below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the
merger is consummated; provided that:

     - ENSCO and Chiles shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than
       attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the filing, printing and
       mailing of the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
       statement/prospectus forms a part and solicitation of proxies in
       connection with Chiles' special meeting, including fees and expenses
       incurred in connection with the engagement of proxy solicitors; and

     - if the merger agreement is terminated by ENSCO or Chiles because the
       Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement
       (without limiting any obligation of Chiles to pay any termination fee),
       Chiles shall make a nonrefundable cash payment to ENSCO, at the time
       specified below, in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all fees
       and expenses (including all attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and filing
       fees) that have been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of
       ENSCO in connection with the preparation and negotiation of the merger
       agreement and otherwise in connection with the merger or any other
       transaction contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, in no event
       will the amount of such payment for fees and expenses exceed $1,000,000.

     In the case of termination of the merger agreement by Chiles because the
Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement, any
nonrefundable payment for expenses shall be paid by Chiles contemporaneously
with such termination. In the case of termination of the merger agreement by
ENSCO because the Chiles stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger
agreement, any nonrefundable payment for expenses shall be paid by Chiles within
two business days after such termination.

AMENDMENTS, EXTENSIONS AND WAIVERS

AMENDMENTS

     The merger agreement may be amended by action of the ENSCO board of
directors, the Chore Acquisition, Inc. board of directors and the Chiles board
of directors at any time prior to the effective time of the merger. However,
after approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the Chiles stockholders,
no amendment which, by law, requires approval by the Chiles stockholders may be
made without further stockholder approval. All amendments to the merger
agreement must be in writing and signed by each party.

EXTENSIONS AND WAIVERS

     To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right
arising out of the merger agreement or any of the documents referred to in the
merger agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in a written document signed
by the other party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given and (c) no
notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation
of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in the merger agreement or
the documents referred to in the merger agreement.

                               VOTING AGREEMENTS

     The following summary describes certain material provisions of the voting
agreements, which are included in this proxy statement/prospectus as Annexes B,
C, D and E and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
This summary may not contain all of the information about the voting agreements
that is important to you. We encourage you to read the voting agreements
carefully in their entirety.

GENERAL

     Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, ENSCO
entered into separate voting agreements with each of Luis Alvarez Morphy, Javier
Alvarez Morphy, Patricio Alvarez Morphy (collectively, the "Morphy
Stockholders") and SEACOR. As of the record date for the Chiles special meeting,
these persons beneficially owned, in aggregate, 7,511,071 shares of Chiles
common stock, representing approximately 37.0% of the outstanding shares of
Chiles common stock on that date. The four voting agreements are in
substantially the same terms, except for the provisions regarding related party
agreements, as discussed below.

     Under the voting agreements, the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR have agreed
to vote all shares of Chiles common stock owned by them:

     - in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the related
       transactions; and

     - against any action, agreement, transaction or acquisition proposal that
       would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
       any other obligation or agreement of Chiles contained in the merger
       agreement or (or of any of the Morphy Stockholders or SEACOR contained in
       the voting agreements) that might hinder, delay, impede or frustrate the
       merger or the related transactions.

     The Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR have also agreed not to enter into any
contract or understanding in any manner inconsistent with the foregoing.

IRREVOCABLE PROXY

     In the voting agreements, the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR have also
granted Carl F. Thorne and C. Christopher Gaut, as representatives of ENSCO, an
irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Chiles common stock on the matters set
forth above in such manner as ENSCO shall, in its absolute discretion, deem
proper.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The voting agreements contain customary representations, warranties and
covenants given by the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR and by ENSCO relating to,
among other things, ownership of the shares of common stock that are the subject
of the agreements and authority to contract.

NO SOLICITATION

     Each of the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR has also agreed that it will
not:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
       or announcement of any acquisition proposal or take any action that could
       reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

     - furnish any information regarding Chiles or any of its subsidiaries to
       any person in connection with or in response to an acquisition proposal
       or an inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected
       to lead to an acquisition proposal;

     - engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
       acquisition proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
       contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction
       involving Chiles.

     Each of the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR has also agreed that it will:

     - immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation
       and related discussion or negotiation with respect to any acquisition
       proposal; and

     - not enter into any contract that provides for or could reasonably be
       expected to materially facilitate an acquisition proposal.

     The voting agreements do not limit or restrict any of the Morphy
Stockholders or SEACOR or any of its representatives (a) who is a member of the
board of directors of Chiles from exercising his fiduciary duties to Chiles by
voting or taking any other action whatsoever in his capacity as a director or
(b) who is an officer or employee of Chiles from taking any action whatsoever in
such capacity.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

     The voting agreements prohibit the Morphy Stockholders and SEACOR from
subjecting any of their shares of Chiles common stock to any encumbrances other
than pursuant to the voting agreements or from selling, transferring, conveying
or otherwise disposing of any interest in or title to any of such shares
(including any such action by operation of law), other than a disposition by
operation of law pursuant to the merger.

RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS

     The respective voting agreements entered into by each of the Morphy
Stockholders each include, among other things, a representation that neither he
nor any of his affiliates is a party to any contract or understanding with
Chiles or any of its subsidiaries other than the agreement with respect to
ownership of Tonala, dated July 20, 2000, among Chiles, each of those three
Stockholders, certain of Chiles' affiliates, and the other parties named in such
agreement. In their respective voting agreements, each of the Morphy
Stockholders has consented to the assignment of the Tonala agreement by Chiles
to ENSCO as a result of the merger pursuant to the terms of the Tonala
agreement.

     In its voting agreement, SEACOR represents that neither it nor any of its
affiliates is a party to any contract or understanding with Chiles or any of its
subsidiaries other than (a) a commission agreement, dated April 1, 2000, among
Bassoe, SEACOR and Chiles, and (b) an amended and restated management and
administrative services agreement, dated July 18, 2000, by and between SEACOR
and Chiles. SEACOR and Chiles have agreed that both the commission agreement and
the amended and restated management and administrative services agreement will
terminate in their entirety at the effective time of the merger, and neither
Chiles nor any of its subsidiaries will incur any further liability or
obligation to SEACOR under such agreements after the completion of the merger.
ENSCO has further agreed to pay SEACOR an amount equal to $1,000,000 within 60
days after delivery to Chiles of the new drilling rig currently being
constructed pursuant to the Commission Agreement. (See "The Merger -- Interests
of Certain Persons; Possible Conflicts of Interest of Certain Persons in the
Merger" on page 46.)

TERMINATION OF THE VOTING AGREEMENTS

     Each of the voting agreements terminates upon the earliest to occur of:

     - the completion of the merger;

     - the termination of the merger agreement for any reason; and

     - written notice by ENSCO to applicable Morphy Stockholder or SEACOR of
       termination of its respective voting agreement.

          UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SOURCES OF INFORMATION

     ENSCO and Chiles are providing the following unaudited condensed pro forma
combined financial statements to help you in your analysis of the financial
aspects of the merger of the two companies. The unaudited condensed pro forma
combined financial statements are based upon the historical financial
information of ENSCO and Chiles and should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of ENSCO and
Chiles incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 89.

HOW WE PREPARED THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet has been
prepared as if the merger had occurred on March 31, 2002. The unaudited
condensed pro forma combined statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002 have been prepared
as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2001.

     If ENSCO and Chiles had merged on the dates assumed in the pro forma
financial statements, the combined operations of ENSCO and Chiles might have
performed differently. You should not rely on the pro forma financial
information as an indication of the financial position or results of operations
that ENSCO and Chiles would have achieved together had the merger taken place at
an earlier date or of the future results that the combined operations of ENSCO
and Chiles will achieve after the merger.

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
with ENSCO treated as the acquirer. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
ENSCO are recorded at historical amounts, without restatement to fair values.
The assets and liabilities of Chiles will be revalued to estimated fair value at
the date of the merger, with the excess of the purchase price over the sum of
such fair values recorded as goodwill. The estimated fair values are preliminary
and subject to change.

     The $567.9 million purchase price is calculated using the number of ENSCO
common shares expected to be issued in the merger (determined as the number of
Chiles common shares expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the merger
multiplied by the merger ratio of 0.6575) and a $33.65 per share average trading
price of ENSCO common stock for a period of time immediately before and after
the merger was announced, plus cash consideration of $5.25 per share of Chiles
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger, estimated direct
merger fees and expenses and the estimated fair value of Chiles employee stock
options.

     The $567.9 million purchase price has been allocated based upon preliminary
estimates of the fair value of Chiles assets and liabilities and is subject to
change. The final purchase price allocation may differ from these estimates.

TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES

     ENSCO estimates that it will incur fees and expenses totaling approximately
$400,000 in connection with the merger. Chiles estimates that it will incur fees
and expenses totaling approximately $4 million in connection with the merger.
All of such costs have been reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma
combined balance sheet. After the merger, ENSCO will incur certain additional
charges and expenses relating to restructuring and integrating the operations of
ENSCO and Chiles. The pro forma financial information has not been adjusted for
these additional charges and expenses or for the estimated general and
administrative or other cost savings that may be realized as a result of the
merger.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     (1) A summary of the unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet
adjustments to effect the merger is as follows:

          (a) Cash and cash equivalents -- Represents the adjustment needed to
     recognize the cash portion of the purchase price due to the stockholders of
     Chiles at the date of merger.

          (b) Property and equipment -- Represents the adjustment needed to
     record Chiles property and equipment at estimated fair value at the date of
     the merger.

          (c) Goodwill -- The merger will be accounted for as a purchase
     business combination in accordance with accounting principles generally
     accepted in the United States, with ENSCO treated as the acquirer.
     Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ENSCO are recorded at historical
     amounts, without restatement to fair values. The assets and liabilities of
     Chiles will be revalued to estimated fair value at the date of the merger,
     with the excess of the purchase price over the sum of such fair values
     recorded as goodwill. The $567.9 million purchase price is calculated using
     the number of ENSCO common shares expected to be issued in the merger
     (determined as the number of Chiles common shares expected to be
     outstanding immediately prior to the merger multiplied by the merger ratio
     of 0.6575) and a $33.65 per share average trading price of ENSCO common
     stock for a period of time immediately before and after the merger was
     announced, plus cash consideration of $5.25 per share of Chiles common
     stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger, estimated direct merger
     fees and expenses and the estimated fair value of Chiles employee stock
     options. The recording of goodwill is supported by the nature of the
     offshore drilling industry, the acquisition of long-lived drilling
     equipment, and the assembled workforce of Chiles.

          (d) Other assets and other liabilities -- Represents the
     reclassification of Chiles deferred mobilization costs to conform with
     ENSCO's accounting policy.

          (e) Current liabilities -- A reconciliation of the pro forma
     adjustments to current liabilities is as follows (in millions):

Fees and expenses payable associated with the merger........  $ 4.4
Costs directly related to the issuance of ENSCO common stock
  at date of merger.........................................    0.5
Other merger costs, primarily Chiles employee severance
  benefits and amounts due related to terminated
  agreements................................................    6.4

                                                              =====

          (f) Deferred income taxes -- Represents the adjustment to deferred tax
     liabilities, calculated at a statutory rate of 35%, for the net effect of
     the pro forma adjustments.

          (g) Stockholders' equity -- Represents the difference between the
     non-cash portion of the purchase price and the book value of the net assets
     of Chiles at the pro forma balance sheet date, less $500,000 of estimated
     costs related to the issuance of ENSCO common shares.

                                     ENSCO

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA
                  COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

          The purchase price will be allocated based on the estimated fair
     values of Chiles assets and liabilities at the date of the merger. For
     purposes of the unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial
     statements, the purchase price has been allocated as follows (in millions):

Historical net book value of Chiles.........................  $329.8
Fair value adjustment of property and equipment.............    20.8
Fees and expenses payable associated with the merger........    (4.0)
Other merger costs, primarily Chiles employee severance
  benefits and amounts due related to terminated
  agreements................................................    (6.4)
Deferred income tax effect of pro forma adjustments.........    (4.4)
Goodwill....................................................   232.1

Total purchase price........................................  $567.9
                                                              ======

          The $567.9 million purchase price has been allocated based upon
     preliminary estimates of the fair value of Chiles assets and liabilities
     and is subject to change. The final purchase price allocation may differ
     from these estimates.

                       DESCRIPTION OF ENSCO CAPITAL STOCK

     The following is a summary of the material terms of ENSCO's capital stock.
Because the following is only a summary, it does not contain all the information
that may be important to you. Accordingly, you should read carefully the more
detailed provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of
ENSCO, the bylaws of ENSCO, as amended, and the Rights Agreement dated February
21, 1995 between ENSCO and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as amended
on March 3, 1997, each of which has been filed with the SEC, as well as the DGCL
and the section entitled "Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate
Governance Matters" on page 78.

GENERAL

     As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, ENSCO's authorized
capital stock consists of:

     - 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share;

     - 5,000,000 shares of First Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share; and

     - 15,000,000 shares of Serial Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share,
       of which 1,250,000 have been designated as Series A Junior Participating
       Preferred Stock.

     As of the record date for the Chiles special meeting,        shares of
ENSCO common stock were issued and outstanding. No shares of ENSCO First
Preferred Stock or Serial Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

     Holders of ENSCO common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held
of record on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of ENSCO common stock.
Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred
stock, holders of ENSCO common stock are entitled to dividends as may be
declared from time to time by the ENSCO board of directors out of funds legally
available for that purpose. Holders of ENSCO common stock have no preemptive,
redemption, conversion or sinking fund rights. Subject to preferences that may
be applicable to any preferred stock, the holders of ENSCO common stock are
entitled to share equally and ratably in the assets of ENSCO, if any, remaining
after the payment of all debts and liabilities of ENSCO upon a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of ENSCO. All issued and outstanding shares of ENSCO
common stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The shares of
ENSCO common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ESV."

     There is a preferred share purchase right associated with each share of
ENSCO common stock, and the preferred share purchase rights trade with the
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. A description of the preferred
share purchase rights is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 89.

PREFERRED STOCK

FIRST PREFERRED STOCK

     The ENSCO board of directors is authorized to determine the dividend
rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of
redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms on any series of
First Preferred Stock, the number of shares constituting any series of First
Preferred Stock, and the designation of any series of First Preferred Stock.

     Dividends on outstanding shares of First Preferred Stock shall be paid or
declared and set apart for payment before any dividends shall be paid or
declared and set apart for payment on the shares of common stock or any
subordinate and inferior series of Serial Preferred Stock with respect to the
same dividend period.

     Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of ENSCO, if the assets
available for distribution to holders of shares of First Preferred Stock of all
series shall be insufficient to pay such holders the full preferential amount to
which they are entitled, such assets shall be distributed ratably among the
shares of all series of First Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective
preferential amounts (including unpaid cumulative dividends, if any) payable
with respect thereto.

     Shares of First Preferred Stock which have been redeemed or converted, or
which have been issued and reacquired in any manner and retired, shall have the
status of authorized and unissued First Preferred Stock and may be reissued by
the ENSCO board of directors as shares of the same or any other series, unless
otherwise provided with respect to any series in the resolution or resolutions
of the ENSCO board of directors creating such series.

SERIAL PREFERRED STOCK

     Dividends on outstanding shares of Serial Preferred Stock shall be paid or
declared and set apart for payment before any dividends shall be paid or
declared and set apart for payment on the shares of common stock with respect to
the same dividend period.

     Shares of Serial Preferred Stock which have been redeemed or converted, or
which have been issued and reacquired in any manner and retired, shall have the
status of authorized and unissued Serial Preferred Stock and may be reissued by
the ENSCO board of directors as shares of the same or any other series, unless
otherwise provided with respect to any series in the resolution or resolutions
of the ENSCO board of directors creating such series.

     The number of authorized shares of Serial Preferred Stock may be increased
or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the corporation
entitled to vote. Notwithstanding the above, the ENSCO board of directors may
grant powers, preferences and rights to any series of Serial Preferred Stock
which are on a parity with, or senior to, the powers, preferences and rights of
any series of First Preferred Stock, or the class of First Preferred Stock,
provided, that such series or class of First Preferred Stock shall have approved
such powers, preferences and rights by the vote specified in the terms and
provisions of such series of First Preferred Stock, or, if no such vote is
specified, by the vote of such series or class required by applicable law, if
any.

     In connection with ENSCO's rights agreement, the ENSCO board of directors
has designated 1,250,000 shares of Serial Preferred Stock as "Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock." See "Comparison of Stockholder Rights and
Corporate Governance Matters -- Stockholder Rights Plan" on page 84.

EXCHANGE AGENT

     The exchange agent of the ENSCO common stock is American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company.

       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

     ENSCO and Chiles are both incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Before the completion of the merger, the rights of holders of Chiles
common stock are governed by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of
Chiles and the bylaws of Chiles. After the completion of the merger, Chiles
stockholders will become stockholders of ENSCO, and their rights will be
governed by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ENSCO, the
bylaws of ENSCO, as amended, the Rights Agreement dated February 21, 1995
between ENSCO and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as amended on March
3, 1997, and the DGCL. We use the terms "charter" and "bylaws" in this summary
to describe the respective incorporation documents of ENSCO and Chiles
referenced above for ease of comparison.

     While there are substantial similarities between the charters and bylaws of
ENSCO and Chiles, a number of differences do exist and we have not included a
discussion of all the similarities between the rights of ENSCO stockholders and
the rights of Chiles stockholders. The following is only a summary of the
material differences between the rights of ENSCO stockholders and the rights of
Chiles stockholders. While we believe that this summary covers the material
differences between the two, this summary may not contain all of the information
that is important to you. It should also be read in conjunction with
"Description of ENSCO Capital Stock." This summary is not intended to be a
complete discussion of the respective rights of ENSCO and Chiles stockholders
and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL and the various
documents of ENSCO and Chiles we refer to in this summary. You should carefully
read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we refer to
in this proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete understanding of the
differences between being a stockholder of ENSCO and being a stockholder of
Chiles. ENSCO and Chiles have filed with the SEC their respective documents
referred to in this summary and will send copies of these documents to you upon
your request. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 89.

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     If the merger is consummated, a Chiles stockholder of record on the date of
making a written demand for appraisal, as described below, will be entitled to
have those shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 262
of the DGCL and to receive payment for the "fair value" of those shares instead
of the merger consideration. In order to be eligible to receive this payment,
however, a stockholder must: (a) continue to hold its shares through the
effective date of the merger; (b) strictly comply with the procedures discussed
under Section 262; and (c) not vote in favor of the merger or consent to the
merger in writing. Shares of Chiles common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the effective date of the merger, with respect to which appraisal has been
properly demanded in accordance with Section 262, will not be converted into the
right to receive the merger consideration at or after the effective date of the
merger unless and until the holder of such shares withdraws its demand for an
appraisal or becomes ineligible for an appraisal.

     Holders of ENSCO common stock outstanding at the effective date of the
merger are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

     This proxy statement/prospectus is being sent to all Chiles stockholders of
record on the record date for the Chiles special meeting and constitutes notice
of the appraisal rights available to those holders under Section 262. THE
STATUTORY RIGHT OF APPRAISAL GRANTED BY SECTION 262 IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES
STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES IN SECTION 262. FAILURE TO FOLLOW ANY OF
THESE PROCEDURES MAY RESULT IN A TERMINATION OR WAIVER OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER
SECTION 262. The following is a summary of the principal provisions of Section
262 and it is not a complete statement of Section 262. The following summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 which is incorporated by
reference, together with any amendments to the laws that may be approved and
adopted after the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus. A copy of Section
262 is attached as Annex G to this proxy statement/prospectus.

     A holder of Chiles common stock who elects to assert appraisal rights under
Section 262 must deliver a written demand for appraisal of its shares of Chiles
common stock prior to the vote on the merger. The written demand must identify
the stockholder of record and state the stockholder's intention to demand
appraisal of its shares. Voting against approval and adoption of the merger,
abstaining from voting or failing to vote with respect to approval and adoption
of the merger will not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262. All demands should be delivered to: Secretary, Chiles Offshore
Inc., 11200 Richmond Avenue, Suite 490, Houston, Texas 77082-2618. Only a Chiles
stockholder of record on the date of making a written demand for appraisal who
continuously holds those shares through the effective date of the merger is
entitled to seek appraisal. Demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the
Chiles stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as that stockholder's name
appears on the stockholder's stock certificates representing shares of Chiles
common stock.

     BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHO ARE NOT RECORD OWNERS AND WHO INTEND TO ASSERT
APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD INSTRUCT THE RECORD OWNER TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS BEFORE
THE DATE OF THE CHILES SPECIAL MEETING.

     Within 10 days after the merger, the surviving company in the merger is
required to send notice of the effectiveness of the merger to each stockholder
who prior to the time of the merger has complied with the requirements of
Section 262.

     Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving
company in the merger or any stockholder who has strictly complied with the
requirements of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Chiles
common stock held by all stockholders seeking appraisal. A dissenting
stockholder must serve a copy of the petition on the surviving company in the
merger. If no petition is filed by either Chiles, the surviving company or any
dissenting stockholder within the 120-day period, the rights of all dissenting
stockholders to an appraisal will cease. Stockholders seeking to assert
appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving company will file a
petition with respect to the appraisal of the fair value of their shares or that
the surviving company will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair
value of those shares. The surviving

company is under no obligation to and has no present intention to take any
action in this regard. Accordingly, stockholders who wish to seek an appraisal
of their shares should initiate all necessary action with respect to the
assertion of their appraisal rights within the same periods and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. FAILURE TO FILE THE PETITION ON A TIMELY BASIS WILL
CAUSE THE STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHT TO AN APPEAL TO CEASE.

     Within 120 days after the time of the merger, any stockholder who has
strictly complied with subsections (a) and (d) of Section 262 is entitled, upon
written request, to receive from the surviving company a statement setting forth
the total number of shares of Chiles common stock not voted in favor of the
merger with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of those shares. The statement must be mailed within
10 days after Chiles has received the written request or within 10 days after
the time for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of Section
262 has expired, whichever is later.

     If a petition for an appraisal is filed in a timely manner, at the hearing
on that petition the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares of
Chiles common stock owned by those stockholders. The court will determine the
fair value of those shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the fair value. The Delaware Court of Chancery
may require the stockholders who have demanded appraisal rights for their shares
of Chiles common stock and who hold certificates representing those shares to
submit the certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with any such
directions.

     Stockholders who consider appraisal should consider that the fair value of
their shares under Section 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than,
the value of the merger consideration without the exercise of appraisal rights.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the cost of the appraisal
proceeding and assess it against the parties as the court deems equitable. Upon
application of a dissenting stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts) be
charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Chiles common stock entitled
to appraisal. In the absence of a court determination or assessment, each party
bears its own costs.

     Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262
will not, after the effective date of the merger, be entitled to vote such stock
for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or other distributions, if any,
on the Chiles common stock, except for dividends or distributions, if any,
payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the effective date of the
merger.

     A stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger
consideration at any time within 60 days after the effective date of merger, or
thereafter may withdraw a demand for appraisal with the written approval of the
surviving company in the merger. If an appraisal proceeding is properly
instituted, it may not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and any such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems to be just. If, after the
merger, a Chiles stockholder of record who had demanded appraisal for its shares
fails to assert or effectively withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, those
shares will be treated under the merger agreement as if they were converted into
the right to receive the merger consideration at the time of the merger.

     IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL,
ANY CHILES STOCKHOLDER WHO IS CONSIDERING ASSERTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT A LEGAL ADVISOR.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The legality of ENSCO common stock offered by this proxy
statement/prospectus will be passed upon for ENSCO by its counsel, Baker &
McKenzie. Certain United States federal income tax consequences of the merger
will be passed upon for Chiles by Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP.

                                    EXPERTS

     The consolidated financial statements of ENSCO International Incorporated
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended, which
appear in the annual report on Form 10-K of ENSCO International Incorporated for
the year ended December 31, 2001, have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
independent certified public accountants, as set forth in their report included
therein and incorporated herein by reference. Such consolidated financial
statements of ENSCO International Incorporated are incorporated herein by
reference in reliance upon such report of Arthur Andersen LLP given on the
authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

     The consolidated financial statements of ENSCO International Incorporated
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and for each of the two years in
the period ended December 31, 2000, incorporated herein by reference to the
annual report on Form 10-K of ENSCO International Incorporated for the year
ended December 31, 2001, have been so incorporated in reliance on the report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, given on the authority of
said firm as experts in auditing and accounting.

     The consolidated financial statements of Chiles Offshore Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001, which appear in the annual report on Form
10-K of Chiles Offshore Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2001, have been
audited by Arthur Andersen LLP as set forth in their report included therein and
incorporated herein by reference. Such consolidated financial statements of
Chiles Offshore Inc. are incorporated herein by reference in reliance upon such
report of Arthur Andersen LLP given on the authority of such firm as experts in
accounting and auditing.

     With respect to the unaudited interim financial information of ENSCO
International Incorporated for the three month period ended March 31, 2002,
included (incorporated by reference) herein, KPMG LLP, independent certified
public accountants, has reported that they applied limited procedures in
accordance with professional standards for a review of such information.
However, their separate report included in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of
ENSCO International Incorporated for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2002,
and included (incorporated by reference) herein, states that they did not audit
and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information.
Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should
be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied.
KPMG LLP is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the
Securities Act of 1933 for their report on the unaudited interim financial
information because that report is not a "report" or a "part" of the
registration statement prepared or certified by KPMG LLP within the meaning of
Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

                 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2003 ANNUAL MEETING

     The 2003 annual meeting of Chiles stockholders will be held only if the
merger is not completed. If such meeting is held, stockholder proposals to be
presented at the 2003 annual meeting must be received by Chiles on or before
December 13, 2002, for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy card relating
to that meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Any such proposals should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to:
the Secretary of Chiles Offshore Inc., 11200 Richmond Avenue, Suite 490,
Houston, Texas 77082-2618. As a separate and distinct matter from proposals
under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in accordance with
Article 1, Section 1 of the bylaws of Chiles, in order for business to be
properly brought before the next annual meeting by a stockholder, such
stockholder must deliver to Chiles timely written notice thereof. To be timely,
a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of Chiles,

not less than 90 calendar days in advance of the anniversary date of the
previous year's annual meeting of stockholders (or if there was no such prior
annual meeting, not less than 90 calendar days prior to the date which
represents the second Tuesday in May of the current year); if, however, the date
of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than
60 days, from such anniversary date, then, to be considered timely, notice by
the stockholders must be received by Chiles not later than the close of business
on the later of (a) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (b) the seventh
day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was
mailed to stockholders or publicly disclosed.

                                MERGER AGREEMENT

     This Merger Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of May 14, 2002 by and among

at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Company shall be merged with

Following the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving
corporation ("Surviving Corporation"). The name of the Surviving Corporation

1.2  EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

a date to be specified by the parties ("Closing Date"), which shall be no later
than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Articles 6, 7 and 8 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Certificate of Merger")
shall be duly executed by Merger Sub and, simultaneously with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the

                                       A-1

State of Delaware ("Secretary of State"). The Merger shall become effective upon
the later of: (a) the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State, or (b) such later date and time as may be specified
in the Certificate of Merger with the consent of Parent ("Effective Time").

1.4  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     At the Effective Time:

          (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as amended at the
     Effective Time as set forth in Exhibit C, shall be the Certificate of
     Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
     applicable Law;

          (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be
     the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
     applicable Law; and

          (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
     immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals
     who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
     Effective Time.

1.5  CONVERSION OF SHARES

     (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or any stockholder of Company:

          (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
     Effective Time by Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Company (or
     held in Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
     to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

          (ii)  any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
     Effective Time by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary
     of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
     consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

          (iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
     1.5(a) and subject to Sections 1.5(b) and 1.5(c), each share of Company
     Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
     converted into the right to receive (A) 0.6575 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a
     share of Parent Common Stock (the "Common Stock Consideration") and (B)
     $5.25 in cash (the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock
     Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"); and

          (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of
     Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
     outstanding as a share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization
or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

     (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional
shares shall be issued. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in
cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

                                       A-2

1.6  CLOSING OF COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS

     At the Effective Time:

          (a) all certificates for shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate")
     shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
     all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
     that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
     to have any rights as stockholders of Company except as set forth in
     Sections 1.7 and 1.11; and

          (b) the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed with respect
     to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
     Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.
     If, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is
     presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7(a)) or to the
     Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
     canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

1.7  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     (a)  Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent in
respect of the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to or at the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable as the Common Stock Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iii)(A) and (ii) the amount of cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section
1.5(a)(iii)(B) and the aggregate amount of cash sufficient to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c) and any dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time to which holders of Company Stock
Certificates exchangeable for Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement are
entitled. The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with
the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the
Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the
"Exchange Fund."

     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming
that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange
Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
(x) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.5 and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash that
such holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5 (including any cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled as contemplated by this Section 1.7) and (y) each Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock)
as contemplated by Article 1 (including any dividends or other distributions as
contemplated by Section 1.7(d)). If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as

                                       A-3

Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Company Stock Certificate.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no Merger Consideration shall be paid in exchange for any Company Stock
Certificate to any Person who may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in
Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Company until such Person shall have
delivered to Parent and Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as
contemplated by Section 5.7.

     (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, to receive all such dividends
and distributions, without interest).

     (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Stock Certificates as of the date one year after the date on which
the Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter
look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

     (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or
under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

     (g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

1.8  STOCK OPTIONS

     (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the board of directors of Company
administering the Company Stock Option Plan) shall take such action as may be
required to effect the following provisions of this Section 1.8(a). Subject to
the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as of the Effective Time each
option to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plan (a "Company Stock Option") that is then outstanding shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an option (or a new substitute option shall be
granted) (an "Assumed Stock Option") exercisable for such amount of cash and
shares of Parent Company Stock as would have been received in respect of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option had such Company Stock Option
been exercised in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (such that,
immediately after the Effective Time, (i) a Company Stock Option for one share
of Company Common Stock shall be converted into an Assumed Stock Option
exercisable for the Merger Consideration at the exercise price in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any restriction on the exercise
of any such Company Stock Option and other provisions of such Company Stock
Option in effect at the Effective Time (after taking into account any vesting
that may result from the approval or consummation of the Merger) shall otherwise
remain unchanged; provided, however, that each Company Option assumed by Parent
in accordance with this Section 1.8 (and the cash to be received by the holder
upon exercise thereof) shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction.

                                       A-4

     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders' rights pursuant to the Company Option Plan and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and that such Company Stock
Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the provisions of this Section 1.8). Parent shall comply with
the terms of the Company Option Plan and ensure, to the extent required by, and
subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plan, that the Company Stock
Options which qualified as qualified stock options prior to the Effective Time
continue to qualify as qualified stock options after the Effective Time.

     (c) Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Company Option Plan pursuant to this Section 1.8, including
the reservation, issuance and using its Reasonable Efforts to provide for the
listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.8. Parent shall use its Reasonable Efforts to
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Assumed Stock Options and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements covering such Assumed Stock Options (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such Assumed Stock Options remain outstanding. With respect to
those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the Effective Time will be subject
to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where
applicable, Parent shall use all Reasonable Efforts to administer the Company
Option Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 1.8 in a manner that complies with
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Company Option
Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

1.9  TAX CONSEQUENCES

     For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to
this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.

1.10  FURTHER ACTION

     If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined
by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of Company and otherwise) to
take such action.

1.11  DISSENTING SHARES

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted as provided in Section 1.5 of this Agreement, unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his right
to appraisal and payment under the Delaware General Corporation Law. If, after
the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(a)(iii) hereof, together
with any dividends or distributions payable thereon or cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and to which such holder is entitled, without interest
thereon. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
Company for appraisal of Company Common Stock, and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle, any such

                                       A-5

demands. Parent covenants and agrees that, in the event any cash payment is to
be made following the Effective Time in respect of Dissenting Shares (as a
result of a judgment, settlement or otherwise), Parent shall contribute to the
capital of the Surviving Corporation an amount sufficient to make such payment,
and no funds or other assets of the Surviving Corporation shall, directly or
indirectly, be used for such purpose.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

     Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:

2.1  ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING

     (a) Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the Entities identified in
Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and neither Company nor any
of the other Entities identified in Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule owns any capital stock of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any
other Entity, other than the Entities identified in Section 2.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. (Company and each of the Entities identified on
Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are referred to collectively
in this Agreement as the "Acquired Companies.") None of the Acquired Companies
has agreed or is obligated to make, or is bound by any Contract under which it
may become obligated to make, any future investment in or capital contribution
to any other Entity. None of the Acquired Companies has, at any time, been a
general partner of any general partnership, limited partnership or other Entity.
Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the
jurisdiction of formation of each of the Acquired Companies and other
jurisdictions in which each Acquired Company is authorized to do business.

     (b) Company is a corporation, and each Subsidiary is a corporation or a
limited liability company, in each case duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full
corporate or other power and authority to conduct its business as presently
conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that it purports to own or
use, and to perform all its obligations under all Company Contracts to which it
is a party. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the
activities conducted by it, requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Company has delivered to Parent copies of the Governing Documents of
each of the Acquired Companies, as currently in effect. Neither Company nor any
Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its Governing Documents.

2.2  ENFORCEABILITY; NO CONFLICT

     (a) Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Company, enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms.
Other than the approval contemplated by Section 2.21, Company has the power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations

Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 2.15(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and, in each case, where non-compliance does not and is not

Liability for any excise tax, penalty or other liability under ERISA or the
Code. Other than routine claims for benefits submitted by participants or
beneficiaries, no material written claim against, or Proceeding involving, any

complies in form and in operation with the requirements of the Code and meets
the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Code Section 401(a) and a
