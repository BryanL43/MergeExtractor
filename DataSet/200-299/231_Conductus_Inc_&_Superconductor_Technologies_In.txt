NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OF
SUPERCONDUCTOR

To Be Held on December 17, 2002

To the Stockholders of Superconductor:

A special meeting of stockholders of
Superconductor Technologies Inc. (Superconductor), a Delaware
corporation, will be held at Superconductors principal
executive offices located at 460 Ward Drive Santa Barbara,
California 93111 on December 17, 2002, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, for the following purposes:

1.     To consider and
    vote upon a proposal to approve the merger of Conductus, Inc.
    (Conductus), a Delaware corporation, with and into
    Superconductor. This would be accomplished by merging STI
    Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Superconductor, with and into Conductus, under the
    terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger attached as

Annex A
. In the merger, stockholders of Conductus
    would receive 0.6 shares of newly issued common stock of
    Superconductor for each share of Conductus common stock owned.

2.     To consider and
    vote upon a proposal to approve the terms of
    Superconductors private financing transaction of
    approximately $20 million which would result in the
    issuance of stock concurrently with the closing of the merger.
    Stockholder approval is required under Nasdaq corporate
    governance rules because the shares were priced at a discount to
    the market price on the date of execution of the purchase
    agreement and the total number of shares issued at closing will
    exceed 20% of Superconductors outstanding common stock.
    The receipt of a minimum of $15 million of financing on
    these terms is a condition to the closing of the merger.

3.     To consider and
    vote upon a proposal to approve an amendment to
    Superconductors Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
    amended, increasing the authorized common stock of
    Superconductor from 75,000,000 shares to
    125,000,000 shares. An increase will facilitate
    Superconductors completion of the merger and the financing.

4.     To consider and
    vote upon a proposal to approve an amendment to
    Superconductors Restated Certificate of Incorporation that
    would enable Superconductors board of directors, at its
    discretion, to effect a reverse stock split of Superconductor
    common stock at an exchange ratio ranging from one newly issued
    share for each two outstanding shares to one newly issued share
    for each ten outstanding shares. The proposed amendment is
    attached as 
Annex B
 to this proxy statement/
    prospectus.

5.     To transact any
    other business that may properly come before the meeting or any
    adjournment or postponement thereof.

Superconductors common stock, referred to
as Superconductor stock, is currently traded on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol SCON. Record
holders of Superconductor stock at the close of business on
November 18, 2002, referred to as Superconductor
stockholders, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting. 
It is important that you vote. 
You are
cordially invited to attend the meeting. However, to ensure that
you are represented at the special meeting, 
please complete,
sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it as promptly
as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope
. If you
hold any shares of common stock in street name by a
broker, your broker will only vote your shares upon receiving
proper instructions with respect to casting your vote. You have
the right to revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by
giving Superconductor written notice of revocation by mail or by
facsimile, by submitting a subsequent proxy or by voting in
person at the special meeting. If you indicate no instructions
on your proxy card with respect to a proposal, Superconductor
will vote your shares 
FOR
 that proposal.

i



You should carefully consider the risk factors
relating to the merger, the financing proposal, the increase in
authorized shares, the reverse stock split proposal and
Superconductors business, which begin on page 19 of
the enclosed proxy statement/ prospectus.

Superconductors board of directors has
carefully considered the terms of each proposal, including the
proposed merger, and has determined that they are each in the
best interests of Superconductor and its stockholders, and
unanimously recommends that you vote 
FOR 
the
merger, the financing, increasing Superconductors
authorized shares, and the reverse stock split.

By Order of the Board of Directors of
    Superconductor

Matters To Be Considered At The
Meeting



Proposal One: 

The Merger Proposal

Under the merger proposal, Superconductor would
    acquire Conductus. This would be accomplished by the merger of a
    newly formed Delaware corporation wholly owned by
    Superconductor, STI Acquisition Inc., referred to as Merger Sub,
    with and into Conductus, with Conductus as the surviving
    corporation in the merger. The merger would be accomplished
    pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
    attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus as

Annex A
.

The Merger Consideration

Conductus stockholders will receive
    0.6 shares of Superconductor stock for each share of
    Conductus stock. Conductus stockholders will receive cash for
    any fractional shares of Superconductor stock they would
    otherwise be entitled to receive in the merger.

In the merger, Superconductor will issue more
    than 20% of its outstanding shares of stock (before giving
    effect to the merger and the financing transaction) to
    Conductus stockholders. Superconductor stock is traded on
    Nasdaq, and, as a result, Superconductor must comply with Nasdaq
    corporate governance rules. Nasdaqs corporate governance
    rules require stockholder approval for any acquisition pursuant
    to which the number of shares issued in the offering will be
    equal to or in excess of 20% of the numbers of shares of common
    stock outstanding before the transaction. Because Conductus
    stockholders will own in excess of 20% of Superconductors
    stock after the merger, Nasdaqs rules require
    Superconductors stockholders to approve the merger.

Reasons for the Merger

Superconductor considered a number of factors in
    its decision to pursue the merger, including the following:

  The acquisition of Conductus by
    Superconductor is expected to present numerous opportunities to
    streamline the combined businesses and integrate the
    capabilities of the two companies;

 The combined company is anticipated
    to present a more attractive investment opportunity and would
    likely be able to raise needed capital on more favorable terms
    than either company could individually;

 Superconductor and Conductus
    represent 30 years of collective experience in superconductor
    technology and together expect to accelerate the wide scale
    deployment of the technology in the telecommunications industry;

 With combined revenues expected to be
    between $27 and $30 million by fiscal year 2002, the new
    Superconductor is expected to reach critical mass sooner than
    either company could have achieved on its own; and

 The combined company should be a
    stronger force within the wireless sub-system equipment market,
    and should be well positioned to benefit from the deployment of
    new cell sites.

The Effect of the Merger

If the merger is approved:

 Conductus would become a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Superconductor.



 Conductus stock would cease to
    be publicly traded.

 The Superconductor Certificate would
    continue to be the certificate of incorporation of
    Superconductor, except that if Proposal 3 is adopted, an
    amendment will be filed to increase the shares of authorized
    common stock to 125,000,000 and if proposal 4 is adopted the
    amendment attached as 
Annex B
 will be adopted.

 Superconductors board of
    directors would be expanded from eight (8) to
    twelve (12) members, consisting of all eight (8) of
    the current directors of Superconductor, three (3) new
    directors from the board of Conductus and one (1) new
    director chosen by certain investors in the private financing
    affiliated with the Special Situations family of funds (the
    Special Situations Funds). The three new directors from
    Conductus will be Martin A. Kaplan, David L. Short and Charles
    E. Shalvoy. The Special Situations Funds appointee will be
    Robert J. Majteles.

 Mr. Charles E. Shalvoy, the
    President and Chief Executive Officer of Conductus, will remain
    President of the Conductus subsidiary and will become an
    Executive Vice President of Superconductor. Other than this
    addition, the executive officers of Superconductor immediately
    before the merger will continue to be executive officers of
    Superconductor after the merger.

 After giving effect to the merger and
    the private financing transaction discussed in proposal 2
    below, Conductus stockholders would own approximately 23% of
    Superconductors stock then outstanding. However, this
    percentage does not take into account the fact that some
    Conductus stockholders already own shares of Superconductor
    stock or that they will acquire additional shares of
    Superconductor stock in the financing.

Recommendation of the Superconductor
    Board

Superconductors board of directors has
    unanimously approved and recommends that you vote

FOR 
the merger and the approval of the merger
    agreement. See the section entitled The Merger 
    Recommendation of Superconductor Board of Directors on
    page 40.

Vote Required

The merger must be approved by a majority of
    votes cast by Superconductor stockholders at the special meeting.

Failure to Vote; Abstentions

If you fail to send in your proxy card, you will
    not be counted for purposes of constituting a quorum and will
    not be counted for purposes of determining a majority of votes
    cast at the special meeting. Withheld votes, and
    broker non-votes by Superconductor stockholders will
    be counted towards determining a quorum, but will not be counted
    towards the number of votes cast, and, therefore, will not be
    counted for purposes of determining a majority of votes cast at
    the special meeting.

If you abstain from voting on this proposal by
    marking 
ABSTAIN 
on your proxy card or ballot,
    your vote will be counted both towards determining a quorum for
    the special meeting and will be counted among the number of
    votes cast on the merger



proposal. Therefore, if you

ABSTAIN, 
your vote will be effectively cast

AGAINST 
the proposal. The financing
    transaction and the merger are each conditioned on the other.
    Therefore, both proposals must be approved for either
    transaction to be effected. In addition, the increase in
    authorized shares has been included primarily to facilitate the
    merger and the financing. If you vote 
FOR 
the
    financing proposal, you should also vote 
FOR

the merger proposal and 
FOR
 the proposed
    increase in authorized shares.

No Dissenters or Appraisal
    Rights

Superconductor stockholders will not be entitled
    to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware
    General Corporation Law in connection with the merger or the
    exchange of Conductus stock into shares of Superconductor stock.

Proposal Two: 

The Financing Proposal

The financing proposal seeks Superconductor
    stockholder approval for a private financing transaction of
    approximately $20 million, which would result in the
    issuance of Superconductor stock and warrants to purchase
    Superconductor stock concurrently with the closing of the
    merger. The financing would be made pursuant to a securities
    purchase agreement dated October 10, 2002, as amended.

The financing transaction and the merger are each
    conditioned on each other. Therefore both transactions must be
    approved for either transaction to be effected.

Terms of Stock Sale

In the transaction, Superconductor will sell
    21,096,954 shares of unregistered common stock, in excess of 20%
    of the outstanding shares of Superconductor stock before giving
    effect to the merger and the financing transaction, at a
    purchase price of $0.95 per share. This was a below market price
    when the securities purchase agreement was signed. The investors
    also will acquire warrants to purchase an additional 5,274,240
    shares with an above market exercise price. Under Nasdaqs
    rules, market price is the closing price for
    Superconductors stock on the date of execution of the
    purchase agreement.

The Nasdaq corporate governance rules require
    stockholder approval of unregistered common stock issuances
    priced at a discount to the market on the date of execution of
    the purchase agreement if the proposed issuance would result in
    the issuance of 20% or more of the common stock or voting power
    of the company before the issuance. To comply with Nasdaqs
    rules, Superconductors stockholders are being asked to
    approve the private financing transaction.

Recommendation of the Superconductor
    Board

Superconductors board of directors has
    unanimously approved and recommends that you vote

FOR
 the financing transaction. See section
    entitled Superconductors Proposal for a Private
    Financing  Board Recommendation on
    page 153.

Vote Required

A majority of the votes cast by Superconductor
    stockholders must affirmatively approve the financing proposal
    at the special meeting.



Failure to Vote; Abstentions

If you fail to send in you proxy card, you will
    not be counted for purposes of constituting a quorum and will
    not be counted for purposes of determining a majority of votes
    cast at the special meeting. Withheld votes, and
    broker non-votes by Superconductor stockholders will
    be counted towards determining a quorum, but will not be counted
    towards the number of votes cast, and, therefore, will not be
    counted for purposes of determining a majority of votes cast at
    the special meeting.

If you abstain from voting on this proposal by
    marking 
ABSTAIN
 on your proxy card or ballot,
    your vote will be counted both towards determining a quorum for
    the special meeting and will be counted among the number of
    votes cast on the financing proposal. Therefore, if you

ABSTAIN
 your vote will be effectively cast

AGAINST
 the proposal. The financing
    transaction and the merger are each conditioned on the other.
    Therefore, both proposals must be approved for either
    transaction to be effected. In addition, the increase in
    authorized shares has been included primarily to facilitate the
    merger and the financing. If you vote 
FOR
 the
    merger proposal, you should also vote 
FOR
 the
    financing proposal and 
FOR
 the proposed
    increase in authorized shares.

Proposal Three: 

Increase in Authorized Shares of Superconductor
    Stock

Superconductors stockholders are being
    asked to approve a proposed amendment to Superconductors
    Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, referred to
    as the Superconductor Certificate, to increase the number of
    authorized shares of Superconductor common stock from
    75,000,000 shares to 125,000,000 shares. After giving
    effect to the merger and the financing, Superconductor would
    have more than 75,000,000 shares outstanding and issuable
    upon exercise of options and warrants. Therefore, an increase
    will facilitate Superconductors ability to meet its
    commitments under the terms of the merger and the financing and
    fully reserve for all shares issuable upon exercise of options
    and warrants.

Superconductor will abandon the increase in
    authorized shares under this proposal 3 if the merger and
    financing are not consummated.

Principal Reasons for Proposal

The principal purpose for the increase is to
    facilitate the merger and the financing. However, the increase
    also includes additional shares that may be used in connection
    with possible stock splits or dividends, additional
    acquisitions, equity financings, management incentive and
    employee benefit plans, investments, and for other purposes.
    Except for the merger and the financing described in this proxy
    statement/ prospectus, Superconductor does not have any present
    plans to issue or use the proposed additional shares of common
    stock in acquisitions or otherwise, but expects to explore
    potential acquisitions from time to time as opportunities arise.



Effect on Superconductor Stock, Options and
    Warrants

Increasing the number of authorized shares would
    have no effect on the number of outstanding shares of
    Superconductor stock or issuable upon exercise of options or
    warrants. Superconductor currently has authorized preferred
    stock of 2,000,000 shares, which will not be affected by
    this proposal.

Recommendation of the Superconductor
    Board

Superconductors board of directors has
    unanimously approved and recommends that you vote
    
FOR
 the an increase in the number of
    authorized shares of Superconductor stock. See
    Superconductors Proposal to Increase its Authorized
    Common Stock  Board Recommendation on
    page 156.

This proposal is contingent upon the merger in
    proposal 1 and the financing in proposal 2, and
    Superconductors board of directors will implement this
    increase in the authorized common stock only if the merger and
    financing are approved and consummated.

Vote Required

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
    majority of the shares of Superconductor stock outstanding on
    the record date is required to approve the increase in
    authorized shares proposal.

If you fail to send in your proxy card, or
    abstain with respect to the reverse stock split proposal your
    vote will have the effect of voting 
AGAINST

    the increase in authorized shares proposal.

To facilitate the merger and the concurrent
    financing transaction, the number of authorized shares of
    Superconductor stock should be increased. Therefore, if you
    voted 
FOR 
the merger in proposal 1 and
    the financing in proposal 2, you should also vote

FOR 
the approval of this proposal 3.

Proposal Four: 

The Reverse Stock Split

Superconductors stockholders are being
    asked to approve a proposed amendment to Superconductors
    Certificate to effect a reverse stock split of Superconductor
    stock at an exchange ratio ranging from one newly issued share
    for each two outstanding shares to one newly issued share for
    each ten outstanding shares. Although Superconductor is seeking
    stockholder approval, Superconductors board of directors
    will have the discretion to postpone or cancel the reverse stock
    split.

Effect on Superconductor Stock, Options and
    Warrants

A reverse stock split would decrease the number
    of outstanding shares of Superconductor stock, thereby
    increasing the number of shares of Superconductor stock that are
    authorized but which are unissued. As of October 22, 2002,
    Superconductor had outstanding options and warrants to purchase
    6,124,622 shares, including unvested warrants to purchase
    585,560 shares, of Superconductor stock, all of which include
    provision for adjustments in the event of a reverse stock split,
    including exercise prices which will be proportionally adjusted.

Recommendation of the Superconductor
    Board

Superconductors board of directors has
    unanimously approved and recommends that you vote

FOR
 the reverse stock split. See



Superconductors Proposal for a
    Reverse Stock Spilt  Board Recommendation on
    page 159.

Vote Required

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
    majority of the shares of Superconductor stock outstanding on
    the record date is required to approve the reverse stock split
    proposal.

If you fail to send in your proxy card, instruct
    your broker or nominee on how you would like him or her to vote
    your shares with respect to the reverse stock split proposal, or
    if you abstain with respect to the reverse stock split proposal,
    your vote will have the effect of voting

AGAINST
 the reverse stock split proposal.

    to carefully consider the risk factors set forth in this proxy
    statement/ prospectus. See Risk Factors beginning on
    page 19.

Matters To Be Considered At The
Meeting

Proposal One

The Merger Proposal

Under the merger proposal, Superconductor would
    acquire Conductus. This would be accomplished by the merger of a
    newly formed Delaware corporation wholly owned by
    Superconductor, Merger Sub, with and into Conductus, with
    Conductus as the surviving corporation in the merger. The merger
    would be accom-



plished pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
    and Plan of Merger, attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus
    as 
Annex A
.

The Merger Consideration

Conductus stockholders will receive 0.6 shares of
    Superconductor stock for each share of Conductus stock.
    Conductus stockholders will receive cash for any fractional
    shares of Superconductor stock they would otherwise be entitled
    to receive in the merger.

Reasons for the Merger

Conductus management has identified
    significant complementary strengths and products between the two
    companies and believes that the combined company has the
    potential to:

 be a much stronger force within the
    wireless sub-system equipment market;

 leverage global presence in sales,
    support and alliances;

 achieve synergies and reduce costs
    through the integration of the operations of the two companies
    and the elimination of redundant manufacturing overhead expenses
    as well as duplicate sales, marketing and administrative
    functions;

 integrate the individual companies
    complementary technologies to potentially expand and enhance the
    overall product offering to existing and prospective customers;

 grow more rapidly than Conductus can
    grow as an independent company in the wireless
    telecommunications equipment market.

The Effect of the Merger

If the merger is approved:

 Conductus would become a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Superconductor.

 Conductus stock would cease to
    be publicly traded.

 The Superconductor Certificate would
    continue to be the certificate of incorporation of
    Superconductor, except that if Proposal 3 is adopted, an
    amendment will be filed to increase the shares of authorized
    common stock to 125,000,000 and if Proposal 4 is adopted,
    the amendment attached as 
Annex B
 may be adopted.

 Superconductors board of
    directors would be expanded from eight (8) to twelve (12)
    members, consisting of all eight (8) of the current directors of
    Superconductor, three (3) new directors from the board of
    Conductus and one (1) new director chosen by certain investors
    in the private financing affiliated with the Special Situations
    Funds. The three new directors from Conductus will be
    Martin A. Kaplan, David L. Short and Charles E.
    Shalvoy. The Special Situations Funds appointee will be
    Robert J. Majteles.

 Mr. Charles E. Shalvoy, the
    President and Chief Executive Officer of Conductus, will remain
    President of the Conductus subsidiary and will become an
    Executive Vice President of Superconductor. Other than this
    addition, the executive officers of Superconductor immediately
    before the merger will continue to be executive officers of
    Superconductor after the merger.



 After giving effect to the merger and
    the private financing transaction discussed in proposal 2
    below, Conductus stockholders would own approximately 23% of
    Superconductors stock then outstanding. However, this
    percentage does not take into account the fact that some
    Conductus stockholders already own shares of Superconductor
    stock or that they will acquire additional shares of
    Superconductor stock in the financing.

Recommendation of the Conductus
    Board

Conductuss board of directors has
    unanimously approved and recommends that you vote

FOR
 the merger and the approval of the merger
    agreement. See The Merger  Recommendation of
    Conductus Board of Directors on page 47.

Vote required

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
    majority of the shares of Conductus stock outstanding on the
    record date is required to approve the merger.

If you fail to instruct your broker on how you
    would like him or her to vote your shares, your actions will
    have the same effect as a vote 
AGAINST
 the
    merger agreement and the merger. If you submit a proxy that
    indicates an abstention from voting on all matters presented at
    the special meeting, your proxy will have the same effect as a
    vote 
AGAINST
 the merger agreement and the
    merger.

No Dissenters or Appraisal
    Rights

Conductus stockholders will not be entitled to
    appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law in connection with the merger or the exchange of
    Conductus stock into shares of Superconductor stock.

merger, the executive officers of Superconductor will retain
their positions at the combined company. In addition,
Charles E. Shalvoy, the current President and Chief
Executive of Conductus will be appointed an Executive Vice
President of Superconductor and President of the post-merger
Conductus subsidiary.

Q:     What are the
expected United States federal income tax consequences of the
merger? (See page 57)

A:     Conductus and
Superconductor have structured the merger so that, in general,
Conductus, Superconductor and their respective stockholders will
not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes in the merger, except with respect to cash received by
Conductus stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of
Superconductor stock.

Q:     What are the
conditions that must be satisfied for the merger to occur? (See
page 65)

A:     Completion of the
merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions, including:

 

receipt of the required vote from the
    stockholders of Superconductor and Conductus to approve the
    merger;

 

concurrent closing of the Superconductor
    financing for a minimum of $15 million;



 

the registration statement, of which this proxy
    statement/prospectus is a part, must be declared and remain
    effective with the SEC;

 

no law, regulation or order preventing the
    completion of the merger is in effect and any required consents
    must be obtained;

 

the shares of Superconductor stock to be issued
    in the merger must be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
    National Market; and

 

Superconductors board of directors must
    have been increased from 8 members to 12 members, and
    3 members of Conductus board of directors and the
    Special Situations Funds nominee will have been appointed to
    fill the newly created vacancies.

Q:     Does the
merger agreement permit termination of the merger? (See
page 67)

A:     Yes. Conductus
and Superconductor may mutually agree to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger. Additionally, either
Conductus or Superconductor may terminate the merger agreement
under any of the following circumstances:

 

if the merger is not completed by
    February 15, 2003;

 

if a final court order prohibiting the merger is
    issued and is not appealable;

 

if the stockholders of either company do not
    provide the required approvals; or

 

if the conditions to completion of the merger
    would not be satisfied because the other party breaches a
    representation or warranty in the merger agreement which results
    in a material adverse effect or fails to comply in all material
    respects with a covenant or agreement in the merger agreement
    which is not cured within 30 days of notice.

Superconductor may also terminate the merger
agreement for any of a number of Conductus actions set forth in
the merger agreement. Most of these events relate to the actions
of Conductus in pursuing or responding to a competing
transaction. Conductus also may terminate the merger agreement
in the event of a specific set of actions set forth in the
merger agreement. The most significant of these actions is the
acceptance by Conductus of a superior proposal as defined in the
merger agreement.

Q:     Could
Conductus be required to pay a termination fee? (See
page 68)

A:     Yes. If the
merger agreement is terminated by Conductus because of its
acceptance of a superior competing proposal, Conductus will be
required to pay to Superconductor a termination fee of 3% of the
aggregate consideration received in consummation of the superior
competing proposal.

Q:     May Conductus
negotiate with other parties? (See page 62)

A:     No. Conductus
has agreed, subject to limited exceptions for responses to
unsolicited bona fide offers, not to initiate or engage in
discussions with another party concerning a business combination
with a party other than Superconductor while the merger is
pending. If another party makes an unsolicited written proposal
to Conductus for a transaction that Conductus board of
directors believes in good faith, after consultation with
Conductus financial advisor, would, if consummated, be
more favorable to the Conductus stockholders than the merger
with Superconductor and the failure to withdraw or change its
recommendation would be inconsistent with the boards
fiduciary duties, the merger agreement permits Conductus
board of directors to withdraw or change its recommendation in
favor of the merger.

Q: Are there restrictions on the ability to
sell Superconductor stock received as a result of the merger?
(See page 59)

A:     No. All
Superconductor stock received by Conductus stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable, unless
the holder is considered an affiliate of Conductus under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Superconductor stock issued
to Conductus affiliates in the merger may only be sold pursuant
to a registration statement under the Securities Act, in
compliance with volume and other limitations imposed by



Rule 145 of the Securities Act or in the
opinion of counsel pursuant to an exemption from registration.
Generally, an affiliate is considered to be someone who is an
executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns
more than 10% of the outstanding stock of a company. Pursuant to
the merger agreement, affiliates of Conductus must execute an
affiliates agreement prior to closing specifically acknowledging
these limitations.

Reasons for the Merger

Q:     Why are
Superconductor and Conductus proposing the merger? (See
pages 39 and 45)

A:     Superconductors
and Conductus management have identified significant
complementary strengths between the two companies and believe
that the combined company has the potential to:

 

be a much stronger force within the wireless
    sub-system equipment market;

 

present a more attractive investment opportunity
    and would likely be able to raise capital on more favorable
    terms than either company individually;

 

leverage global presence in sales, support and
    alliances;

 

achieve synergies and reduce costs through the
    integration of the operations of the two companies and the
    elimination of redundant manufacturing overhead expenses as well
    as duplicate sales, marketing and administrative functions; and

 

integrate the individual companies
    complementary technologies to potentially expand and enhance the
    overall product offering to existing and prospective customers.

Q:     Do the boards
of directors of Superconductor and Conductus recommend voting in
favor of the merger? (See pages 40 and 47)

A:     Yes. Both the
Conductus board of directors and the Superconductor board of
directors have unanimously approved, and recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of, adopting and approving the merger
agreement and approving the merger. For a more complete
description of the recommendations of the boards of directors of
both companies, see the sections entitled The
Merger  Superconductors Reasons for the
Merger on page 39, and The Merger 
Conductus Reasons for the Merger on page 45.

Q:     Do persons
involved in the merger have interests which may conflict with
mine as a Conductus stockholder? (See page 53)

A:     Yes. When
considering the recommendations of Conductus board of
directors, you should be aware that certain Conductus directors
and officers have interests in the merger that are different
from, or are in addition to, yours. These interests include the
appointment of three current Conductus board members to the
Superconductor board of directors, the appointment of the
Special Situations Funds nominee to the Superconductor board,
the addition of the Alloy Ventures nominee to the Superconductor
board at the next annual meeting, the indemnification of
directors and officers of Conductus against certain liabilities
for events that occurred or may occur before the merger is
completed and the effectiveness of stock option extension
agreements for Conductus non-employee board members. In
addition, Conductus executive officers and certain key
employees have entered into change in control agreements with
Conductus which entitle such persons to severance benefits upon
a qualifying termination of employment within thirty-six months
of consummation of this merger. These severance benefits include
salary continuation payments, accelerated vesting of equity
securities and post-termination continuation of health/life
insurance benefits. The change in control arrangements are more
fully described in the Employment and Change in Control
Agreements section on page 54.

Q:     Do persons
involved in the merger have interests which may conflict with
mine as a Superconductor stockholder? (See
page 45)

A:     Yes. When
considering the recommendations of Superconductors board
of directors, you should be aware that certain Superconductor
directors have interests in the merger that are different from,
or are in



addition to, yours. Two directors of
Superconductor are affiliated with The Hillman Company which is
a significant Superconductor stockholder and which is a
significant investor in the financing.

Q:     Did
Superconductors and Conductus financial advisors
render favorable opinions concerning the merger? (See
pages 40 and 47)

A:     Yes. In
connection with its decision to approve and recommend the
merger, Superconductors board of directors considered the
opinion it received dated October 4, 2002, from its
financial advisor, Standard & Poors Corporate
Value Consulting (S&P CVC), as to the fairness
as of such date, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Superconductor stock, of the per share merger consideration
exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement.
Superconductor stockholders are urged to read S&P CVCs
opinion carefully and in its entirety to understand the
procedures followed, the assumptions made, the matters
considered and the limitations on the review undertaken by
S&P CVC in rendering its opinion. S&P CVCs opinion
was directed to the Superconductor board of directors and does
not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any
matter relating to the merger.

In connection with its decision to approve and
recommend the merger, Conductus board of directors
considered the opinion it received dated October 8, 2002,
from Conductus financial advisor, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, as to the fairness as of such date, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Conductus stock, of the per
share merger consideration exchange ratio provided for in the
merger agreement. Conductus stockholders are urged to read
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays opinion carefully and in
its entirety to understand the procedures followed, the
assumptions made, the matters considered and the limitations on
the review undertaken by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
rendering its opinion. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays
opinion was directed to the Conductus board of directors and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
any matter relating to the merger.

The written opinions of the financial advisors do
not address the prices at which Superconductors stock will
trade after the proposed merger nor do they represent a
recommendation by either S&P CVC or U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray that Superconductor stockholders or Conductus
stockholders vote in favor of the merger, or any other matters
set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Other Matters to Consider

Q:     Are there
risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the
merger? (See page 19)

A:     Yes. In
evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors
discussed in the section titled Risk Factors
beginning on page 19.

Q:     Am I entitled
to dissenters or appraisal rights? (See
page 59)

A:     No. Under
Delaware law, neither Superconductor nor Conductus stockholders
are entitled to dissenters or appraisal rights.

Q:     How do the
market prices of Superconductor and Conductus stock compare?
(See page 71)

A.     Shares of
Superconductor stock and Conductus stock are listed on the
Nasdaq National Market. Superconductors trading symbol is
SCON and Conductus trading symbol is
CDTS. On October 10, 2002, the last full
trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed
merger, the last reported sale prices were:

 

$1.03 per share of Superconductor stock; and

 

$0.49 per share of Conductus stock.

Superconductor and Conductus urge you to obtain
current market quotations.



Why Superconductor Stockholders Are Being
Asked to Approve Proposals Other than the Merger

Q:     Is the merger
conditioned upon the approval of any other proposal? (See
pages 152 and 153)

A:     Yes.
Proposal 2, the financing transaction, and the merger are
each conditioned on the other. Therefore both proposals must be
approved for either transaction to be consummated.
Superconductor stockholders voting 
FOR
 the
merger, should also vote 
FOR
 proposal 2.

Q:     Why does
Superconductor want to increase its authorized shares of common
stock, as described in proposal 3? (See pages 154
through 156)

A:     Increasing the
number of authorized shares of Superconductor stock would
facilitate the merger and the financing transaction.
Superconductor currently has 75,000,000 shares of authorized
common stock. After giving effect to the merger and financing,
Superconductor would have more than 75,000,000 shares
outstanding and issuable upon exercise of options reserved for
issuance under its stock option plans and warrants. Increasing
the number of its authorized shares would enable Superconductor
to meet its commitments in the merger and the financing, as well
as fully reserve for all shares issuable upon exercise of
options and warrants. Superconductor stockholders voting

FOR
 the merger and the financing transaction,
are encouraged to also vote
 FOR

proposal 3. Superconductor will abandon the increase in
authorized common stock if the merger and the financing do not
occur.

Q:     Why is
Superconductor also soliciting approval of a reverse stock split
in proposal 4? (See pages 156 through 159)

A:     Superconductor
believes that the low market value of Superconductor stock
impairs its acceptability to important segments of the financial
community and the investing public. If proposal 4 is
approved, Superconductors board of directors may effect a
reverse stock split within one year from the date of the special
meeting without further stockholder approval. If and when
effected, the reverse stock split would be intended to increase
the stocks market price, insure compliance with
Nasdaqs market price minimums, increase investor interest
and eliminate certain other market factors that disfavor
securities trading at a low market value. Although
proposal 4 is independent of the merger in proposal 1,
the financing in proposal 2, and the increase in authorized
Superconductor stock in proposal 3, Superconductors
board of directors recommends that Superconductor stockholders
vote 
FOR
 proposal 4.

Steps for You to Take Now

Q:     As a Conductus
stockholder, what do I need to do now? (See
page 9)

A:     Mail your signed
proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible
so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting.
If you return a properly signed proxy card but do not include
instructions on how to vote your proxy, your shares will be
voted 
FOR
 the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the merger.

Q:     Should I send
in my Conductus stock certificate now? (See
page 56)

A:     No. After the
merger is completed, we will send written instructions,
including a letter of transmittal, that explain how to exchange
Conductus stock for Superconductor stock. Please do not send in
any Conductus stock certificates until you receive these written
instructions and the letter of transmittal. Superconductor
stockholders will keep their current stock certificates.

Q:     As a
Superconductor stockholder, what do I need to do now? (See
page 2)

A:     Mail your signed
proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible
so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting.
If you return a properly signed proxy card but do not include
instructions on how to vote your proxy, your shares will be
voted 
FOR
 the approval of the proposals
submitted to Superconductor stockholders in this proxy
statement/ prospectus, including the merger proposal.



Q:     If my broker
holds my shares in street name, will my broker vote
my shares for me? (See pages 2 and 9)

A:     No. Your broker
will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from
you. If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions,
your shares will not be considered to have been voted in favor
of the proposals and therefore will have the effect of a vote

AGAINST
 the merger if you are a Conductus
stockholder and will have no effect if you are a Superconductor
stockholder.

Q:     What do I do
if I want to change my vote? (See pages 2 and 9)

A:     If you are a
stockholder of record and you want to change your vote, send the
secretary of Superconductor or Conductus, as appropriate, a
written notice that you wish to revoke your proxy; send the
secretary of Superconductor or Conductus, as appropriate, a
later-dated, signed proxy card before your special meeting; or
attend your special meeting in person and vote in person. If you
are a beneficial owner and you want to change your vote, submit
new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee; or
obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee that
gives you the right to vote your shares and attend your special
meeting and vote in person.

Q:     When and where
will the votes take place? (See pages i and iii)

Superconductor

A:     The
Superconductor special meeting of stockholders will be held at
Superconductors headquarters at 460 Ward Drive, Santa
Barbara, CA 93111 on December 17, 2002, starting at

special meeting of stockholders will be held at Conductus
headquarters at 969 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale,
California 94085 on December 17, 2002, starting at
10 a.m., local time.

Other documents to review (See
page A-1)

This summary does not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read carefully
this entire document and the other documents we refer to for a
more complete understanding of the merger. In particular,
holders of Superconductor and Conductus stock should read the
merger agreement, which is attached hereto as

Annex A
.



RISK FACTORS

The merger involves a high degree of risk for
the stockholders of Superconductor and Conductus.
Conductuss stockholders will be choosing to invest in
Superconductor common stock by voting in favor of approving the
merger proposal. An investment in Superconductor common stock
involves a high degree of risk. The stockholders of Conductus
and Superconductor are being asked to decide to combine the
businesses of Superconductor and Conductus, which will change
the business of both companies and will involve significant
risks. In addition to the other information contained or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus,
both Conductus and Superconductor stockholders should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote
for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger, and refer to the matters discussed under
the caption Forward-looking Statements on
page 1 of this proxy statement/ prospectus.

Risks Related to the Merger

The shares of Superconductor common stock
to be received by Conductus stockholders in the proposed
merger may decrease in value before the merger
occurs.

The number of shares of Superconductor common
stock that Conductus stockholders will receive in the proposed
merger for their shares of Conductus common stock is fixed and
will not change, even if the market price of Superconductor
common stock changes. There will be no adjustment to the
exchange ratio or right to terminate the merger agreement or the
merger based solely on fluctuations in the price of
Superconductor common stock. In recent years, the stock market
has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These
market fluctuations have adversely affected the market price of
Superconductor common stock and may do so again in the future.
The market price of Superconductor common stock upon and after
completion of the proposed merger could be lower than the market
price on the date the merger agreement was entered into or lower
than the current market price. You should obtain recent market
quotations of Superconductor common stock.

Integration of the two businesses may be
difficult to achieve, which may adversely affect
operations.

The proposed merger involves risks related to the
integration and management of technology, sales force,
operations and personnel of two companies. The integration of
the businesses of Superconductor and Conductus will be a
complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt
their businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient
manner. Following the merger, Superconductor and Conductus must
operate as a combined organization utilizing common information
and communications systems, operating procedures, financial
controls and human resources practices.

Superconductor and Conductus may encounter
substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in
integrating their operations, including:

 

potential conflicts between business cultures;

 

adverse changes in business focus perceived by
    third-party constituencies;

 

potential conflicts in distribution, marketing or
    other important relationships;

 

inability to implement uniform standards,
    controls, procedures and policies;

 

integration of research and development and
    product development efforts; and

 

loss of key employees and/or the diversion of
    managements attention from other ongoing business concerns.

In addition, Conductus is headquartered in
Northern California and Superconductor is headquartered in
Southern California. The geographic distance between the
companies and their respective offices and operations and the
consolidation of operations increase the risk that the
integration will not be completed successfully or in a timely
and cost-effective manner. Management of the combined company
may not be



successful in overcoming these risks or any other
problems encountered in connection with the integration of the
companies.

The costs to complete the proposed merger
are substantial. These costs and the manner of accounting for
the merger may affect Superconductors reported results of
operations after the merger.

It is anticipated that Superconductor and
Conductus will incur approximately $2 million of costs to
complete the proposed merger. This does not include costs
associated with combining the businesses of the two companies,
such as integration costs and costs associated with the
consolidation of operations which will be charged as an expense
and will reduce the earnings or increase the loss of
Superconductor in the period when charged. Superconductor and
Conductus may also recognize certain other expenses in
connection with the merger. The costs to complete the merger,
consisting primarily of fees and expenses paid to financial
advisors, attorneys and accountants, will be a component of the
purchase price and capitalized as an element of goodwill.
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least
annually and the combined company will be required to record a
charge to earnings in any period that impairment of goodwill is
determined.

Management of Superconductor after the proposed
merger may not be able to effectively control the costs
associated with the integration of the two companies. These
costs may also be higher than anticipated. If integration costs
are not managed effectively or if they are higher than
anticipated then Superconductors financial results after
the merger and its stock price could be materially adversely
affected.

A substantial amount of these costs and expenses
will be incurred whether or not the merger is completed.

If Superconductor does not successfully
integrate Conductus or the mergers benefits do not meet
the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts,
the market price of Superconductor common stock may
decline.

The market price of Superconductor common stock
may decline as a result of the merger for many reasons,
including:

 

the integration of Superconductor and Conductus
    may not be completed in a timely and efficient manner;

 

perceived benefits of the merger are not achieved
    as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated;

 

Superconductors assumptions about
    Conductuss business model and operations, such as the
    ability of Superconductor to move the manufacturing of
    Conductuss products to Superconductors facilities,
    may prove incorrect;

 

the effect of the proposed merger on
    Superconductors financial results after the merger may not
    be consistent with the expectations of financial or industry
    analysts; or

 

significant stockholders of Superconductor
    following the proposed merger may decide to dispose of their
    shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with
    their expectations.

Commercial product revenue growth could be
adversely affected if Superconductor is unable to convert
Conductus customers to the SuperFilter product
line.

Conductus primary commercial product line
is the ClearSite front-end receiver system for cellular
and personal communication services cell sites.
Superconductors primary commercial product line is the
SuperFilter front-end receiver system. Superconductor plans to
consolidate the two commercial product lines based on the
SuperFilter platform. The consolidation of the product
lines will require significant time, and Superconductor plans in
the interim to offer the Conductus customers its current
SuperFilter product line. In order to successfully transition
and retain the Conductus customers, Superconductor must convince
those customers that the SuperFilter product meets their
performance requirements at a cost-effective price. These
customers could elect to purchase other front-end solutions,
such as conventional filter technology, tower-top amplifiers and
smart antennas, instead of the SuperFilter product.
Superconductor cannot predict whether it



will be successful in selling the SuperFilter to
the Conductus customers, and the failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on future commercial product revenue
growth.

Conductus executive officers and directors
have interests that may influence them to support and approve
the proposed merger.

Some of the directors and executive officers of
Conductus will receive continuing indemnification against
liabilities and have Conductus stock, stock options and
employment agreements that provide them with interests in the
proposed merger that are different from, or are in addition to,
your interests in the merger. In addition, upon the completion
of the merger, if terminated or constructively terminated,
certain officers of Conductus will be entitled to severance
payments. As a result, the Conductus directors and executive
officers may be more likely to vote to adopt and approve the
merger agreement and approve the merger than if they did not
have these interests. See the section entitled The
Merger  Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger  Conductus beginning on page 53.

Uncertainties associated with the merger
may cause Superconductor and Conductus to lose key
personnel.

Current and prospective Superconductor and
Conductus employees may experience uncertainty about their
future roles with Superconductor after the proposed merger.
These employees could include executive officers and other key
employees whose continued employment may be critical to the
success of Superconductor after the merger. This uncertainty may
adversely affect the ability of Superconductor and Conductus to
attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and
technical personnel, including executive officers.

Risks Common to the Businesses of
Superconductor and Conductus

Superconductor and Conductus each have a
history of losses and may never become profitable.

Conductus incurred significant losses since
inception. In 2001, Conductus incurred a net loss of $17,997,000
and used cash totalling $18,730,000 in operating activities.
During the first nine months of 2002, Conductus incurred a net
loss of $13,894,000 and used cash of $11,031,000 in operating
activities. It had an accumulated deficit of $103,807,000 as of
September 30, 2002. Conductus expects that operating losses
and negative cash flows will continue at least through 2002 as
it continues to market its ClearSite product and increase its
customer base. Conductus does not yet know when, if ever,
Conductus will operate on a profitable basis and generate cash
from operations.

Superconductor has experienced significant net
losses and negative cash flows from operations in each of its
last five fiscal years. It had an accumulated deficit of
$101,535,000 as of September 28, 2002. Superconductor
expects to incur net losses for fiscal 2002 and 2003 and must
significantly increase its revenues to achieve and maintain
profitability. If it fails to increase revenues from sales of
its SuperFilter products, it will continue to experience losses
indefinitely.

Conductus audit opinion includes a
paragraph explaining that it may be unable to continue as a
going concern.

Given Conductus revenue and expense
expectations for 2002, Conductus believes that it will need to
raise as much as $8-12 million of additional capital in
order to continue as a going concern into 2003. If the proposed
merger does not occur, Conductus expects to raise additional
capital. However, there can be no assurance that additional
financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
Unless Conductus is able to raise significant additional funds
through new financing, it may be required to obtain funds on
unfavorable terms or to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more
of its research and development programs. If it is unable to
raise significant additional funds and unable ever to generate
cash from operations, it will be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Conductuss financial statements have been
prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.



Superconductor will need to raise
    additional capital in the future.

As of September 28, 2002, Superconductor had
cash and cash equivalents of $8.1 million. Superconductor
believes that this cash balance should be sufficient to fund
operations into the first half of 2003, however, there can be no
assurance that changes in Superconductors plans or other
events will not result in the expenditure of its resources
before then. If the merger transaction is delayed significantly
or is not completed at all, Superconductor will need to raise
additional capital. Superconductor cannot assure you that
capital will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
Superconductors inability to obtain any needed additional
financing could have a material adverse effect on its business
and operating results.

Superconductor may also require additional
capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or
products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies.
If Superconductor cannot raise any needed funds on acceptable
terms, it will harm its business. If Superconductor issues
additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership
percentage of existing stockholders would be reduced. New
investors may also demand rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of common stock.

The future operating results of
Superconductor and Conductus are unpredictable and likely to
fluctuate significantly.

Both Superconductor and Conductus focus their
efforts on developing superconductive products for the wireless
telecommunications industry. Their operating history in that
market is limited and their operating results may be subject to
significant fluctuations. Thus, future operating results cannot
be reliably predicted, making it difficult to assess the value
of either the Superconductor common stock or the Conductus
common stock. Both Superconductor and Conductus believe that
period-to-period comparisons of their respective operating
results are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely
upon period-to-period comparisons as indications of future
performance.

Future operating results of Superconductor and
Conductus may vary significantly due to factors including:

 

Their products have not yet achieved market
    acceptance, making future demand uncertain;

 

The size and timing of significant orders, and
    their fulfillment;

 

The size and timing of government funded
    contracts;

 

Their products may have a long development cycle,
    which may affect their ability to change their product offering
    quickly and compete effectively;

 

Limited life cycle of their products due to
    factors outside of their control, such as changing needs of
    service providers and the emergence of competing products;

 

Changes in their pricing policies, or those of
    their competitors;

 

Changes in their operating expenses and their
    ability to control costs;

 

Their customers budget cycles;

 

Product quality problems;

 

Their ability to obtain sufficient supplies of
    limited or sole-source components for their products;

 

Consolidation by competitors and indirect channel
    partners;

 

Regulatory changes affecting the wireless
    telecommunications industry or their products;

 

Their gain or loss of significant customers;

 

Their ability to increase sales to existing
    customers;

 

Delays in customer orders;

 

Their ability to reduce manufacturing costs;



 

Their ability to manufacture at acceptable
    quality levels;

 

Their ability to introduce new filter products or
    enhancements to their existing filter products;

 

Commercial market acceptance of new products
    introduced by them or their competitors;

 

Introduction of or enhancement of competitive or
    substitute products by their competitors; and

 

Limitations in their existing and future
    manufacturing capacity.

Another factor making their future operating
results difficult to predict is that they currently have a
limited backlog of unshipped orders. Accordingly, future
quarterly revenue is difficult to predict since it depends
substantially upon orders that are yet to be booked. Product
revenue is also difficult to predict because their sales cycle
(which may increase in the future), varies substantially from
customer to customer and by distribution channel.

The expense levels and expansion plans of
Superconductor and Conductus, including plans to increase
research and development efforts, manufacturing capacity and
sales and marketing, are based in large part on expectations of
future revenue. These items of expense are relatively fixed in
the short-term. Consequently, operating results in any given
period are likely to be disproportionately harmed if revenue in
that period falls below expectations.

Superconductor and Conductus cannot predict
whether their products will be commercially accepted, because
commercial application of superconductive electronics technology
has been limited to date.

Although a number of commercial superconductive
electronic products have been introduced by Superconductor and
Conductus to date, a significant portion of their aggregate
revenue to date has been derived from government research and
development contracts. New products or product enhancements may
or may not be successfully developed, introduced and marketed.
Any new products or product enhancements that are marketed may
not be well received in the marketplace or achieve any
significant degree of commercial acceptance.

The ability of Superconductor and Conductus
to protect their patents and other proprietary rights is
uncertain, exposing them to possible losses of competitive
advantage.

The efforts of Superconductor and Conductus to
protect their proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing
their infringement by others or ensure that these rights will
provide them with a competitive advantage. Pending patent
applications may not result in issued patents and the validity
of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may
also be able to design around the patented aspects of the
products. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent
applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any
owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under
jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by
Superconductor or Conductus jointly with others are not subject
to their exclusive control. Any of these possible events could
result in losses of competitive advantage.

Intellectual property infringement claims
against Superconductor or Conductus could materially harm
results of operations.

The products of Superconductor and Conductus
incorporate a number of technologies, including high temperature
superconductor technology, technology related to other
materials, and electronics technologies. Their patent positions,
and that of other companies using high-temperature
superconductor technology, is uncertain and there is significant
risk that others, including their competitors or potential
competitors, have obtained or will obtain patents relating to
their products or technologies or products or technologies
planned to be introduced by one of them.

Superconductor and Conductus believe that patents
may be or have been issued or applications may be pending
claiming various compositions or features which Superconductor
or Conductus would need a license to utilize in their products.
You cannot be assured that such licenses could be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Superconductor or
Conductus, or both of them, may be required to expend



significant resources to develop alternatives
that would not infringe such patents or to obtain licenses to
the related technology. They may not be able to successfully
design around these patents or obtain licenses to them and may
have to defend themselves at substantial cost against
allegations of infringement of third party patents or other
rights to intellectual property.

On July 17, 2001, ISCO International, Inc.
(ISCO) filed a complaint in the United District
Court for the District of Delaware against Superconductor and
Conductus, alleging that the current base station front-end
systems of both companies containing cryogenically cooled
superconducting filters infringe ISCOs U.S. Patent
No. 6,263,215, entitled Cryoelectronically Cooled
Receiver Front End for Mobile Radio Systems, which was
issued on July 17, 2001. On September 17, 2001, ISCO
amended its complaint to allege willful infringement and to seek
treble damages for the alleged infringement. The complaint seeks
injunctive relief and damages for infringement. Superconductor
and Conductus have both denied infringement, denied that the
patent is valid and alleged that the patent was procured through
inequitable conduct. Both Superconductor and Conductus have
filed counterclaims seeking declarations of invalidity and
non-infringement and damages for unfair competition. Both
Superconductor and Conductus believe that ISCOs claims are
without merit and they are defending themselves vigorously.
While the outcome of this claim cannot be predicted with
certainty, they do not believe that the outcome will have a
material adverse effect on their financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. The parties completed fact discovery
on June 28, 2002, and filed dispositive motions in July.
The judge held a Markman hearing on October 15,
2002. At the Markman hearing, the judge received evidence
concerning the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted
by ISCO. The judge issued his rulings regarding the hearing on
October 30, 2002. The parties expect to complete expert
discovery by December 23, 2002. The trial is scheduled to
start March 17, 2003.

An adverse outcome in the pending litigation, or
in litigation of other intellectual property claims could
subject Superconductor or Conductus, or both of them, to
significant liabilities or require them to cease using key
technology. In any case, the cost of defending an intellectual
property lawsuit could constitute a major financial burden.

Both Superconductor and Conductus depend
upon technology licensed from others which may be subject to
challenge by third parties.

Both Superconductor and Conductus utilize
technologies under licenses of patents from others. These
patents may be subject to challenge, which may result in
significant litigation expense (which may or may not be
recoverable against future royalty obligations).

Because competition for target employees is
intense, Superconductor or Conductus may be subject to claims of
unfair hiring practices, trade secrets misappropriation or other
related claims.

Companies in the wireless telecommunications
industry whose employees accept positions with competitors
frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair
hiring practices, trade secrets misappropriation or other
related claims. Superconductor or Conductus may be subject to
such claims in the future as they seek to hire qualified
personnel, and such claims may result in material litigation.
Substantial costs could be incurred in defending against these
claims, regardless of their merits.

Superconductor and Conductus depend on
specific patents and licenses to technologies, and they will
likely need additional technologies in the future that they may
not be able to utilize.

Both Superconductor and Conductus are continually
trying to develop new products. In the course of doing so, they
may be required to utilize intellectual property rights owned by
others and may seek licenses to do so. Such licenses may not be
obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. It is
also possible that Superconductor or Conductus may inadvertently
utilize intellectual property rights held by others, which could
result in substantial claims.



Other parties may have the right to utilize
technology important to the business of Superconductor and
Conductus.

Both Superconductor and Conductus utilize certain
intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or
have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual
property rights licensed from a third party. Because
Superconductor and Conductus may not have the exclusive rights
to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able
to enter into competition with Superconductor or Conductus,
which may harm their business.

Superconductor and Conductus have focused
on one material for their product development efforts, which may
not prove competitive against other materials.

To date, Superconductor has principally focused
its development efforts on thallium barium calcium copper oxide,
and Conductus has principally focused its development efforts on
yttrium barium copper oxide. Other materials are currently known
to have advantages over thallium barium calcium copper oxide and
yttrium barium copper oxide for some applications. Neither of
these materials may ultimately prove commercially competitive
against other currently known materials. Furthermore, other
materials may be discovered with higher critical temperatures or
other superior qualities, and neither Superconductor nor
Conductus may be able to obtain the rights to those superior
materials.

The failure of Superconductor and Conductus
to anticipate and respond to developments in the wireless
telecommunications market could substantially harm their
business.

The efforts of Superconductor and Conductus are
focused on the wireless telecommunications market, including the
2G, 2.5G and 3G markets. The concentration of their resources on
the wireless telecommunications market makes them potentially
vulnerable to changes in this market, such as new technologies,
future competition, changes in availability of capital resources
or regulatory changes that could affect the competitive position
and rate of growth of the wireless industry.

Superconductor and Conductus may not be
able to compete effectively in the superconductive electronics
industry or against alternative technologies.

The products of Superconductor and Conductus
compete with a number of alternative approaches and technologies
that increase the capacity and improve the quality of wireless
networks. Some of these alternatives may be more cost effective
or offer better performance than the products of Superconductor
or Conductus. Wireless network operators may opt to increase the
number of transmission stations, increase tower heights, install
filters and amplifiers at the top of antennas or use advanced
antenna technology in lieu of purchasing products offered by
Superconductor or Conductus. Superconductor and Conductus may
not succeed in competing with these alternatives.

The market for superconductive electronics
currently is small and in the early stages of commercialization.
As superconductive electronics emerge as a viable alternative to
current solutions, the market will become intensively
competitive. A number of large companies with substantially
greater financial resources and capabilities are engaged in
programs to develop and commercialize products that may compete
with those offered by Superconductor and Conductus, or promote
alternative solutions to meet the needs of the wireless network
operators. For example, Dupont exhibited a tower top HTS
front-end unit at a trade show in March 2002. Small companies,
including ISCO International and CryoDevices, Inc., are also
developing and commercializing superconductive electronic
products for the telecommunications industry. Furthermore,
academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public
and private research organizations are engaged in development
programs that may lead to commercial superconductive electronic
products. The success of Superconductor and Conductus will
depend on their ability to develop and maintain their
technological leadership while managing the various risks
described in this document.



Changes in the mix of sales channels used
by Superconductor and Conductus could cause fluctuations in
future operating results.

Superconductor and Conductus currently sell most
of their products directly to wireless network operators in the
United States. They plan, however, to expand their business in
international markets by increasing their direct sales force and
selling through resellers or directly through original equipment
manufacturers. If changes in the mix of their sales channels
occur, their gross profit and operating margins may fluctuate
significantly.

Superconductor and Conductus depend upon
government contracts for a substantial portion of revenue, and
their business may suffer if significant contracts are
terminated or adversely modified or they are unable to win new
contracts.

Both Superconductor and Conductus derive a
portion of their revenue from contracts with the
U.S. government. Their government contracts include both
research and development contracts and government product sales.
Revenue from government contracts is derived primarily from a
few large contracts. As a result, a reduction in, or
discontinuance of, the governments commitment to current
or future programs could materially reduce government contract
revenue. Furthermore, Conductuss license agreement with
one company, GDES, prevents them from competing with GDES for
certain hardware research and development government contracts.
If future government research and development projects were
limited to areas in which GDES may prevent Conductus from
competing, their financial condition could be significantly
harmed.

Contracts involving the U.S. government may
include various risks, including:

 

Termination by the government;

 

Reduction or modification in the event of changes
    in the governments requirements or budgetary constraints;

 

Increased or unexpected costs causing losses or
    reduced profits under contracts where prices are fixed or
    unallowable costs under contracts where the government
    reimburses for costs and pays an additional premium;

 

Risks of potential disclosure of confidential
    information to third parties;

 

The failure or inability of the main contractor
    to perform its contract in circumstances where Superconductor or
    Conductus is a subcontractor;

 

The failure of the government to exercise options
    for additional work provided for in the contracts; and

 

The governments right in certain
    circumstances to freely use technology developed under these
    contracts.

The programs in which Superconductor and
Conductus participate may extend for several years, but are
normally funded on an annual basis. The U.S. government may
not continue to fund programs under which Superconductor or
Conductus have entered into contracts. Even if funding is
continued, Superconductor or Conductus may fail to compete
successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs.

All costs for services under government contracts
are subject to audit, and the acceptance of such costs as
allowable and allocable is subject to federal regulatory
guidelines. Both Superconductor and Conductus record contract
revenues in amounts which they expect to be realized upon final
audit settlement. Any disallowance of costs by the government
could have an adverse effect on their business, operating
results and financial condition. Neither Superconductor nor
Conductus can assure you that audits and adjustments will not
result in decreased revenues and net income for those years.
Additionally, because of their participation in government
contracts, Superconductor and Conductus are subject to audit
from time to time for their compliance with government
regulations by various agencies. Government agencies may conduct
inquiries or investigations that may cover a broad range of
activity. Responding to any such audits, inquiries or
investigations may involve significant expense and divert
management attention. In addition, an adverse



finding in any such audit, inquiry or
investigation could involve penalties that may harm the business
of Superconductor or Conductus.

The future success of Superconductor and
Conductus depends on their ability to focus primarily on
commercial markets.

Both Superconductor and Conductus believe that
any future growth they may experience will depend on their
ability to develop, market and manufacture products for the
commercial marketplace. Because there are substantial
differences between the requirements for a government
contracting business and a technology products business,
Superconductor and Conductus face a number of challenges in
developing their commercial products business. In particular,
they must implement an effective sales and marketing strategy
and volume manufacturing capability, neither of which is
required to support the government contracting business. If they
are unable to develop their commercial products business, their
business will be harmed.

The business of Superconductor or Conductus
could be significantly damaged by harm to, or the loss of, a
relationship with any one of their small number of
customers.

A relatively small number of customers have
accounted for a significant portion of the total revenue of
Superconductor and Conductus, and they expect that this trend
will continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in the
nine months ended September 28, 2002, 94% of
Superconductors commercial product revenue was derived
from sales to Alltel and U.S. Cellular. During the same period,
Conductus had one primary customer, Dobson Communications
Corporation, for its commercial product revenues. Accordingly,
their future operating results will continue to substantially
depend on the success of these few customers and their
relationships with them. Any reduction or delay in sales of
products to one or more of these key customers could
significantly harm the business of Superconductor or Conductus.
Operating results will also depend on the ability of
Superconductor and Conductus to successfully develop
relationships with additional key customers. Neither
Superconductor nor Conductus can assure you that they will
retain their largest customers or that they will be able to sell
products to additional key customers.

Most customers of Superconductor and Conductus
have the right to cease doing business with them with limited
notice and with little or no penalty. Customer agreements
typically do not require minimum purchases. Customers may also
have relationships with competitors of Superconductor and
Conductus. These relationships may affect the purchasing
decisions of such customers. Neither Superconductor nor
Conductus can assure you that their customers will not choose to
direct their business to competitors of Superconductor and
Conductus.

The wireless communication industry is
highly concentrated, which limits the number of potential
customers.

The wireless communication industry is highly
concentrated in nature and may become more concentrated due to
anticipated industry consolidation. As a result, both
Superconductor and Conductus believe that the number of
potential customers for their products will be limited. For
example, the U.S. wireless operations of three of their
target customers  AirTouch, Bell Atlantic and
GTE  were consolidated in 2000 into one entity called
Verizon. Later in 2000, SBC Communications and BellSouth
combined to form Cingular. If the wireless communication
industry does not adopt the products of Superconductor and
Conductus and they fail to capture a significant percentage of
the commercial wireless market customers, their business will be
harmed.

Superconductor and Conductus currently rely
on specific technologies and may not successfully adjust to the
rapidly changing superconductive electronics
market.

The field of superconductivity is characterized
by rapidly advancing technology. The success of Superconductor
and Conductus depends upon their ability to keep pace with
advancing superconductive technology, including materials,
processes and industry standards. Their development efforts to
date are focused principally on thallium barium calcium copper
oxide, in the case of Superconductor, and yttrium



barium copper oxide, in the case of Conductus.
However, these materials may not ultimately prove commercially
competitive against other currently known materials or materials
that may be discovered in the future.

Superconductor and Conductus will have to
continue to develop and integrate advances in technology for the
fabrication of electronic circuits and devices and manufacture
of commercial quantities of products. They will also need to
continue to develop and integrate advances in complementary
technologies. Neither Superconductor nor Conductus can assure
you that their development efforts will not be rendered obsolete
by research efforts and technological advances made by others or
that materials other than those currently used by us will not
prove more advantageous for the commercialization of
superconductive electronic products.

The sales cycles of Superconductor and
Conductus are unpredictable and may be long, making future
performance unpredictable.

The experience of Superconductor and Conductus
with the sales cycle for telecommunications products is limited.
The sales cycle includes identification of decision makers
within the customers organizations, development of an
understanding of customer-specific performance and economic
issues, convincing the customer through field trial reports of
the benefits of systems offered, negotiation of purchase orders
and deployment.

Because customers who purchase systems from
Superconductor or Conductus must commit a significant amount of
capital and other resources, sales are subject to delays beyond
the control of Superconductor or Conductus. Their customers must
consider budgetary constraints, comply with internal procedures
for approving large expenditures and complete whatever testing
is necessary for them to integrate new technologies that will
affect their key operations. While the sales cycle for an
initial order is typically 6 to 12 months, Superconductor
and Conductus may experience longer sales cycles in the future.
Such delays or lengthened sales cycles could have a material
adverse effect on their business.

Superconductor and Conductus depend on the
capital spending patterns of wireless network operators, and if
capital spending is decreased or delayed, the business of
Superconductor or Conductus may be harmed.

Because Superconductor and Conductus rely on
wireless network operators for product purchases, any
substantial decrease or delay in capital spending patterns in
the wireless communication industry may harm the business of
Superconductor or Conductus. Demand from customers for the
products offered by Superconductor and Conductus depends to a
significant degree upon the magnitude and timing of capital
spending by these customers for constructing, rebuilding or
upgrading their systems. The capital spending patterns of
wireless network operators depend on a variety of factors,
including access to financing, the status of federal, local and
foreign government regulation and deregulation, changing
standards for wireless technology, overall demand for wireless
services, competitive pressures and general economic conditions.
In addition, capital spending patterns in the wireless industry
can be subject to some degree of seasonality, with lower levels
of spending in the third calendar quarter, based on annual
budget cycles.

The dependence of Superconductor and
Conductus on a small number of suppliers makes the companies
particularly vulnerable to events that impact their suppliers,
most of which are beyond their control.

Superconductor and Conductus currently obtain
certain product components from a single source or a limited
number of suppliers. For example, Conductus obtains its
cryocoolers from a single source. The business of Superconductor
or Conductus could be significantly harmed by:

 

An inability to develop alternative sources for
    components to meet customer demand;

 

A prolonged interruption in supply; or

 

A significant increase in price of one or more
    components.



The failure of Superconductor and Conductus
to successfully develop collaborative relationships with
government agencies, research institutions and other companies
could harm their business.

Superconductor and Conductus have established and
continue to seek collaborative arrangements with corporate
partners, government agencies and public and private research
institutions to develop, manufacture and market superconductive
electronic products. Their success depends on the development
and success of these collaborative arrangements. However, they
may not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements on
commercially reasonable terms, and even if established, these
arrangements may not succeed. If these programs are successful,
their collaborative partners may seek to manufacture jointly
developed products themselves or obtain them from alternative
sources, rather than purchase them from Superconductor or
Conductus. Finally, these programs:

 

May require Superconductor or Conductus to share
    control over our development, manufacturing and marketing
    programs and relinquish rights to their technology;

 

May be subject to termination at the discretion
    of the collaborative partners; and

 

May restrict the ability of Superconductor or
    Conductus to engage in certain areas of product development,
    manufacturing and marketing.

The limited commercial manufacturing
experience and capabilities of Superconductor and Conductus
could hamper their success.

The failure of Superconductor and Conductus to
develop adequate manufacturing capabilities would significantly
harm their business. Currently, they have only limited
production facilities. To date, they have focused primarily on
developing fabrication processes and producing limited
quantities of products. Although their processing technology
derives principally from semiconductor manufacturing technology,
the fabrication of high-temperature superconductor components is
especially difficult because of specific properties unique to
high-temperature superconductor materials.

Neither Superconductor nor Conductus can assure
you that they can develop the necessary manufacturing capability
to attain yields sufficient to meet the demand for their
products at a cost that will allow them to provide a price/
performance advantage to customers in comparison with other
alternatives. While they have established limited production
facilities for their products, they may not be able to expand
their processing, production control, assembly, testing and
quality assurance capabilities to produce existing or planned
superconductive electronic products in adequate commercial
quantities.

Even if the products of Superconductor and
Conductus meet performance standards acceptable to the
superconductive electronics market, neither Superconductor nor
Conductus can assure you that any such products will offer
price/ performance advantages in comparison with other
alternatives sufficient to achieve market acceptance, or that
production costs will be low enough to operate profitably.

Superconductor and Conductus anticipate
decreases in average selling prices, requiring them to reduce
costs and introduce new systems in order to achieve and maintain
profitability.

A large order of products of Superconductor was
discounted in December 2001; future orders may also be
discounted. There has been a reduction in average selling prices
of Superconductor products in 2002. The companies will need to
further reduce their manufacturing costs through engineering
improvements and economies of scale in production and purchasing
in order to achieve adequate gross margins. Neither
Superconductor nor Conductus may be able to achieve the required
cost savings at a rate needed to keep pace with competitive
pricing pressure. Failure to reach that objective may harm their
business.

If Superconductor or Conductus is unable to
forecast their inventory needs accurately, they may be unable to
obtain efficient manufacturing capacity or may incur unnecessary
costs and produce excess inventory.

Superconductor and Conductus each use a rolling
forecast based on anticipated product orders to determine
manufacturing requirements. If they overestimate their
requirements, they may have excess



inventory, and their suppliers may as well, which
could increase costs to Superconductor and Conductus. If they
underestimate their requirements, their suppliers may have
inadequate inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing and
result in delays in shipments and recognition of revenues. In
addition, lead times for ordering materials and components vary
significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a
given time. Accordingly, if Superconductor or Conductus
inaccurately forecast demand, they may be unable to obtain
adequate manufacturing capacity from suppliers to meet
customers delivery requirements, which would harm the
business of Superconductor or Conductus.

The success of Superconductor and Conductus
depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and
technical personnel with relevant expertise.

As a competitor in a highly technical market,
Superconductor and Conductus depend heavily upon the efforts of
their existing senior management and technical teams. The loss
of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow
product development and commercialization objectives. Due to the
specialized nature of high-temperature superconductors,
Superconductor and Conductus also depend upon their ability to
attract and retain qualified technical personnel with
substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for
qualified personnel is intense and neither Superconductor nor
Conductus may be able to continue to attract and retain
qualified personnel necessary for the development of their
business.

Regulatory changes negatively affecting
wireless communications companies could substantially harm the
business of Superconductor and Conductus.

The Federal Communications Commission strictly
regulates the operation of wireless base stations in the United
States. Other countries also regulate the operation of base
stations within their territories. Base stations and equipment
marketed for use in base stations must meet specific technical
standards. The ability of Superconductor and Conductus to sell
their high-temperature superconductor filter subsystems will
depend upon the rate of deployment of other new wireless digital
services, the ability of base station equipment manufacturers
and of base station operators to obtain and retain the necessary
approvals and licenses, and changes in regulations that may
impact the product requirements. Any failure or delay of base
station manufacturers or operators in obtaining necessary
approvals could harm the business of Superconductor and
Conductus.

Superconductor and Conductus derive a
portion of their revenue from sales outside the United States,
and their international business activities subject them to
risks that could reduce the demand for their products and
increase their operating expense.

A significant part of the strategy of
Superconductor and Conductus involves the continued pursuit of
growth opportunities in a number of international markets,
including Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Superconductor and Conductus
also anticipate expanding their efforts into Europe and Latin
America. In many international markets, barriers to entry are
the result of long-standing relationships between potential
customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations,
including local content and service requirements. In addition,
pursuit of international growth opportunities may require
significant investments for an extended period before any
returns are realized by Superconductor or Conductus from their
investment.

The business of Superconductor and Conductus in
international markets could be adversely affected by:

 

Different technology standards and design
    requirements;

 

Difficulty in attracting qualified personnel;

 

Longer payment cycles for and greater
    difficulties collecting accounts receivable;

 

Export controls, tariffs and other barriers;

 

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

 

Nationalization, expropriation and limitations on
    repatriation of cash;



 

Social, economic, banking and political risks;

 

Taxation;

 

Changes in U.S. laws and policies affecting
    trade, foreign investment and loans; and

 

Cultural differences in the conduct of business.

Superconductor and Conductus may acquire or
make investments in companies or technologies that could cause
loss of value to stockholders and disruption of
business.

Superconductor and Conductus intend to explore
opportunities to acquire companies or technologies in the
future. Entering into an acquisition entails many risks, any of
which could adversely affect the business of Superconductor or
Conductus, including:

 

Failure to integrate the acquired assets and/or
    companies with current business;

 

The price paid may exceed the value eventually
    realized;

 

Loss of share value to existing stockholders as a
    result of issuing equity securities as part or the entire
    purchase price;

 

Potential loss of key employees from either the
    then current business of Superconductor or Conductus or the
    acquired business;

 

Entering into markets in which Superconductor or
    Conductus has little or no prior experience;

 

Diversion of financial resources and
    managements attention from other business concerns;

 

Assumption of unanticipated liabilities related
    to the acquired assets; and

 

The business or technologies acquired or invested
    in may have limited operating histories and may be subjected to
    many of the same risks to which Superconductor and Conductus are
    exposed.

If any companies or technologies are
acquired by Superconductor or Conductus in the future, they
could prove difficult to integrate, could disrupt business,
dilute stockholder value or adversely affect their operating
results.

Superconductor or Conductus may acquire or make
investments in complementary companies, services and
technologies in the future. No such acquisitions or investments
have been made to date and, therefore, the ability of
Superconductor or Conductus as an organization to make
acquisitions or investments is unproven.

Acquisitions and investments involve numerous
risks, including:

 

difficulties in integrating operations,
    technologies, services and personnel;

 

diversion of financial and management resources
    from existing operations;

 

risk of entering new markets;

 

potential loss of key employees; and

 

inability to generate sufficient revenues to
    offset acquisition or investment costs.

In addition, future acquisitions could result in
potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the
incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization
expenses or charges related to goodwill or other intangible
assets, any of which could harm the business of Superconductor
or Conductus. As a result, if Superconductor or Conductus fails
to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments,
their business and prospects may be seriously harmed.



If Superconductor and Conductus are unable
to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage their
expected growth, they may not be able to successfully offer
their products and implement their business plan.

The ability of Superconductor and Conductus to
successfully offer their products and implement their business
plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning
and management process. Anticipated growth in future operations
will continue to place a significant strain on management
systems and resources. Superconductor and Conductus expect that
they will need to continue to improve their financial and
managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and will
need to continue to expand, train and manage their work force
worldwide. Furthermore, they expect that they will be required
to manage multiple relationships with various customers and
other third parties.

Compliance with environmental regulations
could be especially costly due to the hazardous materials used
in the manufacturing process.

Superconductor and Conductus are subject to a
number of federal, state and local governmental regulations
related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic,
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in their
business. Any failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in fines being imposed, suspension of
production or interruption of operations. In addition, these
regulations could restrict the ability of Superconductor or
Conductus to expand or require them to acquire costly equipment
or incur other significant expense to comply with environmental
regulations or to clean up prior discharges.

Terrorism and the declaration of war by the
United States against terrorism may have adversely affected, and
may in the future adversely affect, the business of
Superconductor or Conductus.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on
September 11, 2001, and the declaration of war by the
United States against terrorism has created significant
instability and uncertainty in the world, which may have had,
and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on world
financial markets, including financial markets in the United
States. In addition, such adverse political events may have had,
and may in the future have, an adverse impact on economic
conditions in the United States. Unfavorable economic conditions
in the United States may have had, and may in the future have,
an adverse affect on Superconductor and Conductus, including,
but not limited to, their ability to expand the market for their
products, obtain financing as needed, enter into strategic
relationships and effectively compete in the information
exchange and knowledge exchange markets.

The reliability of market data included in
Superconductor public filings is uncertain.

Since Superconductor is relatively new to the
commercial market and operates in a rapidly changing market,
Superconductor has in the past, and may from time to time in the
future, include market data from industry publications in some
of the documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The reliability of this data cannot be assured. The
market data and information used to prepare this proxy statement
/prospectus was obtained from internal company surveys and
industry publications. Industry publications generally state
that the information contained in these publications has been
obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that its
accuracy and completeness is not guaranteed. Although
Superconductor believes that the market data used is and will be
reliable, it has not been independently verified. Similarly,
internal company surveys, while believed by Superconductor to be
reliable, have not been verified by any independent sources.



Risks Related to Superconductor Common
Stock

Superconductors common stock may
continue to be volatile and we may be exposed to costly
securities class action lawsuits.

The market price of Superconductor common stock
has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Our
common stock may be significantly affected by the following
factors:

 

Actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating
    results;

 

Announcements of technological innovations;

 

Announcements of new products or new contracts by
    Superconductor or its competitors;

 

Conditions and trends in the telecommunications
    and other technology industries; and

 

Changes in estimates of Superconductors
    future financial results or recommendations by securities
    analysts.

In addition, the stock market has from time to
time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that
have particularly affected the market prices for the securities
of technology companies. In the past, securities class action
lawsuits have often been brought against such companies
following periods of stock price volatility. Superconductor may
be affected by similar litigation in the future, which could
result in substantial costs and cause a diversion of
managements attention and resources. These events could
significantly harm the business, operating results or financial
condition of Superconductor.

Your ability to sell shares of
Superconductor common stock may depend upon Superconductor
maintaining its Nasdaq listing.

Superconductors common stock is listed on
the Nasdaq National Market. Superconductor cannot assure you
that it will always be listed. The Nasdaq National Market has
rules for maintaining a listing, including (currently) a minimum
stock price of $1 per share. Superconductor may not meet all of
these requirements in the future, particularly if the price of
Superconductors common stock declines. If
Superconductors common stock is not listed with Nasdaq, it
may be difficult or impossible to sell it.

The market price of Superconductor common
stock may be adversely affected by the sale of significant
numbers of shares of Superconductor common stock by major
holders, including those purchasing shares of Superconductor
common stock and warrants to purchase Superconductor common
stock in the private placement.

Sales of a substantial number of
Superconductors common shares in the public market could
cause the market price of its common stock to decline.
Superconductor had 25,198,270 shares of common stock
outstanding at October 22, 2002, plus another
6,124,622 shares of common stock covered by then
outstanding options and warrants, including 585,560 shares
covered by unvested warrants. All of the shares issuable upon
option exercises and 1,863,983 of the shares issuable upon
warrant exercises are freely tradable. The shares issuable upon
exercise of the balance of the warrants will be restricted
securities, but have certain registration rights. Upon
completion of the private placement financing concurrently with
the proposed merger, Superconductor will have
59,806,845 shares of common stock outstanding, and
15,531,089 shares of common stock covered by outstanding
options and warrants. The shares and warrants issued in
connection with the private placement will not be registered
when sold and therefore may not be sold immediately in a public
transaction. However, Superconductor will be required to
register all such shares promptly after closing, upon which such
shares may be sold in public transactions.

In addition, after closing of the proposed
merger, Superconductor will have five stockholders each of which
will own more than 5% of Superconductors common stock.

If Superconductors common stockholders sell
substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the
market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of
Superconductors common stock could fall or fail to rise.



The market for purchases and shares of
Superconductor common stock may be very limited. The sale of a
limited number of shares of Superconductor could cause the price
to fall sharply.

The price of Superconductors stock has been
volatile and had a historical book value of $0.90 per share at
September 28, 2002. A variety of brokerage house policies
and practices tend to discourage individual brokers within those
firms from dealing in low-priced stocks. Some of those policies
and practices pertain to the payment of brokers
commissions and to time-consuming procedures that function to
make the handling of low-priced stocks unattractive to brokers
from an economic standpoint. In addition, the structure of
trading commissions also tends to have an adverse impact upon
holders of low-priced stock because the brokerage commission on
a sale of low-priced stock generally represents a higher
percentage of the sales price than the commission on a
relatively higher-priced issue.

As a result, although there presently exists a
market for Superconductors stock, the stock is thinly
traded and the price per share will likely decline substantially
if a large number of shares of Superconductor stock are offered
for sale at or around the same time. Unless demand for, and the
market price of, Superconductor stock significantly increases,
your ability to sell Superconductor stock at a favorable price,
if at all, may be severely limited and your investment may
become illiquid. After the merger and the concurrent private
placement financing, the number of shares of Superconductor
stock outstanding will be significantly increased. If one or
more holders of a substantial number of shares seek to sell
their shares in the public market within a relatively short time
period, the market price of Superconductors stock would
likely decline as a result.

Superconductors corporate governance
structure may prevent their acquisition by another company at a
premium over the public trading price of Superconductor
shares.

It is possible that the acquisition of a majority
of Superconductors outstanding voting stock by another
company could result in Superconductors stockholders
receiving a premium over the public trading price for their
shares. Provisions of the Superconductor restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware corporate law could
delay or make more difficult an acquisition of our company by
merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if it would create
an immediate benefit to our stockholders. For example,
Superconductors restated certificate of incorporation does
not permit stockholders to act by written consent and its bylaws
require advance notice of any matters to be brought before the
stockholders at the annual meeting.

In addition, Superconductors board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and
preferences of this preferred stock, including voting rights of
those shares, without any further vote or action by the
stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be
subordinate to, and adversely affected by, the rights of holders
of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The
issuance of preferred stock could also make it more difficult
for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding
voting stock, even at a premium over our public trading price.

Further, Superconductors certificate of
incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors
with directors divided into three classes serving staggered
terms. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change in control of Superconductor without action
by Superconductors stockholders and, therefore, could
adversely affect the price of Superconductors stock or the
possibility of sale of shares to an acquiring person.

Superconductors stock price is
extremely volatile.

The trading price of Superconductors common
stock has fluctuated significantly in recent periods, and it is
likely that it will continue to be volatile. It is possible that
the price of the common stock will decline below current prices,
and that you would lose all or part of your investment. Equity
markets, particularly for technology companies, have recently
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are
unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of
Superconductors common stock to decline.



Superconductors and Conductus
net operating loss carryforwards could be reduced if there is a
change of ownership under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

At December 31, 2001, Superconductor had
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$85.6 million and Conductus had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $72.1 million. Under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, if the percentage of stock (by value) of a loss
corporation that is owned by one or more 5-percent shareholders
has increased by more than 50-percentage points over the lowest
percentage of stock owned by the same shareholders during a
three year testing period (an ownership change), the use of
pre-ownership change net operating losses of the loss
corporation following such ownership change will be limited
based on the value of the loss corporation immediately before
the ownership change (a Section 382 Limitation). Generally,
the annual Section 382 Limitation that applies is
determined by multiplying the value of the loss
corporations stock by a rate published monthly by the
Internal Revenue Service. If a corporation cannot use its entire
Section 382 Limitation in a given taxable year (
e.g.,

because it has insufficient taxable income), the unused
portion is carried forward and added to the Section 382
Limitation that applies for the following year.

Superconductor had an ownership change for
purposes of Section 382 in 1999. This event limits the
ability of Superconductor to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards incurred through the date of the ownership change
(totaling $32.6 million) to an annual Section 382
Limitation of $2.3 million. Net operating losses incurred
subsequent to the ownership change totaled $53.0 million
and are not presently subject to any limitation under
Section 382. However, it is likely that the consummation of
the merger and contemporaneous offering will cause
Superconductor to have another ownership change for purposes of
Section 382 that further restricts the future utilization of
Superconductors net operating loss carryforwards incurred
through the ownership change date. If such an ownership change
occurs, the applicable Section 382 Limitation will be
significantly lower than the $2.3 million limitation that
resulted from the 1999 ownership change.

In addition, it is likely that the consummation
of the merger will cause Conductus to have an ownership change
for purposes of Section 382 that severely limits the future
utilization of Conductus net operating loss carryforwards
incurred through the ownership change date.



THE MERGER

This section describes the merger, the merger
agreement and the other agreements entered into by
Superconductor, Conductus and their officers and directors in
connection with the merger. While Superconductor and Conductus
believe that the description covers the material terms of the
merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that
is important to you. You should carefully read this entire
document and the other documents referred to in this proxy
statement/ prospectus, such as the merger agreement, for a more
complete understanding of the merger.

Background of the Merger

The respective management groups of Conductus and
Superconductor review, on a regular basis, the strategic focus
of their companies in light of the rapidly changing competitive
environment of the wireless infrastructure industry. An
objective of these strategic reviews is to identify
opportunities to enhance stockholder value. Senior management of

Superconductors Reasons for the
Merger

At a special telephonic meeting held on
October 8, 2002, the board of directors of Superconductor
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the issuance of
Superconductor stock in the merger. Superconductors board
of directors concluded that the proposed merger and related
transactions were fair to and in the best interests of
Superconductor and its stockholders. In reaching its decision,
the board of directors consulted with S&P CVC and with
Superconductors senior management. The Superconductor
board took into consideration a number of factors, including the
following:

 

The acquisition of Conductus by Superconductor
    presents numerous opportunities to streamline the combined
    businesses and integrate the capabilities of the two companies;

 

The combined company presents a more attractive
    investment opportunity and would likely be able to raise needed
    capital on more favorable terms than either company could
    individually;

 

Superconductor and Conductus represent
    30 years of collective experience in superconductor
    technology and together expect to accelerate the wide scale
    deployment of the technology in the telecommunications industry;

 

With combined revenues expected to be between
    $27 and $30 million by fiscal year 2002, the combined
    company is expected to reach critical mass sooner than either
    company could have achieved on its own;

 

Management believes that the potential exists to
    merge complementary technologies to develop better and lower
    cost products through improved cryogenic cooling, filter design
    and wafer fabrication technologies;

 

The government business of Conductus complements
    the commercial products business of Superconductor;

 

Superconductor anticipates significant cost
    savings through synergies in a number of areas, including sales
    and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, and
    general and administrative activities, through the elimination
    of redundancies and efficiencies realized through the new
    infrastructure;

 

Additional synergies are anticipated from plant
    rationalization in servicing the commercial and government
    customers;

 

Management expects to accelerate profitability as
    a result of the transaction;

 

The combined company should be a stronger force
    within the wireless sub-system equipment market, and should be
    well positioned to benefit from the deployment of new cell
    sites; and

 

The opinion of S&P CVC that, based on
    information available through September 26, 2002, and
    subject to certain matters stated therein, the consideration to
    be paid by Superconductor in the merger was fair to
    Superconductor and its stockholders from a financial point of
    view.



The Superconductor board also identified and
considered a variety of potential risks and potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including,
but not limited to:

 

The risk that the potential benefits and desired
    synergies sought in the merger might not be fully realized;

 

The possibility that the merger might not be
    consummated;

 

The possibility that integration may cost more
    and take longer than anticipated and not be effective;

 

The potential dilutive effect of the issuance of
    Superconductor stock in the merger;

 

The substantial charges to expense to be
    incurred, primarily in the quarter ending December 31,
    2002, in connection with the merger, including costs of
    integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from
    the merger; and

 

Various other risks.

The Superconductor board believed that these
risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

In view of the wide variety of the material
factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the
merger and the complexity of these matters, the Superconductor
board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative weight to
the various factors considered. In addition, the Superconductor
board of directors did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect
of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the
ultimate determination of the Superconductor board of directors,
but rather the Superconductor board of directors conducted an
overall analysis of the factors described above, including
discussions with and questioning of Superconductors senior
management and legal and financial advisors.

Recommendation of the Superconductor Board of
Directors

For the reasons discussed above,
Superconductors board of directors unanimously approved
the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the
merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of
Superconductor and its stockholders and recommends to its
stockholders that they vote 
FOR
 approval of
the merger proposal.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to
Superconductor

Superconductor retained Standard &
Poors Corporate Value Consulting, referred to as S&P
CVC, to furnish financial advisory services with respect to the
proposed merger and to render an opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to Superconductor and its
stockholders of the consideration to be paid by Superconductor
in the merger. The exchange ratio and the amount and form of
consideration to be paid in the merger was determined through
arms length negotiations between Superconductor and
Conductus and not by S&P CVC, although S&P CVC
assisted Superconductor in these negotiations.

On October 8, 2002, S&P CVC presented
its findings to the Superconductor board of directors. On
October 9, 2002, S&P CVC delivered its written opinion
that, subject to the assumptions, factors and other limitations
described in the written opinion, concludes the consideration to
be paid by Superconductor in the merger is fair to
Superconductor and its stockholders from a financial point of
view. S&P CVCs opinion is addressed to the
Superconductor board, is directed only to the financial terms of
the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to
any Superconductor stockholder as to how that stockholder should
vote on, or take any other action relating to, the merger.

A copy of S&P CVCs opinion, which
sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered, limitations
on and scope of the review undertaken by S&P CVC is filed as
an exhibit to the registration statement to which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. A copy of S&P CVCs
opinion is available for your review or copying at
Superconductors principal executive offices during regular
business hours.



The summary of S&P CVCs opinion
set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to S&P CVCs opinion. You
should read S&P CVCs opinion carefully and in its
entirety for a description of the procedures followed, the
factors considered, and the assumptions made by S&P CVC.

In arriving at its opinion,
S&P CVCs procedures included, but were not
limited to, the following:

 

Interviews and meetings with both
    Superconductors and Conductus management concerning
    the history, nature and future operations of both companies;

 

An analysis of Superconductors and
    Conductus historical operations and financial results;

 

An analysis of Superconductors and
    Conductus financial and operating projections prepared by
    the management of Superconductor and Conductus;

 

A review of the historical stock prices and
    trading volumes of Superconductor stock and Conductus stock;

 

A review of the conditions in and outlook for the
    wireless industry;

 

An analysis of publicly available financial and
    market data for publicly traded companies engaged in lines of
    business similar to that of Superconductor and Conductus;

 

An analysis, to the extent publicly available, of
    the financial terms of recent acquisitions deemed comparable to
    the proposed merger;

 

A review and analysis of documents related to the
    merger including: the draft Agreement and Plan of Merger,
    Preferred Stock Agreements, which were entered into with certain
    Superconductor investors and are no longer in effect, and public
    filings with the SEC for both companies;

 

An analysis of the warrants issued and
    outstanding for both companies to derive the implied equity
    value;

 

An analysis of other relevant facts and data as
    S&P CVC deemed appropriate.

S&P CVC assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information reviewed by or discussed with it for purposes of
rendering its opinion. S&P CVC assumed that the
financial forecasts relating to Superconductor and Conductus and
information relating to the prospects of the combined company
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the respective management
of Superconductor and Conductus, at the time of preparation, of
the future operating and financial performance of
Superconductor, Conductus and the combined company.
S&P CVC also assumed, based on discussions with
Superconductors and Conductus management, that the
publicly available financial forecasts relating to
Superconductor and Conductus represent reasonable estimates as
to the future financial performance of Superconductor and
Conductus. S&P CVC relied on estimates prepared by the
management of Superconductor and Conductus of the potential cost
savings and other synergies that may be achieved as a result of
the merger. S&P CVC did not assume any responsibility for or
make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical
inspection of, the assets or liabilities of Superconductor or
Conductus.

S&P CVCs opinion states that it
was based on economic, monetary and market conditions existing
as of the date it was issued. S&P CVC expressed no
opinion as to what the value of Superconductor stock will be
when issued to Conductus stockholders pursuant to the merger or
the prices at which Superconductor stock will actually trade at
any time. In addition, S&P CVC was not asked to
consider, and S&P CVCs opinion does not address,
Superconductors underlying business decision to engage in
the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to
other business strategies that might exist for Superconductor,
or the mergers effect on any other transaction in which
Superconductor might engage.

In preparing its opinion, S&P CVC
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The
following paragraphs summarize the material financial analyses
performed by S&P CVC in arriving at its opinion. Some
of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The



tables are not intended to stand alone, and in
order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by
S&P CVC, the tables must be read together with the full
text of each summary.

Comparable
Company Analysis

Conductus:

S&P CVC analyzed the publicly available financial
information and valuation ratios of six publicly traded
companies that it deemed comparable to Conductus. This grouping
of comparable companies was comprised of Allen Telecom, Inc.,
Anaren Microwave, Inc., California Amplifier, Inc.,
EMS Technologies, Inc., Powerwave Technologies, Inc., and
REMEC, Inc., as well as Superconductor and Conductus themselves.
The valuation multiples that S&P CVC derived using
these comparable companies were based on closing stock prices
and estimated number of fully diluted shares as of
September 26, 2002. These multiples were applied to the
relevant operating parameters of Conductus. All projected
financial data is based on publicly available Wall Street
research analyst estimates. The financial results for Conductus,
for calendar year 2002, were based on internally generated
estimates by Conductus management. This analysis implied
per share values for Conductus stock ranging from a low of
$0.30 to a high of $0.32.

Superconductor:

S&P CVC analyzed the publicly available financial
information and valuation ratios of six publicly traded
companies that were deemed comparable to Superconductor. This
grouping of comparable companies was comprised of Allen Telecom,
Inc., Anaren Microwave, Inc., California Amplifier, Inc.,
EMS Technologies, Inc., Powerwave Technologies, Inc., and
REMEC, Inc., as well as Conductus and Superconductor themselves.
The valuation multiples that S&P CVC derived using
these comparable companies were based on closing stock prices
and estimated number of fully diluted shares as of
September 26, 2002. These multiples were applied to the
relevant operating parameters of Superconductor. All projected
financial data is based on publicly available Wall Street
research analyst estimates. The financial results for
Superconductor for calendar year 2002 were based on internally
generated estimates by Superconductors management. This
analysis implied per share values for Superconductors
stock ranging from a low of $0.53 to a high of $0.68.

Relative Values:

S&P CVC compared the implied per share equity values of
Conductus against Superconductor, based on variations of the
methodology described above, and arrived at implied exchange
ratios that range from a low of 0.46x to a high of 0.59x on a
minority interest basis.

Sensitivities under this approach were performed
using varying estimates of cash balances for each company and
the contribution of those cash balances to the market value
assessment for each company. The conclusions of this analysis
were supportive of the range developed above.

Comparable Acquisition
    Analysis

Methodology:

S&P CVC reviewed transactions that involved comparable
companies by searching news stories, press releases, industry
reports, SEC filings, and databases. The following criteria were
applied in order to screen these transactions for relevance:

 

Transactions announced between the period of
    August 2001 and August 2002;

 

Transactions where sufficient financial
    information was available to arrive at relevant ratios was
    disclosed; and

 

Transactions where the target company operated in
    the wireless sub-system equipment market.



Based on this methodology, the following
transactions were considered:

Target Company

Acquiring Company

Spectrian*

REMEC

Conductus:

S&P CVC analyzed the selected transactions to arrive at
multiples that could be applied to Conductus financial
results. This analysis implied per share values for
Conductus stock ranging from $0.42 to $0.56.

Superconductor:

S&P CVC analyzed the selected transactions to arrive at
multiples that could be applied to Superconductors
financial results. This analysis implied per share values for
Superconductors stock ranging from $0.67 to $1.40.

Relative Values:

S&P CVC compared the implied per share equity values of
Conductus against Superconductor, based on variation of the
methodology described above, and arrived at implied exchange
ratios that range from a low of 0.40x to a high of 0.62x on a
controlling interest basis.

Share Price and Exchange Ratio
    Analysis

The historical stock prices of both Conductus and
Superconductor were analyzed over 1 week, 15 day,
30 day, 2 month, and 3 month time frames prior to
the conclusion of data collection efforts on September 26,
2002.

Conductus:

S&P CVC analyzed the historical share prices of
Conductus stock. This analysis produced average share
prices for Conductus ranging from $0.61 to $0.83.

Superconductor:

S&P CVC analyzed the historical share prices of
Superconductors stock. This analysis produced average
share prices for Superconductor ranging from $1.08 to $1.49.

Relative Values:

S&P CVC compared the average historical share prices of
Conductus against Superconductor, based on variations of the
methodology described above, and arrived at implied exchange
ratios that range from a low of 0.51x to a high of 0.60x on a
minority interest basis.

Control Premium Analysis

S&P CVC reviewed the implied premiums
payable in the four transactions of our Comparable

No company, transaction or business used in the
Comparable Company Analysis, Comparable
Transaction Analysis, or Control Premium
Analysis as a comparison is identical to Superconductor,
Conductus or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the
results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather,
it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in the financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading
or other values of the selected companies or selected
transactions or the business segment, company or transaction to
which they are being compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

In performing its analysis, S&P CVC also
considered a discount cash flow analysis based on projections
through the end of 2003. Both companies projected negative cash
flows over this projection period, and, therefore, value
indications under the discounted cash flow methodology were
driven primarily by exit multiples of forecasted revenue derived
from the market based methodologies set forth above. As a
result, the discounted cash flow analysis was of limited value
in evaluating the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the merger consideration to be offered by Superconductor in the
merger and greater emphasis was placed on the market-based
methodologies discussed above.

In reaching its conclusion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and
in its presentation to the board of directors, S&P CVC
did not rely on any single analysis or factor described above,
assign relative weights to the analyses or factors considered by
it, or make any conclusion as to how the results of any given
analysis, taken alone, supported its opinion. The preparation of
a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant quantitative and qualitative
methods of financial analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by S&P CVC in
connection with rendering its opinion. Accordingly,
S&P CVC believes that its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or the
factors it considered, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying its opinion.

In its analyses, S&P CVC made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Superconductor and Conductus. Any
estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable.
Additionally, analyses relating to the values of businesses or
assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject
to substantial uncertainty.

S&P CVCs opinion and its related
analyses were only one of many factors considered by
Superconductors board of directors in its evaluation of
the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of Superconductors board of directors or
management with respect to the exchange ratio, the consideration
to be paid by Superconductor or the merger.



The terms of the engagement of S&P CVC
by Superconductor are set forth in a letter agreement dated as
of August 7, 2002. Under the terms of that letter
agreement, Superconductor paid to S&P CVC a retainer fee of
$75,000 and an additional fee of $50,000 upon delivery of its
opinion. The fee is not contingent upon the outcome of S&P
CVCs analysis or the tenor of its conclusions. S&P CVC
has also been engaged by Superconductor for an additional
$25,000 to provide guidance on the financial reporting
requirements associated with the merger prior to or subsequent
to the closing. Whether or not the merger is consummated,
Superconductor has agreed to pay S&P CVC for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses arising out of services performed by
S&P CVC as a financial advisor to Superconductor and to
indemnify S&P CVC from and against certain liabilities
in connection with its engagement.

Superconductor retained S&P CVC to act
as its financial advisor on the basis of S&P CVCs
reputation as an internationally recognized investment financial
services and valuation firm with substantial expertise in
transactions similar to the merger. Standard & Poors
is the leading provider of valuation and analytical services,
independent financial information and credit ratings to the
worlds financial and business markets.
S&P CVCs division has advised clients on
valuation and corporate finance issues for over thirty years,
earning a reputation as the leading provider of insightful,
independent and objective valuation advice. As part of its
financial advisory business, S&P CVC is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions and valuations for
other corporate purposes.

Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger  Superconductor

Two of Superconductors directors represent
a large institutional stockholder of Superconductor,
The Hillman Company. Concurrently with the merger,
affiliates of The Hillman Company, represented by
Joseph C. Manzinger and H. Vaughan Blaxter, III
on Superconductors board, will participate in
Superconductors private financing in which they will
acquire additional Superconductor stock at a below market price.

Conductus Reasons for the
Merger

After careful consideration, the Conductus board
of directors has unanimously concluded that the merger agreement
is advisable, and that the terms of the merger agreement and the
merger are fair to and in the best interests of Conductus and
its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Conductus
stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve
the merger. This decision was based upon a number of potential
benefits of the merger that the Conductus board of directors
believes will contribute to the success of the combined company
compared to Conductus continuing to operate as an independent
business, including the following:

 

the Conductus boards judgment that the two
    companies have significant complementary strengths and
    complementary products;

 

the combined companys potential to be a
    much stronger force within the wireless sub-system equipment
    market;

 

The combined company presents a more attractive
    investment opportunity and would likely be able to raise needed
    capital on more favorable terms than either company could
    individually;

 

the combined companys potential to leverage
    global presence in sales, support and alliances through
    Superconductors extensive sales force, strong service
    organization and the combined companys developed customer
    bases;

 

the combined companys potential to achieve
    synergies and reduce costs through the integration of the
    operations of the two companies and the elimination of redundant
    manufacturing overhead expenses as well as duplicate sales,
    marketing and administrative functions;

 

the combined companys potential to
    integrate the individual companies complementary technologies to
    potentially expand and enhance the overall product offering to
    existing and prospective customers;

 

the potential that Superconductors larger
    market capitalization, broad suite of base station filter
    products and historical revenue growth will provide Conductus
    with additional resources to grow and



gain market share more rapidly than Conductus can
    grow as an independent company in the rapidly evolving wireless
    telecommunications equipment market, which has been
    characterized by the consolidation of small, independent
    providers with larger, integrated competitors;

 

that based on the prices of Conductus and
    Superconductor stock at the time the merger agreement was
    approved by the Conductus board of directors, the 0.6 exchange
    ratio was a premium over the price of Conductus stock then
    prevailing in the market;

 

the all stock consideration provides an
    opportunity for Conductus stockholders to participate in
    the future growth in value of the combined company as
    stockholders of Superconductor following the merger; and

 

the presence on the combined companys board
    of directors of three members of the Conductus board of
    directors which will enable the former Conductus directors to
    continue to participate in the deliberations and decisions of
    the combined company.

In identifying these benefits and evaluating the
merger, the Conductus board of directors reviewed a number of
factors and sources of information, including the following:

 

historical information concerning Conductus and
    Superconductor and their respective businesses, financial
    performance, condition, operations, technology, management and
    position in their respective industries, and information and
    evaluations regarding the two companies strengths,
    weaknesses and prospects, both before and after giving effect to
    the merger;

 

the potential effect on stockholder value of
    Conductus continuing as an independent entity, compared to the
    potential effect of a combination with Superconductor in light
    of the financial condition and prospects of Conductus and the
    current economic climate in general and in Conductus
    markets;

 

in connection with its decision to approve and
    recommend the merger, Conductus board of directors
    considered the opinion it received dated October 8, 2002,
    from Conductus financial advisor, U.S. Bancorp Piper
    Jaffray, as to the fairness as of such date, from a financial
    point of view, to the holders of Conductus stock, of the
    exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement. The full
    text of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays written opinion
    is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement filed by
    Superconductor in connection with this merger. Conductus
    stockholders are urged to read U.S. Bancorp Piper
    Jaffrays opinion carefully and in its entirety to
    understand the procedures followed, the assumptions made, the
    matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
    by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in rendering its opinion.
    U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays opinion was directed to
    the Conductus board of directors and does not constitute a
    recommendation to any stockholder as to any matter relating to
    the merger;

 

current financial market conditions and
    historical market prices, volatility and trading information for
    Conductus stock and Superconductor stock, and various factors
    that might affect the market value of Superconductor stock in
    the future;

 

the premium represented by the exchange ratio and
    the premiums paid in other recent transactions that could be
    viewed as comparable, as well as the negotiations between
    Conductus and Superconductor relating to the price per share,
    and exchange ratio; and

 

the terms of the merger agreement and related
    agreements, by themselves and in comparison to the terms of
    other transactions, and the intensive negotiations between
    Superconductor and Conductus, including their negotiations
    relating to the details of the conditions to the parties
    obligations to complete the merger, the details of the no
    shop restrictions on Conductus and the scope of these
    restrictions, potential conflict with fiduciary obligations, the
    parties termination rights, the termination fee that
    Conductus may be required to pay Superconductor in certain
    circumstances and the voting agreement.



The Conductus board of directors also identified
and considered a number of risks and uncertainties in its
deliberations concerning the merger, including the following:

 

the possibility that the dollar value of a share
    of Superconductor stock at the closing of the merger may be less
    than the dollar value of a share of Superconductor stock at the
    signing of the merger agreement and;

 

the fact that pursuant to the merger agreement,
    Conductus is required to obtain Superconductors consent
    before it can take a variety of actions between the signing and
    the closing of the merger;

 

the possibility that the merger may not be
    consummated and the effect of the public announcement of the
    merger on Conductus sales, customer relations and
    operating results and Conductus ability to attract and
    retain key management, marketing and technical personnel;

 

the risk that despite the efforts of the combined
    company, key technical, marketing and management personnel might
    not choose to remain employed by the combined company;

 

the risk that the potential benefits and
    synergies sought in the merger may not be fully realized, if at
    all;

 

the risk of customer hesitation about the impact
    of the merger on Conductus product design and
    manufacturing processes and potential delay or reduction in
    orders; and

 

various other risks associated with the
    businesses of Conductus, Superconductor and the combined company
    and the merger described under the section entitled Risk
    Factors beginning on page 19 of this document.

The Conductus board of directors concluded,
however, that many of these risks could be managed or mitigated
by Conductus or by the combined company or were unlikely to have
a material impact on the merger or the combined company, and
that, overall, the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and
potentially negative factors associated with the merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

The foregoing discussion of information and
factors considered and given weight by the Conductus board of
directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation
of the merger, the Conductus board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching
its determinations and recommendations.

Recommendation of the Conductus Board of
Directors

For the reasons discussed above, Conductus
board of directors unanimously approved the merger and the terms
of the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the
merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of
Conductus and its stockholders. Conductus board of
directors unanimously recommends that Conductus stockholders
vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the
merger.

In considering the recommendation of
Conductus board of directors with respect to the merger,
you should be aware that certain directors and officers of
Conductus have certain interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
Conductus stockholders generally as discussed below in the
section titled The Merger  Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger  Conductus on
page 53.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to
Conductus

Conductus retained U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray to act as its financial advisor, and, if requested, to
render to the board of directors an opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be
received by Conductus stockholders in the transaction.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray delivered to the
board of directors of Conductus on October 8, 2002, its
oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing), as of that
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors and
limitations set forth in the written opinion and described
below, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the common stockholders of
Conductus.



While U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered
its opinion and provided certain analyses to the board of
directors, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not requested to
and did not make any recommendation to the board of directors as
to the specific form or amount of the consideration to be
received by Conductus stockholders in the proposed merger, which
was determined through negotiations between Conductus and
Superconductor. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays written
opinion, which was directed to the Conductus board of directors,
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the exchange ratio set forth in the Agreement, does not address
Conductus underlying business decision to proceed with or
effect the merger or structure thereof, or the relative merits
of the merger compared to any alternative business strategy or
transaction in which Conductus might engage and does not
constitute a recommendation to any Conductus stockholder as to
how to vote in the merger. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was
not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, any expressions
of interest from any other parties with respect to any business
combination with Conductus or any other alternative transaction.

In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffrays review included:

 

a draft dated October 4, 2002, of the merger
    agreement;

 

a draft dated October 7, 2002, of the
    securities purchase agreement;

 

information, including financial planning data,
    relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets,
    liabilities and prospects of Conductus and Superconductor
    furnished to or discussed with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray by
    management of Conductus and Superconductor;

 

publicly available market and securities data of
    Conductus, Superconductor and of selected public companies
    deemed comparable to Conductus and Superconductor; and

 

to the extent publicly available, financial
    information relating to selected transactions deemed comparable
    to the proposed merger.

In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray visited
the headquarters of Conductus and Superconductor and conducted
discussions with members of senior management of both companies
concerning the financial condition, operating performance and
balance sheet characteristics of Conductus and Superconductor
and their views of the strategic rationale of the merger.

The following is a summary of the material
analyses and other information that U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray prepared and relied on in delivering its opinion to the
board of directors of Conductus.

     Implied
Consideration

Giving effect to the exchange ratio, resulting
implied value of Superconductor stock consideration of $0.69 per
share of Conductus common stock (based on the closing price for
Superconductor common stock on October 7, 2002), and the
outstanding Conductus common shares and common share
equivalents, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated the
aggregate implied value of the stock consideration payable in
the merger for Conductus common stock to be approximately
$15.5 million. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also
calculated the implied enterprise value (equity
value plus debt less cash) of Conductus to be approximately
$13.4 million. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also
calculated that the fully diluted shares issued to the
stockholders and option holders of Conductus would be an
aggregate of 34.9% of the total Superconductor common stock and
common stock equivalents based on share information furnished by
management of Superconductor and without considering the
Financing. In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray noted
that if the Financing occurs in accordance with the draft dated
October 7, 2002, of the securities purchase agreement, the
fully diluted shares issued to the stockholders and option
holders of Conductus would be approximately an aggregate of 25%
of the total Superconductor common stock and common stock
equivalents.

     Conductus and
Superconductor Market Analysis

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed general
background information concerning Conductus and Superconductor,
including recent financial and operating results and outlook,

Conductus and Superconductor described above to derive implied
exchange ratios ranging from a low of 0.489x to a high of 0.675x.

     Premiums Paid
Analysis

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed publicly
available information for selected transactions announced
between January 1, 2001 and October 7, 2002 with
transaction values of $10 million to $100 million
which U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray deemed similar to this
transaction to determine the implied premiums
(discounts) payable in the transactions over recent trading
prices. It selected these transactions by searching SEC filings,
public company disclosures, press releases, industry and popular
press reports, databases and other sources.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed its analysis
on 32 transactions. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray derived
implied equity values per share of Conductus common stock based
on the premiums (discounts) paid in these transactions ranging
from a low of $0.24 to a high of $1.58, with median implied per
share values of $0.70 to $0.87 and mean implied per share values
of $0.73 to $0.90.

     Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis

Conductus.
 U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a discounted cash flow analysis
for Conductus in which it calculated the present value of the
projected hypothetical future cash flows of Conductus based on



Conductus management estimates. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray estimated a range of theoretical values for
Conductus based on the net present value of its implied annual
cash flows and a terminal value for Conductus in 2006 calculated
based upon a multiple of revenue. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray applied a range of discount rates of 25% to 30% and a
range of terminal value multiples of 0.5x to 1.0x of forecasted
2006 revenue. This analysis resulted in implied per share values
of Conductus ranging from a low of $0.32 to a high of $1.17.

Superconductor.
 U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a discounted cash flow analysis
for Superconductor in which it calculated the present value of
the projected hypothetical future cash flows of Superconductor
based on Superconductor management estimates. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray estimated a range of theoretical values for
Superconductor based on the net present value of its implied
annual cash flows and a terminal value for Superconductor in
2006 calculated based upon a multiple of revenue.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray applied a range of discount
rates of 25% to 30% and a range of terminal value multiples of
0.5x to 1.0x of forecasted 2006 revenue. This analysis yielded
implied per share values of Superconductor ranging from a low of
$0.80 to a high of $1.95.

Relative Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis.
 U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
compared the mean and median implied per share equity values of
Superconductor with the mean and median implied per share equity
values computed for Conductus to derive an implied exchange
ratio range for Conductus and Superconductor. This analysis
indicated implied exchange ratios ranging from a low of 0.536x
to a high of 0.539x.

     Pro Forma
Analyses

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed pro forma
effects resulting from the impact of the transaction on the
projected earnings per share of the combined company for
calendar year 2003 based on management estimates of Conductus
and Superconductor and without including possible synergies and
other transaction related expenses. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
determined that the transaction could be dilutive for calendar
year 2003 to the projected stand-alone earnings per share of
Superconductor, without considering the financing. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray noted to the Conductus board of directors that the
financing could be additionally dilutive for calendar year 2003
to the projected stand-alone earnings per share of
Superconductor.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the expected
contributions of each of Conductus and Superconductor to revenue
of the combined company for calendar year 2002 based on publicly
available Wall Street estimates, and without including possible
synergies and other transaction related expenses. The analysis
indicated that Conductus would contribute to the combined entity
revenue of 23% for the full 2002 calendar year including 29.9%,
20.8%, 21.1% and 21.1% for the four calendar quarters,
respectively. In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed
the expected contributions of the companies on revenue and gross
margin of the combined company for calendar years 2002 and 2003
based on management estimates of Superconductor and Conductus
and without including possible synergies and other transaction
related expenses. The analysis indicated that Conductus would
contribute to the combined entity (i) revenue of 22.0% for
the full 2002 calendar year including 29.9%, 20.8%, 21.3% and
17.7% for the four calendar quarters, respectively,
(ii) revenue of 35.4% for the full 2003 calendar year
including 26.1%, 34.7%, 36.4% and 39.0% for the four calendar
quarters, respectively, and (iii) gross margin of 24.8% for
the full 2003 calendar year including 4.9%, 24.9%, 25.0% and
29.6% for the four calendar quarters, respectively.

In reaching its conclusion as to the fairness of
the exchange ratio and in its presentation to the board of
directors, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not rely on any single
analysis or factor described above, assign relative weights to
the analyses or factors considered by it, or make any conclusion
as to how the results of any given analysis, taken alone,
supported its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is
a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selection of portions of its analyses and of the factors
considered by it, without considering all of the factors and
analyses, would create a misleading view of the processes
underlying the opinion.

The analyses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by the analyses. Analyses relating to the value of companies do
not purport to be appraisals or valuations or necessarily
reflect the price at which companies may actually be sold. No
company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of
comparison is identical to Conductus, Superconductor or the
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
comparisons is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments about differences in the companies
to which Conductus and Superconductor were compared and other
factors that could affect the public trading value of the
companies.

For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
the financial statements and other information provided to it by
Conductus and Superconductor, or otherwise made available to it,
and did not assume responsibility for the independent
verification of that information. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
relied upon the assurances of the management of Conductus and
Superconductor that the information provided to it by Conductus
and Superconductor was prepared on a reasonable basis in
accordance with industry practice and the financial planning
data reflects the best currently available estimates and
judgment of Conductus and Superconductor respective
management, and management was not aware of any information or
facts that would make the information provided to U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray incomplete or misleading.

For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray assumed that neither Superconductor nor Conductus is a
party to any material pending transaction, including any
external financing, recapitalizations, acquisitions or merger
discussions, other than the merger and the Financing (which U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed, for purposes of its opinion,
would occur on the terms set forth in the draft dated
October 7, 2002, of the purchase agreement for the
financing). For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray



assumed that all the necessary regulatory
approvals and consents required for the transaction will be
obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect Conductus or
Superconductor or alter the terms of the transaction. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed the merger will qualify as a
reorganization under the United States Internal Revenue Code.

In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any
specific assets or liabilities of Conductus or Superconductor
and was not furnished with any such appraisals or valuations.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray undertook no independent analysis of any owned
real estate, or any pending or threatened litigation, including,
without limitation, the litigation involving ISCO International,
Inc., possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities, to which either Conductus or Superconductor or
their respective affiliates was a party or may be subject and
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays opinion made no assumption
concerning and therefore did not consider the possible assertion
of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray made no physical inspection of the
properties or assets of Conductus or Superconductor. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to the liquidation
value of any entity. Notwithstanding any going concern
qualification contained in the Report of Independent Accountants
dated February 15, 2002, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
relating to the financial statements of Conductus, Inc. of
December 31, 2001, the analyses performed by U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in connection with its opinion were going concern
analyses. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not requested to opine,
and no opinion was rendered, as to whether any analysis of an
entity, other than as a going concern, was appropriate in the
circumstance and, accordingly, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
performed no such analyses.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion
as to the price at which shares of Conductus or Superconductor
common stock have traded or at which such shares may trade at
any future time. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays opinion
addressed only the exchange ratio and no other transaction terms
or arrangements. The opinion is based on information available
to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and the facts and circumstances as
they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of the
opinion. Events occurring after that date could materially
affect the assumptions used in preparing the opinion. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray has not undertaken to and is not obligated
to affirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment on any
events occurring after the date it was given.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as a customary part
of its investment banking business, is engaged in the valuation
of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, underwritings and secondary distributions of
securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and its affiliates may
actively trade securities of Conductus and Superconductor for
their own accounts or the accounts of their customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
such securities.

Under the terms of the engagement letter,
Conductus paid U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a $50,000 retainer fee
upon execution of the engagement letter and has agreed to pay
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a fee of two percent of the aggregate
consideration paid up to $50 million, plus 1.5% of such
consideration above $50 million (provided that in no event
shall such fee be less than $500,000) in connection with a
purchase or sale transaction of Conductus, for U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffrays financial advisory services. Conductus also
agreed to pay U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a fee of $250,000 for
rendering its opinion that will be credited against payment of
the fee for financial advisory services. Whether or not the
transaction is consummated, Conductus has agreed to pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
and to indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray against liabilities
incurred. These liabilities include liabilities under the
federal securities laws in connection with the engagement of
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray by the board of directors.

Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger  Conductus

In considering the recommendation of
Conductus board of directors with respect to the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,
you should be aware that certain members of the management of
Conductus and Conductus board of directors may have
interests in the merger that are



different from, or in addition to, your
interests. Conductus board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among others, in approving and
adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger.

Optionholders

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Superconductor
will assume each outstanding Conductus stock option other than
options granted under Conductus 1994 Director Option Plan.

Employment and Change in Control
    Agreements

Conductus does not have any employment agreements
with any of its executive officers and their employment may be
terminated at any time at the discretion of Conductus
board of directors.

In October 2002, Conductus entered into
individual change in control agreements with each of
its executive officers. The persons covered by these change in
control agreements include Mr. Shalvoy, James Simmons, Syed
Zaidi, Randy Simon, Richard Weiss, Hank Scherf and Ron
Wilderink. Consummation of the merger with Superconductor will
constitute a change in control under these agreements.

Each of the change in control agreements provides
for severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of
employment. The agreements generally provide that if the
employees employment is terminated within thirty-six
months of a change in control of Conductus either by
(i) Conductus for any reason other than death,
Cause or Disability (as both terms are
defined in the change in control agreements) or (ii) by the
employee for Good Reason, then the terminated
employee will be entitled to receive severance benefits.
Good Reason generally means that the employee has
sustained a material reduction in authority or responsibility,
incurred a reduction in total compensation, or been notified
that his principal place of work will be relocated by 50 miles
or more.

Severance benefits include salary continuation
payments, as well as continued health/life insurance benefits.
Salary continuation payments would be made on a monthly basis to
the former employee, subject to earlier acceleration under
certain circumstances specified in the agreements, for a
specified number of months. The aggregate amount received by
each individual would be multiple of that employees annual
salary. The multiplier is 1.25 for Mr. Wilderink, 1.0 for
Messrs. Simmons, Simon, Weiss and Scherf, and 0.5 for
Mr. Zaidi. Subject to earlier cessation under certain
circumstances, the post-termination health/life insurance
coverage would be provided for 18 months for
Mr. Shalvoy, 15 months for Mr. Wilderink,
12 months for Messrs. Simmons, Simon, Weiss and
Scherf, and 6 months for Mr. Zaidi. Each such employee
would also be able to exercise his stock options for up to five
years after termination of employment. Additionally,
Mr. Weiss agreement provides that Conductus would
also continue to pay to Mr. Weiss a home purchase
differential if he becomes entitled to severance benefits. Any
payments or distributions made to or for the benefit of the
named employees under these change in control agreements will be
reduced, if necessary, to an amount that would result in no
excise taxes being imposed under Internal Revenue Code section
4999.

Under the change in control agreements, the
exercise date of the employees vested options and/or
warrants would be extended to the lesser of five years after the
date of a qualifying termination or the term of such
equity-based security. However, if at any time before
December 31, 2004, the employee becomes an employee of a
competing company, as defined in the change in control
agreement, all of that employees vested options would
expire within 90 days after he commences such competing
employment. In addition, certain officers will be entitled to
accelerated vesting if he is involuntarily terminated within
12 months of the transaction.

Mr. Shalvoys change in control
agreement is similar to the other change in control agreements
but it also provides that he would receive a retention payment
equal to 1.5 times his annual salary, if he remains a full-time
employee of Conductus through May 2003 and the change in control
is completed before June 2003. Mr. Shalvoy would also then
be entitled to participate, on a pro-rata basis, in any bonus
plan offered to senior executives of Superconductor. The
retention payment would be paid out over 18 months or
earlier in a lump sum, upon Mr. Shalvoys election.



The retention payment made to Mr. Shalvoy
would be equal to the sum of (i) 1.5 times
Mr. Shalvoys annual salary, and
(ii) Mr. Shalvoys monthly salary for the number
of months remaining, if any, prior to June 2003 after he becomes
entitled to severance benefits. If Mr. Shalvoy receives a
retention payment, he will not be eligible for the salary
continuation payments. Mr. Shalvoys agreement has a
slightly modified Good Reason definition that includes material
reductions in title and status and his agreement also provides
that under certain circumstances his employment may continue in
a limited capacity with significantly reduced compensation. The
outstanding principal balance of $820,244 plus any accrued
interest on Mr. Shalvoys two loans with Conductus,
which are otherwise scheduled to be paid in full in December
2005 and August 2006, shall become due and payable upon
Mr. Shalvoys termination of employment.

     Continuing
Directors

Three persons who are currently directors of
Conductus will serve as directors of Superconductor after the
merger.

     Acceleration
and Extension of Option Exercise for Non-Employee
Directors

Upon the consummation of the merger, the
Conductus non-employee directors will receive a grant of stock
options in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of their
outstanding stock options that were previously awarded under a
formula option grant program. The new options will contain the
same terms and conditions as the surrendered options with the
exception that the new options will provide for (i) an
extended option exercise period following the individuals
cessation of service as a director and (ii) accelerated
vesting of any unvested options. The canceled options generally
provide that the non-employee director has up to three months to
exercise his/her option following termination of service as a
director. The new option grants will generally provide that,
following termination of service as a director, the option
holder will be able to exercise his/her options until the
earlier of: (i) five years after such termination of
service or (ii) the original expiration date of the
applicable surrendered options.

Participation in Superconductors
    Financing

Several of Conductus directors represent
large institutional stockholders of Conductus, in which several
of these directors have a pecuniary interest. Concurrently with
the merger, the Alloy Ventures family of funds, represented by
Dr. John Shoch on Conductus board, and entities
associated with Mr. William Edwards will participate in
Superconductors private financing in which they will
acquire Superconductor stock at a below market price.

     Indemnification

Under the merger agreement, Superconductor has
agreed to honor Conductus obligations under the
indemnification agreements between Conductus and its directors
and officers in effect before the merger and any indemnification
provisions in Conductus amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and bylaws. Superconductor has also agreed, for
a period of six years after the closing of the merger, to
indemnify and hold harmless the officers and directors of
Conductus for any costs, expenses or losses related to any claim
or suit arising out of any action taken in such
individuals capacity as an officer or director of
Conductus, provided that such action pertains to events which
occurred prior to the closing of the merger.

     Insurance

Superconductor has agreed to maintain
directors and officers liability insurance covering
the persons who are currently covered by Conductus
directors and officers liability insurance policy
for six years from the closing of the merger, provided that
Superconductor is not required to pay more than $700,000 (plus
the amount of any refunds or credits) to maintain such coverage.

Conductus stockholders should consider
whether these interests may have influenced the directors and
officers of Conductus to support or recommend the merger.



Completion and Effectiveness of the
Merger

The merger will be completed when all of the
conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived,
including the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger by the Conductus stockholders and
approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the issuance of
shares of Superconductor stock in the merger by the
Superconductor stockholders. The merger will become effective
upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware.

Structure of the Merger and Conversion of
Conductus stock

STI Acquisition Inc. is a newly formed and wholly
owned subsidiary of Superconductor referred to in this document
as Merger Sub. To effect the merger, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Conductus, with Conductus being the surviving
corporation.

Upon completion of the merger, shares of
Conductus stock (other than shares held by Conductus or any of
its subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive
shares of Superconductor stock as described in the section
titled Merger Consideration on page 60. No
fractional shares of Superconductor stock will be issued in the
merger. Instead of a fractional share, each Conductus
stockholder who receives Superconductor stock as merger
consideration will receive an amount of cash (rounded down to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average price of a share
of Superconductor stock for the 20-day period prior to the
merger.

Exchange of Conductus Stock
Certificates

Promptly after the effective time of the merger,
if you are the holder of a Conductus stock certificate, the
exchange agent for the merger, will mail to you a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Conductus
stock certificates in exchange for Superconductor stock
certificates, cash and any dividends or other distributions, if
any, to which you are or may be entitled. When you deliver your
Conductus stock certificates to the exchange agent for the
merger, along with a properly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents, you will receive
Superconductor stock certificates representing the number of
full shares of Superconductor common stock, and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, to which you are entitled under the merger
agreement. 
You should not submit your Conductus stock
certificates for exchange until you receive instructions from
the exchange agent for the merger.

You are not entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions on Superconductor common stock until you
have surrendered your Conductus stock certificates in exchange
for Superconductor stock certificates. Promptly after your
Superconductor stock certificates are issued, you will receive
payment for any dividend or other distribution on Superconductor
common stock with a record date after the merger and a payment
date prior to the date you surrender your Conductus stock
certificates.

Superconductor will only issue a Superconductor
stock certificate in a name other than the exact name in which a
surrendered Conductus stock certificate is registered if you
present the exchange agent with all documents required to show
and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership of the shares of
Conductus common stock formerly represented by the Conductus
stock certificate, and show that you paid any applicable stock
transfer taxes.

If your stock certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, you may be required to deliver an affidavit and a
lost certificate bond as a condition to receiving your
Superconductor stock certificate.

Treatment of Conductus Equity-Based
Awards

As of October 22, 2002, Conductus had
outstanding options to purchase approximately 2,833,757 shares
of Conductus stock under existing option agreements and
Conductus stock option plans. Upon the merger,
Superconductor will assume all options to purchase Conductus
stock then outstanding under Conductus option agreements and
Conductus stock option plans. In addition, as of the effective
time, the Conductus employee stock purchase plan will be
terminated.



Treatment of Warrants

As of October 22, 2002, Conductus had
outstanding warrants to purchase 2,441,247 shares of Conductus
stock under existing warrant agreements. Superconductor will
assume all outstanding warrants for Conductus stock in
accordance with the terms of such warrants. Each warrant assumed
by Superconductor may be exercised for the number of shares of
Superconductor common stock equal to the exchange ratio
multiplied by the number of shares of Conductus common stock
subject to the warrant immediately prior to the merger, and
rounded down to the nearest whole share (with cash, less the
applicable exercise price, payable for any fraction of a share).
The per share exercise price under each warrant assumed shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under the
warrant by the exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest
cent (to the extent permitted by the terms of the warrants).

Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger

The following are the material United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger, assuming that you
hold your shares of Conductus stock and warrants to purchase
Conductus stock as capital assets. The following discussion is
based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, its
legislative history, applicable Treasury regulations,
administrative rulings and court decisions currently in effect,
all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect, and assumptions, limitations,
representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of officers of Conductus, Superconductor and Merger
Sub expected to be executed as of the date of the completion of
the merger. The following discussion further assumes that the
merger will be consummated in accordance with the provisions of
the agreement and plan of merger. The following discussion
further does not address all aspects of United States federal
income taxation that may be important to you in light of your
particular circumstances, or if you are subject to special
rules, such as rules relating to:

 

Stockholders who are not citizens or residents of
    the United States;

 

Financial institutions;

 

Tax-exempt organizations;

 

Insurance companies;

 

Mutual funds;

 

Dealers in securities;

 

Stockholders who received their warrants, options
    or shares of Conductus stock in connection with the performance
    of services or by exercising warrants, options or rights to
    purchase Conductus stock received in connection with the
    performance of services; and

 

Stockholders who hold their shares of Conductus
    stock as qualified small business stock under
    Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, or as part of a
    hedge, straddle or a constructive sale or conversion transaction.

On the date that the merger is completed, Orrick,
Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, counsel to Conductus will,
subject to the qualifications discussed in the following
paragraph, deliver its opinion to Conductus and Superconductor,
dated the date that the merger is completed, to the effect that,
for United States federal income tax purposes, the merger will
be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Provided that
the merger qualifies as a reorganization, the following federal
income tax consequences will result:

 

No gain or loss will be recognized by Conductus
    or Superconductor as a result of the merger.

 

No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of
    Superconductor stock as a result of the merger.

 

No gain or loss will be recognized by you when
    you exchange all of your Conductus stock solely for
    Superconductor stock in the merger, except that gain or loss may
    be recognized by you with respect to cash received in lieu of a
    fractional share interest in Superconductor stock.



 

The aggregate tax basis of the Superconductor
    stock you receive in the merger will be the same as your
    aggregate tax basis in the Conductus stock you surrender in the
    merger, except that your aggregate tax basis in Superconductor
    stock will be reduced by the tax basis allocable to any
    fractional share interest in Superconductor stock for which you
    receive cash.

 

You will recognize gain or loss for United States
    federal income tax purposes with respect to the cash you receive
    instead of a fractional share interest in Superconductor stock,
    measured by the difference between the amount of cash you
    receive and the portion of the tax basis of your shares of
    Conductus stock that is allocable to the fractional share
    interest in Superconductor stock. This gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or
    loss if your shares of Conductus stock have been held for more
    than one year at the time the merger is completed.

 

The tax holding period of the Superconductor
    stock that you receive in the merger (including any fractional
    interest for which you receive cash as described above) will
    include the period during which you held the Conductus stock
    surrendered in the merger.

 

No gain or loss will be recognized by you when
    your warrants to purchase Conductus stock are exchanged for
    warrants to purchase Superconductor stock in the merger, the
    aggregate tax basis of the warrants to purchase Superconductor
    stock you receive in the merger will be the same as your
    aggregate tax basis in your pre-merger Conductus warrants and
    the holding period of the warrants to purchase Superconductor
    stock you receive in the merger will include the period during
    which you held the pre-merger Conductus warrants.

Conductus and Superconductors
obligation to complete the merger is conditioned on receipt of a
closing tax opinion from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP
regarding the United States federal income tax treatment of the
merger. The closing tax opinion (1) will be based on facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in the
closing tax opinion that are consistent with the facts existing
at the time that the merger occurs and (2) may rely on
representations and covenants including those contained in
certificates of officers of Conductus, Superconductor, Merger
Sub, and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP. The closing tax
opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither
Conductus nor Superconductor intend to request a ruling from the
IRS with respect to the merger. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set
forth in the closing tax opinion or that a court will not
sustain such a challenge. Neither Conductus nor Superconductor
currently intends to waive the condition relating to the receipt
of a closing tax opinion.

If you receive cash in lieu of a fractional share
interest in Superconductor stock, you may be subject to backup
withholding at a rate of 30% on the cash payments you receive.
Backup withholding will not apply, however, if you are an exempt
recipient (such as a corporation) or are otherwise exempt from
backup withholding, if you furnish your taxpayer identification
number and certify that you are not subject to backup
withholding on the substitute IRS Form W-9 included in the
Transmittal Letter, or you provide a certificate of foreign
status on IRS Form W-8BEN.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be
a complete analysis or description of all potential United
States federal income tax consequences or any other consequences
of the merger and, except as described herein, does not address
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to or concurrently
with the merger whether or not such transactions are in
connection with the merger. In addition, this discussion does
not address tax consequences which may vary with, or are
contingent on, your individual circumstances. Moreover, this
discussion does not address any non-income tax or any foreign,
state or local tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, you
are strongly urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine
the particular United States federal, state, local or foreign
income or other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

Superconductor will account for the merger as a
purchase for financial accounting purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
For purposes of preparing Superconduc-



tors consolidated financial statements,
Superconductor will establish a new accounting basis for
Conductus assets and liabilities based upon their
estimated fair values as of the closing of the merger, the
merger consideration and the costs of the merger. Any excess of
cost over the estimated fair value of the net assets of
Conductus will be recorded by Superconductor as goodwill. A
final determination of the intangible asset values and required
purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made.
Superconductor will determine the fair value of Conductus
assets and liabilities and will make appropriate purchase
accounting adjustments, including adjustments to the
amortization period of the intangible assets, upon completion of
that determination.

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to
Complete the Merger

Superconductor and Conductus do not believe that
any material governmental filings in the United States or other
foreign jurisdictions, other than the certificate of merger in
Delaware, are required with respect to the merger.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates
of Superconductor or Conductus

The issuance of Superconductor stock in the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act. These shares
will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for
shares of Superconductor stock issued to any person who is an
affiliate of Conductus (or becomes an affiliate of
Superconductor following the merger). Persons who may be deemed
to be affiliates of Conductus include individuals or entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with Conductus and may include some of the officers and
directors of Conductus, as well as the principal stockholders of
Conductus. For a period of one year following the merger,
affiliates of Conductus may not sell their shares of
Superconductor stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to
(1) an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, (2) in
compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act or
(3) any other applicable exemption under the Securities
Act. After the one-year anniversary of the merger,
Superconductor shares held by affiliates of Conductus (who are
not affiliates of Superconductor) will be freely tradable.
Shares held by affiliates of Superconductor will continue be
subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

Rights of Dissenting Stockholders

Neither Superconductor stockholders nor Conductus
stockholders will be entitled to any appraisal rights under the
Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law in
connection with the merger.

Listing of Superconductor Stock to Be Issued
in the Merger

It is a condition to the closing of the merger
that the shares of Superconductor stock to be issued in the
merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market,
subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of Conductus
stock after the Merger

If the merger is completed, Conductus stock will
be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act. Consequently, following
completion of the merger, Conductus stockholders will no longer
be able to trade shares of Conductus stock on any stock exchange.



THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material
provisions of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to
this proxy statement/prospectus. This description is not
complete, and you are urged to read the full text of the merger
agreement. In addition, important information about the merger
agreement and the merger is provided in the previous section
titled The Merger beginning on
page 36.

Effective Time and Effect of Merger

The merger will become effective upon the filing
of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to in
writing by Superconductor, Conductus and Merger Sub. That time
is the effective time of the merger. The closing of
the merger will occur no later than the third business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger
unless the parties agree otherwise. The date upon which the
closing occurs is the closing date of the merger.
The certificate of merger will be filed on the closing date. The
closing and the effective time are anticipated to occur no later
than December 31, 2002.

At the effective time, Merger Sub will cease to
exist as a corporation and will be merged with and into
Conductus, with Conductus being the surviving corporation.

Merger Consideration

Each Conductus stockholder will have the right to
receive 0.6 shares of Superconductor stock for each share
of Conductus stock held by the stockholder.

A Conductus stockholder will not receive any
fraction of a share of Superconductor stock in the merger. All
fractions of a share of Superconductor stock that a given
Conductus stockholder is entitled to receive will be aggregated.
Any fractional share of Superconductor stock remaining after the
aggregation will be paid in cash equal to the fraction
multiplied by the average price of a share of Superconductor
stock during the 20-day period prior to the merger.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement,
Conductus and Superconductor expect that the closing date will
be the day of or the next business day after the Conductus
stockholders and Superconductor stockholders vote to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. It is
expected that the Superconductor and Conductus special meetings
of stockholders will be held on December 17, 2002. However,
the merger is subject to governmental and regulatory approvals
and other conditions, some of which are beyond
Superconductors and Conductus control, and,
therefore, Superconductor and Conductus cannot predict the exact
timing of the completion of the merger.

Exchange of Conductus Stock
Certificates

Holders of certificates previously representing
Conductus stock will not be paid dividends or distributions on
any Superconductor common shares or cash they are entitled to
receive as merger consideration, and will not be paid cash in
lieu of a fractional Superconductor stock, until their Conductus
stock certificates are surrendered for exchange. When the
certificates are surrendered, any unpaid dividends declared by
Superconductor after the consummation of the merger and any cash
in lieu of a fractional Superconductor stock will be paid
without interest.

The exchange agent will deliver the merger
consideration in exchange for lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates if the owner of such certificates signs an
affidavit of loss, theft or destruction, as appropriate. The
exchange agent may also, in its discretion, require the holder
of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond
in a reasonable sum as indemnity against any claim that might be
made against Superconductor or the exchange agent with respect
to alleged lost, stolen or destroyed certificates.



Treatment of Conductus Equity-Based
Awards

As of October 22, 2002, Conductus had
outstanding options to purchase approximately 2,833,757 shares
of Conductus stock under existing option agreements and
Conductus stock option plans. Upon the merger,
Superconductor will assume all options to purchase Conductus
stock then outstanding under Conductus option agreements and
Conductus stock option plans.

Each Conductus option that is outstanding and
unexercised upon the consummation of the merger will be
converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of
Superconductor stock equal to the exchange ratio multiplied by
the number of shares of Conductus stock covered by the option
immediately before the merger (rounded down to the nearest whole
stock). The exercise price per share of Superconductor stock
subject to each option will equal its pre-conversion price per
share of Conductus stock subject to such option divided by the
exchange ratio (rounded to five decimal places). In the event
the aggregate exercise price results in the payment of a
fraction of a cent at the time of exercise, the aggregate
exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The
exchange ratio is described above under the caption The
Merger Agreement  Merger Consideration. Within
45 business days after the closing of the merger, Superconductor
will file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register the
Superconductor stock issuable upon exercise of the Conductus
options it assumes in the merger.

In addition, Conductus amended its employee stock
purchase plan to provide that as of the effective time of the
merger no additional purchase rights will be issued and all
outstanding purchase rights will terminate on the date of the
merger.

Treatment of Warrants

As of October 22, 2002, Conductus had
outstanding warrants to purchase 2,441,247 shares of Conductus
stock under existing warrant agreements. Superconductor will
assume all outstanding warrants for Conductus stock in
accordance with the terms of such warrants. Each warrant assumed
by Superconductor may be exercised for the number of shares of
Superconductor common stock equal to the exchange ratio
multiplied by the number of shares of Conductus common stock
subject to the warrant immediately prior to the merger, and
rounded down to the nearest whole share (with cash, less the
applicable exercise price, payable for any fraction of a share).
The per share exercise price under each warrant assumed shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under the
warrant by the exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest
cent (to the extent permitted by the terms of the warrants).

Representations and Warranties

Each of Conductus and Superconductor have made
customary representations and warranties to the other in the
merger agreement. To review these representations and
warranties, please refer to the text of the merger agreement
attached as 
Annex A
 to this proxy statement/
prospectus. None of the representations and warranties will
survive the effective time of the merger.

Conduct of Business of Superconductor and
Conductus Prior to the Effective Time

Until the earlier of the termination of the
merger agreement or the effective time, each of Superconductor
and Conductus has agreed to conduct its operations according to
its ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past
practice and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
intact its business organization, to keep available the services
of its officers and employees in each business function and to
maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers,
distributors, customers and others having business relationships
with it.

The merger agreement includes a non-exclusive
list of limitations on the actions of Superconductor and
Conductus during this period in addition to the general
statements above. To review the list of limitations on each
parties conduct of business, please refer to the text of
the merger agreement attached as 
Annex A
 to the
proxy statement/prospectus.



The merger agreement further provides that
Conductus will not take, without the prior written consent of
Superconductor, any of the following actions until the earlier
of the termination of the merger agreement or the effective time:

 

adopt or amend any option plan;

 

increase compensation or severance to executive
    officer or employee, except as required by existing agreements
    or ordinary course or business, or terminate any employee except
    for cause;

 

incur indebtedness outside the ordinary course of
    business in excess of $25,000; and

 

other than in the ordinary course, permit its
    assets to be encumbered.

Conduct of Business Following the
Merger

Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Conductus. As a result, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a
corporation and Conductus will be the surviving corporation of
the merger. All the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Merger Sub will vest in Conductus, and all the
debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub will becomes the
debts, liabilities and duties of Conductus. Conductus, the
surviving corporation, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Superconductor.

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time
will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
surviving corporation. At the effective time, the certificate of
incorporation will be amended so that the name of the surviving
corporation is Conductus, Inc. The directors and
officers of Merger Sub at the effective time will become the
initial directors and officers of the surviving corporation.

Superconductor will enlarge its board of
directors to a total of twelve (12) members following the
merger and the concurrent private financing. The board will
consist of all eight (8) of the current directors of
Superconductor, three (3) new directors from the board of
Conductus and one (1) new director chosen by certain
investors affiliated with the Special Situations Funds. The
three new directors from Conductus will be Martin A. Kaplan,
David L. Short and Charles E. Shalvoy. The Special Situations
Funds appointee is Robert J. Majteles.

At the next annual meeting of stockholders,
Superconductor will reduce its board of directors to a total of
ten (10) members. The board will then consist of six
(6) individuals chosen by the eight (8) current
directors of Superconductor from among the eight
(8) current directors of Superconductor, two
(2) individuals chosen by the current eight
(8) directors of Superconductor from among the current
directors of Conductus (who will be Messrs. Kaplan and
Short), Mr. John Shoch (or another person designated by
Alloy Ventures Fund 2000, LLC, an investor in the financing,
acceptable to the current directors of Superconductor) and one
(1) representative chosen by the investors affiliated with
the Special Situations Funds (who will be Robert J. Majteles).

No Solicitation

Until the earlier of the termination of the
merger agreement or the effective time of the merger, Conductus
has agreed that it will not, and its subsidiaries will not, and
that it will use reasonable efforts to cause its or any of its
subsidiaries officers, directors, affiliates, employees,
attorneys, investment bankers or other advisors or
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 

solicit or initiate any proposal or offer
    (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its
    stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
    lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined below);

 

enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
    negotiate with any person or entity in furtherance of such
    inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction;

 

agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction; or

 

authorize or permit any of its representatives to
    take any such action.



Conductus has agreed to immediately notify
Superconductor if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or
contact with any person with respect thereto, regarding a
Competing Transaction is made, and Conductus has agreed to
immediately inform Superconductor as to the material details of
any such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact, including, without
limitation, the identity of the party making any such proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact, and, if in writing, promptly deliver
to Superconductor a copy of such proposal, offer, inquiry or
contact and any other written material relating thereto.

By signing the merger agreement, Conductus agreed
to immediately cease all discussions or negotiations with any
parties previously conducted with respect to a Competing
Transaction. Additionally, Conductus agreed not to release any
third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality
or standstill agreement to which Conductus is a party.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Conductus board of directors may furnish information to,
and enter into discussions with, a person who has made an
unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding a
Competing Transaction if Conductus board of directors has:

 

reasonably concluded after consultation with U.S.
    Bancorp Piper Jaffray or other financial advisor of nationally
    recognized reputation that such proposal or offer constitutes a
    Superior Proposal (as more specifically discussed below);

 

reasonably concluded, after consultation with its
    outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal,
    the furnishing of such information or entering into discussions
    is required to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
    Conductus and its stockholders under applicable Federal and
    state law, provided Conductus first gives Superconductor written
    notice of the intent to furnish information or enter into
    discussions with such person at least three business days prior
    to taking any such action; and

 

obtained from such person an executed
    confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to
    terms contained in the non-disclosure agreement to which
    Conductus and Superconductor are both signatories.

A 
Competing Transaction
 means
any of the following involving Conductus:

 

a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
    combination or other similar transaction;

 

any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
    transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of
    Conductus;

 

a tender offer or exchange offer for, or any
    offer to purchase directly from Conductus 20% or more of the
    outstanding voting securities of Conductus;

 

any solicitation in opposition to adoption by
    Conductus stockholders of the merger proposal; or

 

any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or
    other significant corporate reorganization of Conductus.

A 
Superior Proposal
 means an
unsolicited written bona fide offer made by a third party to
consummate a Competing Transaction:

 

that is not attributable to a material breach by
    Conductus of the applicable merger agreement provisions; and

 

on terms (including conditions to consummation of
    the contemplated transaction) that the board of directors of
    Conductus determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment
    (based on the written advice of the U.S. Bancorp Piper
    Jaffray or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
    reputation), to be more favorable to the Conductus stockholders
    from a financial point of view than the terms of the merger and
    with any financing required to consummate the transaction
    contemplated by such offer committed or likely, in the
    reasonable good faith judgment of the Conductus board of
    directors (based on the written advice of a financial adviser of
    nationally recognized reputation), to be obtained by such third
    party on a timely basis.



To the extent a Superior Proposal is received,
Conductus has agreed to furnish Superconductor all information
provided to the person who has made the Superior Proposal, to
the extent that such information has not been previously
provided to Superconductor and shall keep Superconductor
promptly and reasonably informed as to the status of any
discussions regarding such Superior Proposal.

Conductus board of directors may not
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor
of the merger unless all of the conditions below are met:

 

a Superior Proposal is made and not withdrawn;

 

Conductus provides written notice to
    Superconductor of receipt of the Superior Proposal in the manner
    described above;

 

Superconductor has not, within five business days
    of its receipt of notice of the Superior Proposal, made an offer
    that Conductus board of directors concludes in good faith,
    based upon written advice of its financial advisor, to be more
    favorable to Conductus stockholders than the Superior
    Proposal;

 

Conductus board of directors concludes,
    after consultation with legal counsel, that, in light of such
    Superior Proposal, the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or
    modify its recommendation would be inconsistent with its
    fiduciary obligations to Conductus stockholders under
    Federal and state law; and

 

Conductus has not violated its agreement not to
    solicit Competing Proposals.

Unless the merger agreement has been terminated
in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement must be
submitted to Conductus stockholders for approval and
adoption regardless of whether Conductus board of
directors has withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified its
recommendation in favor of the merger as set forth above.

Certain Other Covenants

     Indemnification
and Insurance

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the surviving corporation will contain the same provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement and director exculpation
as contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Conductus on the date the merger agreement was signed, and those
provisions cannot be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
six years following the merger in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights of persons who at any time prior to merger
were entitled to indemnification, advancement or exculpation
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Conductus,
unless the modification is required by law.

For six years following the merger,
Superconductor, as the the surviving corporation, will indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director or officer of
Conductus or any of its subsidiaries and each person who served
at the request of Conductus or any of its subsidiaries as a
director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise against all
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the merger), whether civil, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacities as officers or directors, in each
case occurring before the merger.

Superconductor also will maintain Conductus
current directors and officers liability insurance policies for
six years after the merger, although Superconductor is not
obligated to spend more than an aggregate of $700,000 in that
six year period (plus the amount of any refunds or credits) to
maintain such coverage.

     Employee
Matters

The Conductus employees will continue on their
existing benefit plans until such time as, in
Superconductors sole discretion, an orderly transition can
be accomplished and the employees may be transferred to employee
benefit plans and programs maintained by Superconductor.
Superconductor will take reasonable



actions, to the extent permitted by its benefit
programs, as are necessary to allow eligible employees of
Conductus to participate in the health, welfare and other
employee benefits (excluding equity incentive plans for this
purpose) programs of Superconductor or alternative benefits
programs in the aggregate substantially equivalent to those
applicable to employees of Superconductor in similar functions
and positions on similar terms. Pending such action,
Superconductor will maintain the effectiveness of
Conductus benefit plans. Each continuing employee will be
given credit, for purposes of any service requirements for
participation or vesting, for his or her period of service with
Conductus credited under a similar benefit plan or program prior
to the merger.

expenses associated with any other regulatory filing associated

Amendment and Waiver; Parties in
Interest

Superconductor, Merger Sub and Conductus may
together amend the merger agreement in writing by action taken
by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to completion of the merger.

At any time prior to the completion of the
merger, any of Superconductor, Merger Sub or Conductus may waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
the merger agreement. Any waiver will be valid if set forth in
writing signed by the party or parties granting the waiver.

The merger agreement is binding on upon and
inures solely to the benefit of the parties thereto, and nothing
in the merger agreement confers upon any other person any right,
benefit, remedy or obligation, other than the indemnification
and insurance obligations of Superconductor and the surviving
corporation following the completion of the merger, which are
intended for the benefit of certain specified officers and
directors of Conductus and may be enforced by such individuals.



Other Agreements

The following is a summary of the material
provisions of the voting agreement signed by certain
stockholders of Superconductor, the affiliate agreements to be
signed at the closing of the merger by certain officers and
directors of Conductus and the purchase agreement signed by
investors in the financing which is a condition to closing of
the merger.

     Voting
Agreements

Superconductor Stockholder Voting
Agreements.
 As of October 10,
2002, certain affiliates of The Hillman Company owned 6,183,472
shares of Superconductor stock representing approximately 25% of
the then outstanding shares of Superconductor stock. The Hillman
Company also has two representatives on Superconductors
board of directors. The affiliates of The Hillman Company have
entered into a voting agreement with Conductus. The voting
agreement requires them to vote all of their shares of
Superconductor stock:

 

in favor of the approval of the merger and the
    merger agreement, and any matter that could reasonably be
    expected to facilitate the merger;

 

against any action or agreement that would result
    in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
    obligation or agreement of Superconductor under the merger
    agreement; and

 

against any action or agreement that would cause
    any provision contained in Article VII of the merger
    agreement to not be satisfied.

Those stockholders also agreed not to transfer
any of their shares of Superconductor stock, tender any of their
shares of Superconductor stock to any person, or create or
permit any encumbrance on their shares of Superconductor stock
which affects, directly or indirectly, the right to vote the
shares as provided in the voting agreement. None of those
stockholders received any consideration for entering into the
voting agreement. The voting agreement terminates on the earlier
to occur of the date of the termination of the merger agreement
or the effective date of the merger.

Conductus Stockholder Voting
Agreements.
 Superconductor did not
request that any stockholders of Conductus sign voting
agreements.

     Affiliate
Agreements

Prior to the closing of the merger,
Superconductor will enter into affiliate agreements with those
Conductus directors, officers, stockholders or employees who are
affiliates of Conductus within the meaning of the Securities
Act. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, each Conductus
affiliate will agree not to dispose of his, her or its shares of
Superconductor stock received in the merger unless the
disposition is permitted under the rules and regulations of the
federal securities laws.

     Purchase
Agreement for Related Private Financing

Superconductor has secured financing commitments
of $20 million pursuant to a purchase agreement dated
October 10, 2002 as amended. The investors under the
purchase agreement include funds affiliated with an existing
investor of Superconductor, The Hillman Company, funds
affiliated with an existing investor of Conductus, Alloy
Ventures, and funds affiliated with existing investors of both
companies, Wellington Management Company, LLP, Specials
Situations Funds and Palo Alto Investors. The commitments under
the purchase agreement are expressly conditioned on the
consummation of the merger. Similarly, because
Supercondutors board of directors believes outside capital
is critical to the combined companys success, the receipt
of $15 million of private financing is a condition to the
closing of the merger. By virtue of this structure, the
financing transaction is subject to the numerous closing
conditions to the merger, which are enumerated in the discussion
under the merger proposal entitled Conditions to the
Completion of the Merger beginning on page 65. If
both the merger and Superconductors proposal for the
financing are approved, the transactions would close
simultaneously. The purchase agreement provides that (i) a
representative from Special



Situations Funds, who is Robert J. Majteles, will
be added to Superconductors board upon consummation of the
merger and (ii) at the next annual meeting of stockholders,
Mr. John Shoch (or another person designated by Alloy
Ventures Fund 2000, LLC acceptable to the Superconductor board)
will be appointed.

In the financing, the investors would receive up
to 21,096,954 shares of common stock, in excess of 20% of the
outstanding shares of Superconductor stock before giving effect
to the merger and the financing transaction. The shares would be
sold at a purchase price of $0.95 per share, approximately 15%
less than the market value of the shares as of the date of the
purchase agreement. The investors also would acquire warrants to
purchase an additional 5,274,240 shares having an exercise
price of $1.19 per share, approximately 25% above the market
value of the shares as of the date of the purchase agreement.

The investors would acquire unregistered
Superconductor stock in the financing transaction pursuant to
the exemption from the registration requirements of
Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by
Section 4(2) and Regulation D of that act. Under the
terms of the purchase agreement, Superconductor would file a
registration statement with the SEC within thirty (30) days
of the effective date of the merger to register the shares of
Superconductor stock issued in the private financing and
issuable upon exercise of their warrants. Superconductor has
agreed to use its best efforts to cause the registration
statement to become effective within ninety (90) days after
the merger. After the registration statement becomes effective,
the common stock issued to the investors and issuable upon
exercise of the warrants would be freely tradable in the public
market. However, the warrants would not be exercisable for six
months after the closing.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements give effect to the acquisition by
Superconductor of Conductus using the purchase method of

of Conductus.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet as of September 28, 2002, assumes
that the acquisition and financing were consummated on
September 28, 2002, and the following unaudited pro forma

December 31, 2001 and for the nine months ended
September 28, 2002 assume that the acquisition and
financing were consummated on January 1, 2001.

The acquisition will be accounted for as a
purchase, with the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
being recorded at estimated fair value. The adjustments included
in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements represent the Companys preliminary
determination of the purchase price allocation based upon
available information and there can be no assurance that the
actual adjustments will not differ significantly from the pro
forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial
information.

financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
results that would have occurred if the acquisition and
financing had been consummated as of the indicated dates or that
may occur in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed

(dollars in thousands)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the
stockholders of Conductus will receive 0.6 shares of newly
issued common stock of Superconductor for each share of
Conductus stock. In addition, Superconductor will assume all
outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of Conductus
common stock as adjusted for the exchange ratio.

In addition, several institutional investors have
committed to invest an additional $20 million in
Superconductor upon consummation of the merger in exchange for
unregistered common stock and warrants to purchase common stock.
The financing transaction and the merger are conditioned on the
other.

Superconductor estimates the purchase price to be
approximately $18,289, which is comprised of the
13,511,621 shares to be issued of $15,268, the estimated
fair value of options assumed of $930, the estimated fair value
of warrants assumed of $890, and Superconductors estimated
costs to complete the acquisition of $1,201.

Superconductor has engaged a third party
valuation group to perform a valuation in order to allocate the
purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
Business Combinations. This valuation is in process
and the pro forma adjustments included herein related to the
tangible and intangible assets to be acquired may change based
on the results of the valuation. Subject to the final analysis,
the purchase price has been allocated as follows based upon
managements best estimate of the tangible and intangible
assets to be acquired.

SUPERCONDUCTOR MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION
AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with Superconductor Selected
Historical Financial Data and the financial statements and
notes thereto contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/
prospectus. The discussion in the proxy statement/ prospectus
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. The cautionary statements made in this proxy
statement/ prospectus should be read as being applicable to all
related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this
proxy statement/ prospectus. Actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include
those discussed in Risk Factors and Business
of Superconductor as well as those discussed elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

General

Superconductor develops, manufactures and markets
high performance products to service providers, systems
integrators and original equipment manufacturers in the wireless
telecommunications industry. Superconductors products, known
collectively as SuperLink Solutions, maximize the performance of
wireless networks by improving the quality of uplink
signals from subscriber terminals (wireless handsets or mobile
wireless devices) to network base stations and of
downlink signals from network base stations to
subscriber terminals. These premium products work in concert to
provide Total Link Enhancement, a combination of complimentary
wireless products built around their flagship SuperFilter System
to meet the growing demand of the wireless telecommunications
industry for improved capacity, reduced interference, and
greater coverage for their network base stations.

SuperLink Solutions consist of three unique
product families: SuperLink Rx Solutions, SuperLink Tx Solutions
and SuperPlex Solutions. Together, these solutions allow service
providers to benefit from lower capital and operating costs.
They also increase the minutes of use because subscribers
experience better call quality, fewer dropped calls and higher
speed data transmissions.

1.     
SuperLink
Rx Solutions.
 In order to receive
uplink signals from wireless terminals, base stations require a
wireless filter system to eliminate, or filter out, out-of-band
interference. To address this need, Superconductor offers
SuperLink Rx Solutions, which includes its flagship product, the
SuperFilter System. Deployed in base stations, these solutions
combine specialized filters using high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) technology with a proprietary cryogenic
cooler and a low-noise amplifier. The result is a highly compact
and reliable cryogenic receiver front-end that can
simultaneously deliver both high selectivity (interference
rejection) and high sensitivity (detection of low level
signals). SuperLink Rx Solutions thereby offers significant
advantages over conventional filter systems.

2.     
SuperLink
Tx Solutions.
 Many wireless networks
also suffer from insufficient transmit power on the downlink
signal path. In this situation, operators benefit from its
SuperLink Tx Solutions, a family of compact, robust, and
technologically-advanced high-power amplifiers.

3.     
SuperPlex
Solutions.
 For superior antenna
multiplexing functionality, Superconductor offers SuperPlex
Solutions, a line of multiplexers that provide extremely low
insertion loss and excellent cross-band isolation.

From 1987 to 1997, Superconductor was engaged
primarily in research and development and generated revenues
primarily from government research contracts. Superconductor
began full-scale commercial production of the SuperFilter in
1997 and shipped 438 units in 2001 and 706 units in the first
nine months of 2002. As Superconductor continues to focus on its
commercial products, commercial revenues are expected to
increase as a percentage of revenues. Superconductor has
incurred cumulative losses of $101 million from inception
to September 28, 2002.

Critical Accounting Policies

Superconductors discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and results of operations are based upon
its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally



accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements requires Superconductor to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going
basis, Superconductor evaluates its estimates, including those
related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty obligations, contingencies and its loss contract
with U.S. Cellular. Superconductor bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that
Superconductor believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Superconductor believes the following critical
accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Superconductor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
to make required payments. If the financial condition of its
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required. Superconductor writes down its inventory for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference
between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value
based upon assumptions about future demands and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than
those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs
may be required.

Superconductors net sales consist of
revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and
allowances. Superconductor recognizes revenue when evidence of
an arrangement exists, contractual obligations have been
satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the
customer and collection of the resulting receivable is
reasonably assured. At the time revenue is recognized,
Superconductor provides for the estimated cost of product
warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements. Its
warranty obligation is effected by product failure rates and
service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
Should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates,
accrued warranty costs would be adjusted.

As described in Note 8 to the
December 31, 2001 financial statements, in September 2000
Superconductor received a $7.8 million non-cancelable
purchase order from U.S. Cellular for SuperFilter systems
to be shipped over the next nine quarters. In consideration for
the purchase order, Superconductor amended the August 1999
warrant agreement and vested 312,000 warrants to
U.S. Cellular.

After the allocation of sales proceeds to the
related warrants, the estimated cost of providing products under
the purchase order exceeded related revenue by
$5.3 million. The resulting loss was reflected in the
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000
and a loss reserve established. Through December 31, 2001
and September 28, 2002, an aggregate of $3,302,000 and
$4,612,000, respectively, of this reserve was reversed against
the cost of product delivered under this purchase order. The
reserve is based on estimated future product costs and should
these future costs differ from those estimated this reserve will
be adjusted.

Contract revenues are principally generated under
research and development contracts. Contract revenues are
recognized utilizing the percentage-of-completion method
measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total
estimated contract costs. If the current contract estimate were
to indicate a loss, utilizing the funded amount of the contract,
a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss.
Revenues from research related activities are derived primarily
from contracts with agencies of the United States Government.
Credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such
contracts is considered minimal. These contracts include
cost-plus, fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are
generally short-term in nature.

All payments to Superconductor for work performed
on contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government are
subject to adjustment upon audit by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency. Based on historical experience and review of current
projects in process, management believes that the audits will
not have a significant effect on the financial position, results
of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Superconductors valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets is based on its assessment of historical
losses and projected operating results in future periods. If and
when Superconductor generates future



taxable income in the U.S. against which these
tax assets may be applied, some portion or all of the valuation
allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would
consequently be reported in future years.

Superconductor is currently engaged in a patent
dispute with ISCO International, Inc. Superconductor has not
recorded any liability relating to this litigation but may be
required to do so if Superconductor is unsuccessful in defending
itself.

Backlog

Superconductors backlog consists of
accepted commercial product purchase orders scheduled for
delivery within 24 months and includes purchase orders
denominated in either dollar amounts or a specified number of
units. For purposes of calculating backlog, Superconductor
estimates a dollar amount for unit commitments based on past
purchasing patterns and expected purchasing trends.
Superconductor estimates its backlog at September 28, 2002
was approximately $6.7 million, as compared to
$21.3 million at December 31, 2001. Superconductor
expects that this backlog will be delivered by the end of the
first quarter of 2003. The backlog also includes
$1.1 million and $3.1 million at September 28,
2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, remaining under a
$7.8 million purchase order from U.S. Cellular that will be
delivered by December 31, 2002. The subsection entitled
Non-Cash Charges For Warrants Issued to U.S.
Cellular includes a discussion of the accounting for this
purchase order.

Results of Operations

Quarter and Nine Months ended
    September 28, 2002 as Compared with Quarter and Nine Months
    ended September 29, 2001

Total net revenue increased by $2.6 million,
or more than 100%, from $2.1 million in third quarter of 2001 to
$4.7 million in the third quarter of 2002. Total net
revenues increased by $6.3 million, or more than 68%, from
$9.2 million in the first nine months of 2001 to
$15.4 million in the same period this year. The increase is
primarily due to higher commercial product sales, partially
offset by lower government revenues.

Superconductors commercial revenue is
generated from (i) the sales of its SuperFilter product
line which combines specialized superconducting RF filters with
a proprietary cryogenic cooler (and, in most cases, a low noise
amplifier) in highly compact systems and(ii) starting in
February 2001, from the sales of our new multiplexer product
line. Net commercial product revenue consists of gross
commercial product sales proceeds less sales discounts and the
allocation of certain sales proceeds to a warrant issued to one
customer in 1999 under a long-term supply agreement. For a
discussion of the allocation to warrants, please read the
discussion under the caption Non-Cash Charges for Warrants
Issued To U.S. Cellular. The following table summarizes
the calculation of net commercial product revenue for 2002 and
2001:

Net commercial product revenues in the third
quarter of 2002 increased to $4.3 million from
$1.2 million in the same period last year, an increase of
$3.1 million, or more than 100%. For the first nine months
of 2002, net commercial product revenues increased to
$13.3 million from $5.8 million in the same period of
last year, an increase of $7.5 million, or more than 100%.
This increase is the result of higher sales of the SuperFilter
products, a shift in the product mix toward higher-priced
SIX-Pak units and sales of our new duplexer product introduced
in 2001, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
Multiplexer sales in the third quarter and first nine months of
2002 totaled $277,000 and $1.8 million, respectively as
compared to $123,000 and $604,000, respectively in the same
periods in 2001. The increase in gross commercial product sales
proceeds



was partially offset by $549,000 and $460,000 in
the third quarter of 2001 and in 2002, respectively, and by
$1.9 million and $1.5 million in the first nine months
2001 and 2002, respectively, to reflect an allocation of sales
proceeds to warrants issued to U.S. Cellular in connection with
those sales. Our two largest customers accounted for 94% of the
net commercial revenues in 2002 and 89% in 2001.

Government contract revenues decreased by
$526,000, or 55%, from $955,000 in the third quarter of 2001 to
$429,000 in the same quarter of 2002. For the first nine months
of 2002, government contract revenues decreased to $2.1 million
from $3.4 million in the same period last year, a decrease
of $1.3 million, or 37%. These decreases result primarily from a
delay in the award of a government contract and to a lesser
extent a lower negotiated cost reimbursement rate charged in
2002 as compared to 2001. This delayed contract was subsequently
awarded to us in October 2002.

Cost of commercial product revenue includes all
direct costs, manufacturing overhead and related start-up costs.
The cost of commercial product revenues totaled
$4.7 million and $15.1 million for the third quarter
and first nine months of 2002, respectively, and was reduced by
amortization credits of $397,000 and $1.3 million,
respectively, relating to the accrual for non-cash contract loss
on the purchase order from U.S. Cellular. The cost of commercial
product revenues totaled $2.2 million and $7.7 million
for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001,
respectively, and was reduced by amortization credits of
$516,000 and $1.8 million, respectively, relating to the accrual
for non-cash contract loss on the purchase order from U.S.
Cellular. Please read the subsection below entitled
Non-Cash Charges for Warrants Issued To U.S.
Cellular. Excluding these amortization credits relating to
the supply agreement with U.S. Cellular, cost of commercial
revenues increased to $5.1 million in third quarter of
2002, or 87%, from $2.7 million in same period in 2001. For
the first nine months of 2002, excluding these amortization
credits, the cost of commercial revenues totaled
$16.4 million as compared to $9.6 million in the first
nine months of 2001. These increases result from increased unit
shipments and higher costs associated with ramping up the
Companys manufacturing capacity, partially offset by lower
material and labor costs per unit and the effect of increased
manufacturing efficiencies.

Superconductor generates negative gross margins
on its commercial products at current sales levels primarily due
to fixed manufacturing overhead costs. Based on current prices
and forecasted product mix and costs, Superconductor expects to
achieve positive commercial gross margins in the fourth quarter
of 2002, or depending on revenue levels, in the first quarter of
2003.

Contract research and development expenses
totaled $316,000 and $658,000 in the third quarter of 2002 and
2001, respectively. In the first nine months of 2002 and 2001,
these expenses totaled $1.5 million and $2.4 million,
respectively. These decreases result from the delay in the award
of a government contract.

Other research and development expenses relate to
development of our commercial products. These expenses increased
to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2002, as compared
to $987,000 in the same period last year. In the first nine
months of 2002, these expenses totaled $4.0 million, as
compared to $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2001.
These increases are due to a higher level of commercial
development efforts.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
totaled $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2002, which is
comparable to $3.2 million in the same period in the prior
year. In the first nine months of 2002 these expenses totaled
$11.6 million as compared to $8.5 million in the first
nine months of 2001. This increase results primarily from
increased domestic and international marketing and sales efforts
and ISCO litigation expenses. ISCO litigation expenses totaled
$674,000 and $2.5 million for the third quarter and first
nine months of 2002 respectively, as compared to $506,000 in the
same periods last year.

Interest income decreased in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2002 as compared to the same periods in
the prior year due to decreased levels of cash available for
investment and the decline in interest rates.

Interest expense decreased in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2002 as compared to the same periods in
the prior year and resulted from decreased borrowings in the
current year.



Superconductor had a net loss of $4.8 for the
current quarter ended September 28, 2002, which is
comparable to the loss in the same period in the prior year. For
the first nine months of 2002, the net loss totaled
$16.6 million as compared to $12.2 million last year.

The net loss available to common shareholders
totaled $5.4 million in the current quarter, or $0.23 per
common share, as compared to $5.5 million, or $0.30 per
common share, in the same period last year. The amounts for the
third quarter of 2002 and 2001 include a $570,000 and $655,000,
respectively, non-cash deemed distribution on preferred stock.
The net loss available to common shareholders totaled
$18.3 million in the first nine months of 2002, or $0.85
per common share, as compared to $14.2 million, or $0.79
per common share, in the same period last year. The amounts for
the first nine months of 2002 and 2001 include a
$1.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, non-cash
deemed distribution on preferred stock.

     2001 as
Compared to 2000

Total net revenues increased by
$2.4 million, or 24%, from $10.0 million in 2000 to
$12.4 million in 2001. The increase is primarily due to
higher commercial product sales.

Superconductors commercial revenues are
generated from (i) the sales of its SuperFilter product
line which combines specialized superconducting RF filters with
a proprietary cryogenic cooler (and, in most cases, a low noise
amplifier) in highly compact systems and (ii) starting in
February 2001, from the sales of its new multiplexer product
line. Superconductor also introduced its multi-carrier power
amplifier product in March 2001, but it has not yet contributed
significantly to its revenues. Net commercial product revenues
consist of gross commercial product sales proceeds less sales
discounts and the allocation of certain sales proceeds to a
warrant issued to one customer in 1999 under a long-term supply
agreement. For a discussion of the allocation to warrants,
please read the discussion under the caption Non-Cash
Charges for Warrants Issued To U.S. Cellular. The
following table summarizes the calculation of net commercial
product revenues for 2000 and 2001:

$

7,601

Net commercial product revenues in 2001 increased
to $7.6 million from $5.3 million in the same period
last year, an increase of $2.3 million, or 43%. This
increase is the result of higher sales of Superconductors
SuperFilter products, a shift in the product mix toward
higher-priced SIX-Pak units and sales of its new duplexer
product introduced in 2001. Multiplexer sales in 2001 totaled
$635,000. The increase in gross commercial product sales
proceeds was partially offset by $2.2 million in 2001 and
$2.3 million in 2000 to reflect an allocation of sales
proceeds to warrants issued to U.S. Cellular in connection with
those sales. Its two largest customers accounted for 85% of its
net commercial revenues in 2001 as compared to 49% in 2000.

In 2001, government contract revenue totaled
$4.8 million as compared to $4.6 million last year.
These revenues included government subcontract revenue which
totaled $1.4 million in 2001 as compared to $689,000 in
2000. Excluding the impact of subcontract revenues, government
contract revenues declined this last year as Superconductor
focused more of its research and development resources on its
commercial business. Superconductor plans to focus its future
government contract work on projects that have applications to
its commercial product business and expect government revenues
to increase slightly in the future.

Cost of commercial product revenues includes all
direct costs, manufacturing overhead and related start-up costs.
The cost of commercial product revenues totaled
$10.6 million for 2001 and was reduced by the amortization
of $2.2 million, relating to the accrual for non-cash
contract loss on the purchase order received from
U.S. Cellular. The cost of commercial product revenues was
$15.7 million for 2000 and included an



accrued non cash loss of $4.2 million
relating to the purchase order received from U.S. Cellular
and other non-cash warrant charges relating to
U.S. Cellular of $482,000. Please read the subsection below
entitled Non-Cash Charges for Warrants Issued To U.S.
Cellular. Excluding these non-cash charges and credits
relating to the supply agreement with U.S. Cellular, cost
of commercial revenues increased to $12.9 million in 2001,
or 17%, from $11.0 million in 2000. This increase was the
result of increased unit shipments and higher costs associated
with ramping up the Companys manufacturing capacity,
partially offset by lower material and labor costs per unit and
the effect of increased manufacturing efficiencies.

Superconductor generates negative gross margins
on its commercial products at current sales levels primarily due
to fixed manufacturing overhead costs.

Contract research and development expenses
totaled $3.4 million in 2001 as compared to
$4.2 million in the prior year and included subcontract
expenses of $1.4 million and $689,000, respectively.
Excluding subcontract expenses, contract research and
development expenses decreased to $2.0 million in 2001, as
compared to $3.5 million last year. This decrease results
from the increased focus on commercial research efforts.

Other research and development expenses relate to
development of Superconductors commercial products. These
expenses totaled $4.6 million in 2001, as compared to
$2.6 million in 2000. This increase is due to increased
spending on product line expansion, further development of the
SuperFilter product line, including product pilots, and product
line cost reduction efforts.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
totaled $11.9 million in 2001 as compared to
$8.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of
$3.6 million, or 42%. This increase results primarily from
increased corporate development, domestic and international
marketing and sales efforts, management recruitment activities,
insurance premiums and ISCO litigation expenses. ISCO litigation
expenses totaled $976,000 for the last six months in 2001 and
are expected to increase throughout 2002 as Superconductor
approaches the trial which is scheduled for January 2003.

Interest income increased to $1.1 million in
2001 as compared to $806,000, in the prior year, due to higher
levels of cash available for investment.

Interest expense decreased by $337,000 to
$146,000 in 2001 as compared to $483,000 in the prior year and
resulted from decreased borrowings in the current year.

Superconductor had a net loss of
$17.2 million in 2001, as compared to $20.7 million in
2001.

The net loss available to common shareholders
totaled $19.8 million in 2001, or $1.10 per common share,
as compared to $33.5 million, or $2.09 per common share, in
the same period last year. The amounts for 2001 include a
$2.6 million non-cash deemed distribution on preferred
stock. The amounts for 2000 included $10.6 million for the
non-cash cumulative effect of an accounting change and
$2.2 million of non-cash deemed dividends on preferred
stock.

2000 as Compared with 1999

Net revenues increased by $2.9 million, or
40%, from $7.1 million in 1999 to $10.0 million in
2000. The increase is due to higher commercial product revenues,
partially offset by lower government contract revenues.

Net commercial product revenues consist of gross
commercial product sales proceeds less discounts and an
allocation of proceeds to a warrant issued to one customer in
1999 under a long-term supply agreement. For a discussion of the
allocation to warrants, please read the discussion under the

$

5,303

Net commercial product revenues increased by
$3.2 million, or 158%, from $2.1 million in 1999 to
$5.3 million in 2000. This increase is the result of
increased sales of Superconductors SuperFilter products
and a shift in the product mix toward higher-priced SIX-Pak
units. The increase in gross commercial product sales proceeds
was partially offset by $2.3 million in 2000 and $124,000
in 1999 to reflect an allocation of sales proceeds to warrants
issued to U.S. Cellular in connection with those sales. The
warrant charges increased because of growing product shipments
to U.S. Cellular and a dramatic increase in
Superconductors stock price during 2000.
Superconductors two largest customers accounted for 49% of
its net commercial revenues in 2001 as compared to 69% in 2000.

Government contract revenues decreased by
$416,000, or 8%, from $5.1 million in 1999 to $4.6 million
in 2000. Superconductor expects government contract revenues to
decline as Superconductor focuses more of its research and
development resources on its commercial business.

Cost of commercial product revenues includes all
direct costs, manufacturing overhead and related start-up costs.
The cost of commercial product revenues was $15.7 million
for 2000, including an accrued non-cash loss of
$4.2 million relating to the purchase order received from
U.S. Cellular and other non-cash warrant charges relating
to U.S. Cellular of $482,000. Please read the subsection
below entitled Non-Cash Charges for Warrants Issued To
U.S. Cellular. Excluding the non-cash charges
relating to the supply agreement with U.S. Cellular, cost
of commercial revenues increased $4.1 million, or over 60%,
from $6.9 million for 1999. This increase results from
increased units shipments and higher costs associated with
ramping up the Companys manufacturing abilities, partially
offset by lower material costs and the effect of increased
manufacturing efficiencies.

Superconductor generates negative gross margins
on its SuperFilter products at current sales levels primarily
due to fixed manufacturing overhead costs.

Contract research and development expenses
increased by $808,000, or 24%, from $3.4 million in 1999 to
$4.2 million in 2000. Contract research and development
expenses as a percentage of related revenues totaled 91% for
2000, as compared with 68% last year. The percentage increase is
due to higher expenses associated with a completed contract, the
effect of spreading fixed expenses over a lower revenue base and
the increased use of subcontractors.

Other research and development expenses increased
by $886,000, or 51%, from $1.7 million in 1999 to
$2.6 million in 2000. This increase is due to increased
spending on product line expansion, further development of the
SuperFilter product line and product cost reduction efforts.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased by $2.7 million, or 48%, from $5.7 million
in fiscal 1999 to $8.4 million in fiscal 2000. This
increase results primarily from increased corporate development,
domestic and international marketing and sales efforts,
management recruitment activities, occupancy expenses, the
implementation of a management incentive program, liability
insurance premiums and expenses associated with distributing
annual meeting information to a larger shareholder base.

Interest income increased to $806,000 in 2000, as
compared to $21,000 in the prior year, due to higher levels of
cash available for investment.



Interest expense increased by $151,000, or 45%,
from $332,000 in 1999 to $483,000 in 2000 and resulted from new
financing agreements in 1999 and 2000.

Superconductor had a net loss of
$20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, as
compared to $10.9 million for the prior year.

The net loss available to common shareholders of
$33.5 million, or $2.09 per share, for 2000 included
$10.6 million for the non-cash cumulative effect of an
accounting change and $2.2 million of non-cash deemed
dividends on preferred stock. The net loss available to common
shareholders of $12.2 million, or $1.58 per share, for 1999
included $1.4 million for non-cash dividends and other
deemed distributions to preferred stockholders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Nine Months ended September 28,

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by
$7.1 million from $15.2 million at December 31,
2001 to $8.1 million at September 28, 2002. Cash used
in operations and investing activities during the first nine
months of 2002 was partially offset by cash received from the
sale of common stock and warrants in a private placement during
the first quarter.

Cash used in operations totaled
$13.9 million in the first nine months of 2002.
Superconductor used $15.0 million to fund the cash portion
of Superconductors net losses. Superconductor also used
cash to fund a $1.6 million increase in accounts receivable,
inventory, patents and licenses and other assets. Cash generated
from the increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses
totaled $2.7 million. Cash used in operations in the first
nine months of 2001 totaled $10.8 million and was used
primarily to fund operating losses of $10.7 million net of
non-cash adjustments and $3.7 million for the increase in
inventory, prepaid assets, patents and licenses and other
assets. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in
accounts receivable of $2.5 million.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$5.2 million in the first nine months of 2002 and
$1.4 million the same period last year and primarily
related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$12.0 million in the first nine months of 2002. Cash
received from the sale of common stock and warrants and exercise
of stock options totaled $12.2 million and was partially
offset by the net reduction in borrowings of $220,000. In the
same period of 2001, cash provided by financing operations
totaled $64,000 and resulted from the exercise of stock options
which totaled $242,000 and was partially offset by the net
reduction in borrowings of $178,000.

Superconductor had a revolving line of credit
that matured unused on July 20, 2002. Superconductor is in
discussions with other lenders to replace this credit facility.

In March 2002 Superconductor raised net proceeds
of $12.2 million from the private sale of 3,714,286 shares
of common stock at $3.50 per share and 5-year warrants to
purchase an additional 557,143 shares of common stock at $5.50
per share. The common stock was priced on February 27, 2002
when the term sheet was signed, and the Companys common
stock closed at $4.02 per share on that date. The underlying
warrants were priced on March 6, 2002 when the definitive
purchase agreement was signed, and the Companys common
stock closed at $4.45 per share on that date. In conjunction
with this equity issuance, Superconductor also issued to the
placement agent 5-year warrants to purchase up to 213,571 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.

Pursuant to the transaction documents,
Superconductor filed a registration statement covering the
shares of common stock issued at the closing and upon exercise
of the warrants. The registration statement became effective on
April 5, 2002.



At September 28, 2002, Superconductor had

Superconductor implemented a cost reduction
program early in the third quarter in response to
slower-than-expected growth in Superconductor commercial product
sales. Superconductor reduced the size of its workforce by
approximately 11%, implemented a 10% salary reduction for senior
management and eliminated bonuses for senior management.
Superconductor also adjusted their facility expansion plans from
an original goal of 600 systems per quarter to approximately 300
systems per quarter. Superconductor plans to invest an
additional $1.5 to $2.0 million during the remainder of
2002 (including $849,000 million of existing cash
commitments reflected above in the table) primarily to improve
manufacturing efficiency. Superconductor believes the
manufacturing capacity is easily expandable to 600 systems per
quarter with an additional investment of $2.0 to
$2.5 million.

Superconductor has continued to incur losses
through September 2002 and expect to incur losses for the
remainder of the year, although at a decreasing rate.
Superconductors long-term prospects are dependent upon the
continued and increased market acceptance for Superconductor
products.

At September 28, 2002 Superconductor had
cash resources on hand of $8.1 million.

The Companys future capital requirements
depend generally on future levels of revenues and spending. On
September 30, 2002 Superconductor converted the remainder
of Superconductor Series E Convertible Preferred Stock into
2,155,261 common shares in accordance with the terms of the
Series E Certificate of Designation. The associated
conversion premium was paid with $3.0 million in cash and a
$1.7 subordinated note. The subordinated note carries eight
percent interest with interest only payable for the first six
months and monthly amortization of principal and interest for
the remaining twelve months.

Superconductor executed two significant
agreements dated October 10, 2002 affecting
Superconductors future liquidity. Superconductor signed a
definitive agreement to merge with Conductus, Inc., and
Superconductor signed a Securities Purchase Agreement with
several investors for a $20 million private equity
financing. Please see the discussion. With the completion of the
merger with Conductus and the related financing, Superconductor
believes that the combined entity will have sufficient cash
resources to fund the combined operations of the two companies
well into 2004.

Superconductor believes that the merger
transaction contemplated between Superconductor and Conductus
will close by the end of the December 2002. If the close of the
merger is delayed beyond the end of December 2002,
Superconductor believe that its cash balances should be
sufficient to fund operations into the first half of 2003,
however, there can be no assurance that changes in
Superconductor plans or events will not result in the
expenditure of its resources before then. If the merger
transaction is delayed significantly or is not completed at all,
Superconductor will be required to seek additional financing,
however Superconductor cannot give assurance that additional
financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
Should the merger and financing not be completed it would have a
material adverse effect on Superconductors business and
operating results.



Non-Cash Charges For Warrants Issued To U.S.
Cellular

In August 1999, the Company entered into a
warrant agreement with United States Cellular Corporation
(U.S. Cellular) where the exercise of a warrant to
purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock was conditioned
upon future product purchases by U.S. Cellular. Under the terms
of the warrant, U.S. Cellular vests in the right to purchase one
share of common stock at $4 per share for every $25 of
SuperFilter systems purchased from the Company. The warrant is
immediately exercisable with respect to any vested shares and
expires August 27, 2004. For accounting purposes proceeds
from sales to U.S. Cellular under this agreement were initially
allocated between commercial product revenues and the estimated
value of the warrants vesting in connection with those sales.
The estimated fair value of the warrants in excess of the
related sales, when applicable, is recorded in cost of
commercial product revenues.

In September 2000, the Company received a
$7.8 million non-cancelable purchase order from U.S.
Cellular for SuperFilter systems to be shipped over the next
nine quarters. In consideration for the purchase order, the
Company amended the August 1999 warrant agreement and vested
312,000 warrants to U.S. Cellular. The vested warrants are
immediately exercisable, not subject to forfeiture, and U.S.
Cellular has no other obligations to the Company.

The estimated fair value of the warrants vesting
upon receipt of this order was calculated to be $5,635,000 using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was recorded as a
deferred warrant charge in the statement of stockholders
equity. As SuperFilter systems are shipped under this purchase
order, the related sales proceeds are allocated between
stockholders equity and commercial product revenue using
the percentage relationship which existed between the fair value
of the warrants as recorded in September 2000 and the amount of
the non-cancelable purchase order. The fair value of the
warrants was calculated utilizing a volatility factor of 85%,
risk-free interest rate of 6.01%, and an expected life of
3.92 years. During the three and nine months ended
September 28, 2002 sales proceeds of $460,000 and
$1,484,000, respectively, for shipments pursuant to this
purchase order were allocated to the deferred warrant charge and
proceeds of $170,000 and $557,000, respectively, were recorded
as commercial product revenues During the three and nine months
ended September 29, 2001 sales proceeds of $549,000 and
$1,938,000, respectively, for shipments pursuant to this
purchase order were allocated to the deferred warrant charge and
proceeds of $210,000 and $744,000, respectively, were recorded
as commercial product revenues.

In September 2000, after the allocation of the
future sales proceeds to the fair value of the related warrants,
the estimated cost of providing products under the purchase
order exceeded related revenue by $5.3 million. The
resulting loss was reflected in the results of operations for
the quarter ended September 30, 2000. During the three and
nine months ended September 28, 2002, $397,000 and
$1,310,000, respectively, of this reserve was amortized against
the cost of product delivered under this purchase order. During
the three and nine months ended September 29, 2001,
$516,000 and $1,823,000, respectively of this reserve was
amortized against the cost of product delivered under this
purchase order.

As of September 28, 2002 U.S. Cellular has
585,560 unvested warrants that can be earned from future product
orders through August 27, 2004. In each period in which
these remaining warrants are earned, a non-cash charge will be
recorded for the fair market value of the warrants shares earned
or vested in the period.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by
approximately $16.6 million from $31.8 million on
December 31, 2000 to $15.2 million on
December 31, 2001. The decrease results from cash used in
operations and investing activities.

Cash used in operations totaled
$14.7 million in 2001. Superconductor used
$15.1 million to fund the cash portion of its net losses.
Superconductor also used cash to fund a $2.0 million
increase in inventory. Cash generated from the decrease in
accounts receivable totaled $2.2 million. Cash used in
operations in 2000 totaled $14.5 million and was used
primarily to fund operating losses of $11.8 million net of
non-cash adjustments, $2.1 million for the increase in
accounts receivable and $1.0 million for the increase in
inventory.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$1.9 million in 2001 and $2.2 million in 2000 and
related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment.



Net cash used by financing activities totaled
$24,000 in 2001. Cash received from the exercise of outstanding
stock options totaled $218,000 and was offset by the net
reduction in borrowings of $242,000. In the same period of 2000,
cash provided by financing operations totaled $48.4 million
and primarily resulted from issuance of convertible preferred
shares and warrants and the exercise of stock options and
warrants, partially offset by payments on borrowings.

Superconductor also had a revolving line of
credit available that matures on June 20, 2002. The line of
credit cannot exceed the lesser of (i) $2.5 million or
(ii) 80% of eligible accounts receivable. The line of
credit bears interest at prime rate (4.75% at December 31,
2001) plus 1%, requires that certain financial and business
covenants be maintained and is collateralized by substantially
all of the Companys assets. Upon maturity, Superconductor
plans on replacing this facility with one from a new institution.

On March 11, 2002 Superconductor had binding
commitments totaling $13.0 million in a new equity private
placement. The transaction is expected to generate net proceeds
of $12.4 million. The Company closed commitments totaling
$11.2 million on March 12, 2002 and expects to close
the remaining commitment for $1.8 million pending a
response to its request for guidance from Nasdaq. The Company
may decline to accept the additional investment if Nasdaq
concludes that shareholder approval is required. In that event,
the net proceeds of the transaction would be $10.6 million.

If the remaining commitment is accepted, the
Company will have issued a total of 3,714,286 shares of common
stock at $3.50 per share and 5-year warrants to purchase an
additional 557,143 shares of the common stock at $5.50 per
share. The common stock was priced on February 27, 2002
when the term sheet was signed, and the Companys common
stock closed at $4.02 per share on that date. The
underlying warrants were priced on March 6, 2002 when the
definitive purchase agreement was signed, and the Companys
common stock closed at $4.45 per share on that date.

The securities sold in this private placement
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and
may not be offered or sold in the United States in the absence
of an effective registration statement or exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company has
agreed to file a registration statement by April 11, 2001
covering the shares of common stock issued at the closing and
upon exercise of the warrants.

For the Year Ended December 31,

Cash and cash equivalents increased by
approximately $31.8 million from $66,000 on
December 31, 1999 to $31.8 million on
December 31, 2000. The increase results from the cash
received from private placements of convertible preferred stock
and related warrants and common stock to institutional investors
and the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and
stock options. These amounts were partially offset by cash used
in operations and investing activities and the pay down of the
line of credit.

Cash used in operations totaled
$14.5 million in 2000. Superconductor used
$11.8 million to fund the cash portion of our net losses.
Superconductor also used cash to fund a $2.1 million increase in
accounts receivable and a $1.0 million increase in
inventory. Cash used in operations in 1999 totaled
$9.7 million and was used primarily to fund operating
losses of $9.2 million net of non-cash adjustments.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$2.2 million in fiscal 2000 and related to the purchase of
manufacturing equipment. Net cash provided by investing
activities totaled $285,000 in fiscal 1999 and resulted from the
purchase of equipment offset by the proceeds of $900,000 from
the sale and leaseback of certain production equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$48.4 million in fiscal 2000. Cash received from private
sales of common stock and preferred stock, as well as from the
exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, totaled
$50.1 million and was partially offset by the net reduction in
borrowings of $1.7 million. In the same period of 1999, cash
provided by financing operations totaled $9.2 million and
primarily resulted from private sales of preferred stock and
short term borrowings, partially offset by payments due on
long-term obligations.



On September 29, 2000, Superconductor raised
net proceeds of $35.1 million from the private sale of
37,500 shares of a newly created Series E Convertible
Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional
1,044,568 shares of common stock.

The preferred stock is non-voting, has a stated
value and liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and is
convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of
$17.95 per common share until June 29, 2001. After that
date, the preferred stock is convertible at the lower of $17.95
per common share or the market price of the common stock at the
time of conversion, subject to a floor. The preferred stock
automatically converts into common stock on the second
anniversary of the closing. Based on the current conversion
price of $17.95 per common share, the preferred stock is
convertible into 2,089,136 shares of common stock. The optional
and automatic conversions of preferred stock are limited to an
aggregate maximum of 3,554,656 shares of common stock. The
preferred stock carries a 7% conversion premium, payable upon
conversion in cash or common stock subject to certain
limitations, at Superconductors option.

In connection with the sale of the preferred
stock, Superconductor also issued two five-year warrants to
purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $21.54
per share. The first warrant is for the purchase of 313,370
shares and is exercisable immediately. The second warrant is for
the purchase of up to 731,198 additional shares of common stock
if the preferred stock is held for at least one year. The
warrant is not exercisable until the first anniversary date and
size of the warrant will be reduced proportionately to reflect
any conversions of the preferred stock prior to the first
anniversary date. Both warrants contain weighted
average antidilution provisions which adjust the warrant
exercise price and the number of shares issuable under the
warrant in the event Superconductor sells equity securities at a
discount to then prevailing market prices. The amount of the
adjustment depends on the size of the below-market transaction
and the amount of the discount to the market price. The warrant
exercise price cannot be reduced below a minimum of $18.91 as
the result of adjustments under this provision.

During fiscal 2000, the holders of the
Series A-2, A-3, B-1, C and D Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Stock converted their holdings into 5,633,901 shares
of common stock. As an inducement to convert their preferred
shares into common stock, Superconductor issued the
Series A-2, A-3 and C preferred stockholders warrants to
purchase 250,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of these
warrants is considered a deemed distribution to the preferred
stockholders and, therefore, the fair market value of the
warrants of $1.5 million is considered in the computation
of the net loss per share.

Net Operating Loss Carryforward

At December 31, 2001, Superconductor had
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$85.6 million. Under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the percentage of stock (by
value) of a loss corporation that is owned by one or more
5-percent shareholders has increased by more than 50-percentage
points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by the same
shareholders during a three year testing period (an
ownership change), the use of pre-ownership change
net operating losses of the loss corporation following such
ownership change will be limited based on the value of the loss
corporation immediately before the ownership change (a
Section 382 Limitation). Generally, the annual
Section 382 Limitation that applies is determined by
multiplying the value of the loss corporations stock by a
rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. If a
corporation cannot use its entire Section 382 Limitation in
a given taxable year (
e.g., 
because it has insufficient
taxable income), the unused portion is carried forward and added
to the Section 382 Limitation that applies for the
following year.

Superconductor had an ownership change for
purposes of Section 382 in 1999. This event limits the
ability of Superconductor to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards incurred through the date of the ownership change
(totaling $32.6 million) to an annual Section 382
Limitation of $2.3 million. Net operating losses incurred
subsequent to the ownership change totaled $53.0 million
and are not presently subject to any limitation under
Section 382. However, it is likely that the consummation of
the merger and contemporaneous offering will cause
Superconductor to have another ownership change for purposes of
Section 382 that further restricts the future utilization of
Superconductors net operating loss carryforwards incurred
through the



ownership change date. If such an ownership
change occurs, the applicable Section 382 Limitation will
be significantly lower than the $2.3 million limitation
that resulted from the 1999 ownership change.

Market Risk

Superconductor is exposed to various market
risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk is the
potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices. Superconductor does not enter into derivatives of other
financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes.

At December 31, 2001, Superconductor had
approximately $15 million invested in a money market
account yielding approximately 2.01%. Assuming a 1% decrease in
the yield on this money market account and no liquidation of
principal for the year, Superconductors total interest
income would decrease by $150,000 per annum.

At September 28, 2002, Superconductor had
not experienced a material change in its exposure to market risk
as compared with its market risk exposure on December 31,
2001.

Inflation

Superconductor does not foresee any material
impact on its operations from inflation.



BUSINESS OF SUPERCONDUCTOR

Superconductor develops, manufactures and markets
high performance products to service providers, systems
integrators and original equipment manufacturers in the wireless
telecommunications industry. Superconductors products,
known collectively as SuperLink Solutions, maximize the
performance of wireless networks by improving the quality of
uplink signals from subscriber terminals (wireless
handsets or mobile wireless devices) to network base stations
and of downlink signals from network base stations
to subscriber terminals. These premium products work in concert
to provide Total Link Enhancement
SM
, a combination of
complimentary wireless products built around
Superconductors flagship SuperFilter System to meet the
growing demand of the wireless communications industry for
improved capacity, reduced interference, and greater coverage
for network base stations.

SuperLink Solutions consist of three unique
product families: SuperLink Rx Solutions, SuperLink TX Solutions
and SuperPlex Solutions. Together, these solutions allow service
providers to benefit from lower capital and operating costs.
They also increase the minutes of use because subscribers
experience better call quality, fewer dropped calls and higher
speed data transmissions.

 

SuperLink Rx Solutions.

In order to receive uplink signals
    from wireless terminals, base stations require a wireless filter
    system to eliminate, or filter out, out-of-band interference. To
    address this need, Superconductor offers SuperLink Rx Solutions,
    which include Superconductors flagship product, the
    SuperFilter System. Deployed in base stations, these solutions
    combine specialized filters using high-temperature
    superconducting (HTS) technology with a proprietary
    cryogenic cooler and a low-noise amplifier. The result is a
    highly compact and reliable cryogenic receiver front-end that
    can simultaneously deliver both high selectivity (interference
    rejection) and high sensitivity (detection of low level
    signals). SuperLink Rx Solutions thereby offer significant
    advantages over conventional filter systems.

 

SuperLink Tx
    Solutions.
 Many wireless networks also
    suffer from insufficient transmit power on the downlink signal
    path. In this situation, operators benefit from
    Superconductors SuperLink Tx Solutions, a family of
    compact, robust, and technologically-advanced high-power
    amplifiers.

 

SuperPlex Solutions.

For superior antenna multiplexing
    functionality, Superconductor offers SuperPlex Solutions, a line
    of multiplexers that provide extremely low insertion loss and
    excellent cross-band isolation.

Superconductor was incorporated in the state of
Delaware in 1987. Its principal place of business and executive
offices are located at 460 Ward Drive, Santa Barbara,
California 93111. Superconductor has undergone three unique
phases of development since its incorporation. From 1987 to
1996, Superconductor focused primarily on the research and
development of high-temperature superconducting technologies.
From 1997 to 2001, Superconductors second phase,
Superconductor made the transition from a research and
development firm to a commercial products company. During this
time Superconductor launched Superconductors flagship
product, the SuperFilter System, and concentrated on
commercializing Superconductors technology for the
U.S. wireless market. Superconductor is now in
Superconductors third phase of development.
Superconductors Company is evolving from one oriented
solely around high-temperature superconducting technology to one
that is committed to providing best-in-class link enhancement
solutions to the wireless infrastructure market. Following
Superconductors strategy of Total Link Enhancement
(simultaneously optimizing the performance of the uplink, the
downlink and the antenna), Superconductor now offers innovative
technologies across multiple product lines and in multiple
geographic markets.

Industry Background

The Wireless Communications
    Market

Despite the recent slowdown in the
telecommunications infrastructure sector, Superconductor expects
the underlying strengths of the wireless communications market
will allow it to weather the storm and to gradually
benefit from increased but more efficient capital spending. Some
of these strengths include: continued worldwide growth in
subscribers, particularly in the developing world; rising
minutes of use; and wider availability of advanced air
interfaces that permit faster data throughput.



New Subscribers.

According to the Yankee Group, at the
end of 2000 there were approximately 625 million cellular
and PCS wireless subscribers worldwide. The Yankee Group
expects this number to increase to approximately
1.3 billion subscribers by the close of 2005, representing
a compound annual growth rate of 16%. The developing world, led
by the Peoples Republic of China, is expected to continue to
experience the fastest subscriber growth rates.

Increased Usage (Minutes of Use).

Superconductor expects that cut-rate
prices for wireless calls will lead to significant increases in
minutes of use for the average subscriber. Superconductor also
expects that higher minutes of use will likely come from the
emergence of new data and Internet services such as e-mail and
instant messaging, as well as from consumers gradual shift
toward using mobile devices instead of fixed telephones as their
primary telecommunications device.

New Air Interfaces.

Advanced wireless transmission technologies, or air
interfaces, are finally becoming available to consumers in
the United States and other nations. With their faster data
speeds and increased bandwidth, these new air interfaces are
expected to usher in a broad range of wireless services, from
music downloads to video file sharing. One such new wireless
transmission technology is CDMA IXRTT, which represents an
upgrade to the current technology known as Code Division
Multiple Access (commonly referred to as CDMA). Superconductor
expects the onset of the data era in mobile
communications will help operators to reverse declining annual
revenues per user and move closer to long-term financial health.

Strains on Wireless Networks

Superconductor believes the ability to provide
high quality service to customers will become increasingly
difficult for wireless operators as the number of subscribers
rises, minutes of use increase, and the market for wireless data
services expands. Superconductor expects that wireless service
providers in both rural and urban areas will encounter higher
levels of radio frequency, or RF, interference due to greater
subscriber density and a larger number of users on adjacent
channels. Operators can expect that this reduced signal quality
and higher percentage of dropped calls will lead to lower system
utilization, decreased revenue, and ultimately, higher rates of
customer churn.

Service providers are also expected to face
network capacity constraints. For example, wireless carriers are
finding it harder to maintain a guard band around
their frequency allocation in order to reduce interference
levels. In particular CDMA operators, whose networks employ the
same wide communications channels for both data and voice
transmission, are learning that as higher-speed data
transmissions proliferate, their networks will have less
capacity available for voice users.

In order to reduce the strain on their wireless
networks, providers must find a cost-effective means to reduce
interference and increase the capacity of their systems.
Notably, in light of todays restricted corporate budgets
and tougher zoning laws, operators are less likely to have the
option of simply deploying new base stations to achieve these
performance goals.

Superconductors Solution

Superconductors empirical data show that
Superconductors premium SuperLink Solutions provide
dramatic and cost-effective improvements to RF signal
quality and network capacity utilization. In February 2002, an
all-day session on superconductor technology was held at the
International Engineering Consortiums fifth annual
National Wireless Engineering Conference. At this session, a
top-five U.S. cellular operator presented data
illustrating the benefits of deploying SuperLink Solutions in an
urban environment. Over four weeks in November 2001, this CDMA
operator monitored data from a cluster of ten urban cell sites,
each outfitted with SuperFilter Systems. The operator stated
that on average, STIs solutions provided the following
quality-of-service improvements across the cluster:

 

6 dB reduction in base station noise
    figure  effectively doubling base station sensitivity
    and therefore uplink capacity and coverage;

 

14 dBm reduction in handset transmit
    power  prolonging handset battery life and available
    talk time;



 

46% reduction of dropped calls (with one site
    registering a 62% reduction) and 28.5% reduction of access
    failures  both helping to reduce subscriber churn;

 

Elimination of inference from Specialized Mobile
    Radio handsets and base stations; and

 

Increased in-building penetration.

Superconductor expects that Superconductors
more recently introduced product lines, Super Link TX Solutions
and SuperPlex Solutions, will also provide substantial
advantages for wireless networks.

SuperLink Tx Solutions, Superconductors
line of premium multi-carrier power amplifiers, employ advanced
linearization technology and are optimized for CDMA base
stations. Relative to competing technologies, Superconductor
believes that these products offer:

 

Superior reliability;

 

Improved peak power handling; and

 

Lowest cost of ownership.

SuperPlex Solutions, Superconductors line
of high-performance multiplexers, are designed to eliminate the
need for additional base station antennas and thus reduce
infrastructure costs. These products provide very low transmit
and receive insertion loss and excellent cross-band isolation.
Relative to competing technologies, Superconductor believes that
these products offer:

 

Increased transmit power delivered to base
    station antennas;

 

Higher sensitivity to customers handset
    signals; and

 

Fast and cost-effective network overlays (such as
    PCS network infrastructure on top of cellular network
    infrastructure).

Superconductors Strategy

Superconductor has mastered the use of
high-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology to
improve the quality of wireless networks. Superconductors
strategy is to provide Total Link Enhancement (simultaneously
optimizing the performance of the uplink, the downlink and the
antenna) by teaming Superconductors field-proven HTS
solutions with high-performance multiplexers and multi-carrier
power amplifiers. With SuperFilter at the core,
Superconductors SuperLink Solutions provide the only
comprehensive package of RF link performance enhancement
solutions available today.

The primary elements of Superconductors
strategy include:

Enhance and Extend Current Product
    Offerings.
 There is a constant demand
    for more compact, more efficient, and more sophisticated
    wireless communication technology. In response, Superconductor
    expects to use Superconductors technical expertise to
    expand Superconductors primary product lines, as
    represented by SuperLinkRx Solutions (uplink enhancement),
    SuperLink Tx Solutions (downlink enhancement), and SuperPlex
    Solutions (antenna optimization).

Expand Domestic and International Sales
    Channels. 
Superconductor intends to
    continue to expand Superconductors sales efforts to
    domestic wireless communication providers and OEMs.
    Superconductor also expects to expand Superconductors
    international distribution channels, particularly in Asia and
    Latin America.

Enhance Superconductors Productivity and
    Lower Superconductors Costs.

    Superconductor intends to continue developing
    Superconductors manufacturing infrastructure and
    organization to meet Superconductors expected production
    requirements. Superconductor plans to continue manufacturing
    in-house certain key components of Superconductors
    products such as Superconductors proprietary HTS filters
    and cryogenic coolers. Superconductor believes that this will
    enable us to: (1) produce highly reliable, quality
    products; (2) protect the proprietary nature of
    Superconductors technology and



processes; (3) properly control
    Superconductors manufacturing processes; and
    (4) achieve significant cost reductions.

Maintain Superconductors Focus on
    Technical Excellence and Innovation.

    Superconductor is committed to maintaining Superconductors
    leadership role in the wireless communication market for link
    enhancement solutions. In order to expand and protect
    Superconductors technology, Superconductor will continue
    to seek patent protection and/or licenses of key technology
    owned by others. Superconductor also will continue to engage in
    government research and development contracts to fund
    Superconductors commercial technology and product
    development.

Pursue Strategic Partnerships, Alliances and
    Acquisitions.
 In addition to
    Superconductors internal development efforts,
    Superconductor may acquire new products and technologies that
    address the complementary issues of uplink enhancement, downlink
    enhancement, and antenna optimization.

Superconductors Wireless
Products

Commercial wireless providers can use
Superconductors SuperLink Solutions to keep pace with the
growing demand for wireless communications. Wireless providers
may deploy Superconductors products in connection with the
installation of additional base stations in a network, as well
as with the installation of an entirely new network. They can
also improve the performance of existing base stations and
networks by retrofitting their equipment with
Superconductors link enhancement products.

Superconductors SuperLink Solutions are
comprised of three unique product families: SuperLink Rx
Solutions, SuperLink Tx Solutions, and SuperPlex Solutions.

 

SuperLink Rx Solutions include
    Superconductors core product line, the SuperFilter System.
    These uplink solutions combine specialized filters using HTS
    technology with a proprietary cryogenic cooler and a low-noise
    amplifier. The result is a highly compact and reliable cryogenic
    receiver front-end that can simultaneously deliver both high
    selectivity and high sensitivity. 

     The small size and low power consumption of
    Superconductors SuperLink Rx Solutions is largely the
    result of Superconductors choice of cooling technology. In
    order to incorporate a compact, efficient, and reliable cooling
    system, Superconductor developed a proprietary Stirling
    cryogenic cooler. Approximately the size of a wine bottle, the
    cooler utilizes helium gas as both the lubricant and coolant.
    This eliminates the use of oils and grease as well as the need
    for scheduled maintenance. Superconductors cooler requires
    approximately 100 watts of power  far less than other
    cryogenic systems.

 

SuperLink Tx Solutions consist of
    Superconductors line of premium multi-carrier power
    amplifiers. These solutions are geared toward downlink-limited
    environments and serve as a key element in Superconductors
    Total Link Enhancement strategy.

 

SuperPlex Solutions are HTS-Ready
TM

    (ready for immediate connection to Superconductors HTS
    filter products), high-performance multiplexers designed to
    eliminate the need for additional antennas and reduce costs.
    Their extremely low insertion loss and excellent cross-band
    isolation make them highly- effective HTS companion products.

Significantly, in early 2002 Superconductor
introduced the SuperFilter IMT-2000 Tower Top,
Superconductors first product for international 3G
networks. 3G, or third generation, wireless networks
use advanced technologies that promise to allow mobile devices
to offer high-speed data services such as full Internet access
and CD-quality music services. Superconductors SuperFilter
IMT-2000 Tower Top product provides the same premium benefits of
Superconductors rack-mount systems with the addition of a
duplexing function, allowing both transmit and receive signals
to be carried on the same antenna. The SuperFilter IMT-2000
Tower Top is designed to withstand harsh outside environments,
and it can be mounted adjacent to the base station antenna to
maximize sensitivity benefits.

During the years ended December 31, 1999 and
2000 Superconductors net commercial product revenues
totaled $2.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively,
and related primarily to the sales of Superconductors



SuperFilter System. For the year ended
December 31, 2001 Superconductors net commercial
product revenues totaled $7.6 million and was comprised of
$6.9 million from sales of Superconductors SuperFilter
System and $635,000 from sales of Superconductors
multiplexers. Superconductors multi-carrier power
amplifier product was introduced in March 2001; however, to date
it has not contributed significantly to Superconductors
revenues.

Marketing and Sales

Superconductor presently sells solutions to
wireless communication service providers in the Americas and
plans to expand worldwide. Superconductors earliest
experience was with small rural providers who had the most
immediate need for the SuperFilter for range extension and
coverage enhancement. Superconductor sold Superconductors
first systems in the fourth quarter of 1997. Superconductor sold
83 more systems in 1998, 123 systems in 1999, 393 systems in
2000 and 438 systems in 2001. Superconductor continues to
increase systems sales in spite of a shift in
Superconductors sales focus to the large service providers
where the sales cycle requires numerous trials and is very long.
This shift in focus was undertaken to begin a move to the
suburban and urban markets where the majority of base stations
are located and where the need for interference rejection is
greatest. In mid 1999, Superconductor signed a five-year supply
agreement with U.S. Cellular Corporation, one of the five
largest cellular providers in the country. In March 2000,
Superconductor signed a supply agreement with ALLTEL, an even
larger domestic wireless service provider, designating STI as
their supplier of HTS base station receiver solutions. More
recently, in December 2001, Superconductor signed a follow-on
agreement with a major customer for 1,000 SuperFilter Systems,
to be delivered over five quarters. U.S. Cellular and ALLTEL are
Superconductors two largest customers and accounted for
85% of Superconductors net commercial revenues in 2001 as
compared to 49% in 2000.

Superconductor sells using a direct sales force
in the U.S. and internationally. Superconductor has only
recently begun efforts to market Superconductors products
internationally and have not yet had significant international
sales. Superconductor plans to supplement Superconductors
direct sales by building a network of international
distributors. Superconductor is also working with many
consulting firms to provide data that illustrates the benefits
of deploying Superconductors products in their
customers networks. Superconductor also demonstrates
Superconductors products at trade shows, participates in
industry conferences, utilizes advertising and direct mailings,
and provides technical and application reports to recognized
trade journals. Superconductor also advertises
Superconductors products through Superconductors
website, brochures, data sheets, application notes, trade
journal reports, and press releases. Superconductors sales
and marketing efforts are supplemented by a team of engineers
who manage field trials and initial customer installations and
educate customers.

Backlog

Superconductors backlog consists of
accepted commercial product purchase orders scheduled for
delivery within 24 months and includes purchase orders
denominated in either dollar amounts or a specified number of
units. For purposes of calculating the companys backlog,
Superconductor estimates a dollar amount for unit commitments
based on past purchasing patterns and expected purchasing
trends. Superconductor estimates that its backlog at
September 28, 2002 was approximately $6.7 million, as
compared to $21.3 million at December 31, 2001.
Superconductor expects that this backlog will be delivered by
the end of the first quarter of 2003. Superconductors
backlog also includes $1.1 million and $3.1 million at
September 28, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively, remaining under a $7.8 million purchase order
from U.S. Cellular that will be delivered by
December 31, 2002.

Superconducting Technology

Superconductor uses superconducting technology to
improve both the selectivity (rejection of adjacent band
interference) and the sensitivity (ability to hear
signals better) of a base station receiver. Superconductors are
materials that have the ability to conduct electrical energy
with little or no resistance when cooled to critical
temperatures. In contrast, electric currents that flow through
normal conductors encounter resistance that requires power to
overcome and generates heat. Substantial improvements in the
performance



characteristics of electrical systems can be made
with superconductors, including reduced power loss, lower heat
generation and decreased electrical noise. As these properties
have been applied to radio and microwave frequency applications,
new products, such as wireless filters, have been developed that
can be extremely small, highly sensitive and highly frequency
selective.

The discovery of superconductors was made in
1911. However, a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of
superconductivity eluded physicists until J. Robert Schrieffer
(one of the members of Superconductors board of directors
and Chairman of Superconductors Technical Advisory Board),
John Bardeen (co-inventor of the transistor) and Leon Cooper
proposed a theory explaining superconductivity, for which they
were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. Until 1986, all
superconductor utilization was done at extremely low
temperatures, below 23K (-250C). Superconductors were not widely
used in commercial applications because of the high cost and
complexities associated with reaching and maintaining such low
temperatures. In 1986, high temperature superconductors with
critical temperatures greater than 30K (-243C) were discovered.
In early 1987, yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO)
was discovered, which has a critical temperature of 93K (-180C).
Shortly thereafter, thallium barium calcium copper oxide
(TBCCO) was discovered, which has a critical
temperature of 125K (-148C). These discoveries were important
because these high temperature superconductors allowed for
operating temperatures higher than 77K (-196C), or the point at
which nitrogen liquefies. These high critical temperatures allow
superconductors to be cooled using less expensive and more
conventional refrigeration processes. Superconductors
Company was formed following this discovery for the initial
purpose of developing and commercializing high temperature
superconductors.

How Superconductor Develops
Superconductors Technology

As part of Superconductors strategy to
maintain Superconductors technological leadership,
Superconductor has focused Superconductors research and
development activities on high temperature superconducting
(HTS) materials, RF circuitry, and cryogenics design and
product application. Superconductor has internally developed
Superconductors key technologies from a standard set of
technology platforms. Superconductor utilizes a proprietary
manufacturing process for HTS thin-film production, the base
material for Superconductors filtering products. An
in-house design team develops the filters, which are packaged
into a vacuum-sealed container for thermal insulation. The
filter package is incorporated with Superconductors
cryogenic cooler and then integrated with the necessary control
electronics into a complete system for simple adaptation into
new or existing wireless communications base stations.
Superconductor believes that Superconductors filter
systems provide Superconductors targeted markets with the
smallest and most cost-effective products and that
Superconductor is the only superconducting company that develops
and manufactures all of these key components.

HTS Materials

A number of HTS materials have been discovered
with superconducting properties, but only a few have
characteristics capable of commercialization. Superconductor
primarily utilizes TBCCO, which has one of the highest known
critical temperatures, allowing for reduced cooling needs in
order to achieve superconducting properties. Superconductor
holds a worldwide exclusive license, in all fields of use, to
TBCCO formulations covered by patents held by the University of
Arkansas through a license agreement. As part of
Superconductors strategy to stimulate the development and
use of TBCCO, Superconductor granted DuPont a non-exclusive
worldwide sublicense to develop processes and market TBCCO
thin-films. Thin-film superconductors are the base materials
used by Superconductor to produce RF components, such as
wireless communications filters. Superconductor holds twelve
patents for technologies related to thin-film production.
Superconductor believes that the process technology
Superconductor has developed produces state of the art HTS
thin-films of the highest quality.

RF Circuitry

Superconductor has devoted a significant portion
of Superconductors engineering resources to design and
model the complex RF circuitry that is basic to
Superconductors products. Superconductors RF
engineering



team is led by Vice President of Engineering
Dr. Gregory Hey-Shipton and includes Dr. George Matthaei,
recognized international leaders in RF filter design. In
addition, Dr. J. Robert Schrieffer, a Nobel laureate, is
head of Superconductors Technical Advisory Board. The
expertise of this highly qualified team has allowed us to design
and fabricate very precise individual components, such as RF
signal filters. Superconductor has implemented computer
simulation systems to design Superconductors products and
this RF circuitry design has allowed it to produce extremely
small, high-performance circuits. Some of Superconductors
design and engineering innovations have been patented; others
are the subjects of pending patent applications. Superconductor
believes that Superconductors RF engineering expertise
provides it with a unique competitive advantage.

Cryogenic Cooling Technology

The availability of a low-cost, highly reliable,
compact cooling technology is critical to the successful
commercialization of Superconductors superconducting
products. Prior to the Companys efforts no such cryogenic
cooler had been commercially available. In response to this lack
of availability, Superconductor developed a low-cost, highly
reliable low-power cooler designed to cool to 77K (-196C) with
sufficient cooling capacity for Superconductors
superconducting applications. Superconductors cryogenic
cooler, with over 10,000,000 hours of operation in wireless base
stations worldwide, has demonstrated a mean time between failure
of greater than 850,000 hours. Its development was based in part
on patents licensed by the Company from Sunpower, Inc.
Superconductor believes that Superconductors internally
developed cooler that is both compact and reliable enough to
meet the most demanding wireless industry standards and provide
it with a significant and unique competitive advantage.

Cryogenic Packaging

Cooling to cryogenic temperatures requires proper
thermal isolation and packaging. Any superconducting or other
cryogenically cooled device must be maintained at its optimal
operating temperature, and its interaction with higher
temperature components must be controlled. Superconductor has
developed a variety of proprietary and patented cryogenic
packaging innovations to satisfy this requirement.

How Superconductor Uses Government Contracts
to Fund Technology Development

Superconductors strategy is to pursue
government research and development contract awards, which
complement Superconductors commercial product and
technology development. For example, Superconductor is currently
working on a project to develop rapid tuning of superconducting
filters funded by the Department of Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA). This capability would greatly increase
the effectiveness of Superconductors systems in blocking
interference in both government and commercial applications.

Since Superconductors inception in 1987,
77% of Superconductors net revenues have been from
research and development contracts, sales directly with the U.S.
government or resellers to the U.S. government. In the fiscal
years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
Superconductors performance of research and development
services under government contracts accounted for, respectively,
approximately $5.1 million, $4.6 million and
$4.8 million. Nearly all of these revenues were paid under
contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense. Superconductor
has marketed to various government agencies to identify
opportunities and actively solicit partners for product
development proposals. Since 1988, Superconductor has
successfully obtained a number of classified and non-classified
government contracts for superconductor research, including one
of the largest non-classified HTS awards from DARPA through the
Office of Naval Research. In addition to actively soliciting
government contracts, Superconductor has participated in the
Small Business Innovative Research, or SBIR, program.
Superconductor has been awarded 32 Phase I SBIR contracts,
each of which typically generates from $70,000 to $100,000 of
revenues. Superconductor has been successful in converting eight
of these Phase I contracts into Phase II programs,
each of which typically generates $500,000 to $750,000 in
revenues, and Superconductor converted one of these contracts
into a Phase III program valued at $2.2 million. Since
Superconductors formation, government contracts have



provided Superconductor over $65 million of
revenue, and remain a significant source of revenue today,
supporting Superconductors research and development
programs.

Superconductors Manufacturing
Capabilities

Superconductor currently manufactures all of
Superconductors SuperFilter Systems and multiplexer
products at Superconductors facilities in Santa Barbara,
California. In 1998, Superconductor opened a new 18,000 square
foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Santa Barbara.
As the demand for Superconductors products grows in 2002,
Superconductor intends to increase Superconductors
internal manufacturing capacity by three fold expanding
manufacturing into an additional 12,800 square feet (within the
existing site). The expansion will include additional class
100 clean rooms, semi-automated assembly and test
area, along with new customer service and quality assurance
functions. Superconductor also has plans in place to expand
Superconductors manufacturing capacity through
subcontractors as volumes increase.

Some of Superconductors manufacturing
processes, including thin-film production, are performed in
clean rooms. Other manufacturing stages, including
system assembly, are conducted in a standard manufacturing
environment. Superconductor has demonstrated a proprietary
manufacturing process for thin-film TBCCO materials that
Superconductor believes is scaleable for high volume production.
Superconductor has established a production operation, which
Superconductor uses to produce TBCCO thin films on wafers for
wireless electronics applications. Superconductor currently
purchases wafers for growth of Superconductors HTS thin
films from a single supplier. Superconductors radio
frequency circuitry is designed, modeled and tested by internal
engineering resources. Superconductor has in-house capabilities
to pattern the superconducting material and all other aspects of
radio frequency component production, including packaging the
filters. Superconductor also has in-house capabilities to
manufacture Superconductors cryogenic coolers at a pace
consistent with current quantity requirements.

Superconductors multi-carrier power
amplifier is purchased from a third party manufacturer.

Intellectual Property

Superconductor regards Superconductors
product designs, design tools, fabrication equipment and
manufacturing processes as proprietary and seek to protect
Superconductors rights in them through a combination of
patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal
procedures and non-disclosure agreements. Superconductor also
seeks licenses from third parties for HTS materials and
processes used by it, which have been patented by other parties.
Superconductor believes that Superconductors success will
depend, in part, on the protection of Superconductors
proprietary information, patents and the licensing of key
technologies from third parties.

Superconductor has focused Superconductors
HTS materials development efforts on TBCCO. Superconductor has
an exclusive worldwide license (including the right to
sublicense) under several U.S. patents which have been
issued to the University of Arkansas covering TBCCO, subject to
the University of Arkansas right to conduct research
related to the patents.

In January 1993, as part of Superconductors
strategy to stimulate the development and use of TBCCO,
Superconductor granted DuPont a non-exclusive worldwide
sublicense to develop processes and market TBCCO thin-films.
DuPont pays royalties on sales of TBCCO thin-films or devices
containing TBCCO thin-films. In the event that Superconductor
grants another sublicense to a third party on more favorable
terms, Superconductor will be obligated to extend those terms to
DuPont. DuPont and their customers are current or potential
competitors of Superconductors, and Superconductor can
give no assurance that these sublicenses will not materially and
adversely affect Superconductors financial condition.

As of August 15, 2002, Superconductor held
32 U.S. patents. Twelve of these patents are for technologies
directed toward producing thin-film materials, including
Superconductors proprietary thin-film process for TBCCO
production, expiring in 2008 to 2016. In addition,
Superconductor currently holds nine U.S. patents for
circuit designs expiring in 2010 to 2017 and eleven
U.S. patents covering cryogenics and packaging



expiring in 2012 to 2020. As of August 15,
2002, Superconductor had 19 U.S. patents pending, including
twelve covering Superconductors designs and seven related
to cryogenics and packaging.

As of August 15, 2002, Superconductor held
25 foreign patents. Eleven of these patents are for technologies
directed toward producing thin-film materials, including
Superconductors proprietary thin-film process for TBCCO
production, expiring in 2009 to 2015. In addition,
Superconductor currently holds five foreign patents for circuit
designs expiring in 2014 to 2021 and nine foreign patents
covering cryogenics and packaging expiring in 2015 to 2019. As
of August 15, 2002, Superconductor had 15 foreign patents
pending, including seven covering Superconductors designs
and four related to cryogenics and packaging and four related to
thin film development. Superconductor also has license rights to
13 issued patents in the United States and to 57 patents
issued or pending internationally.

Superconductor has trade secrets and unpatented
technology and proprietary knowledge about the sale, promotion,
operation, development and manufacturing of
Superconductors products. Superconductor has
confidentiality agreements with Superconductors employees
and consultants to protect these rights.

Superconductor owns a federally registered
trademark to the name SuperFilter. Superconductor owns other
registered and unregistered trademarks, and have certain
trademark rights in foreign jurisdictions. Superconductor
intends to aggressively protect Superconductors trademarks.

Competition

The wireless communication market is intensely
competitive. Superconductor faces competition in various aspects
of Superconductors technology and product development and
in each of Superconductors targeted markets.
Superconductors current and potential competitors include
conventional RF filter manufacturers and both established and
newly emerging companies developing similar or competing HTS
technologies. Superconductor also competes with companies that
design, manufacture, or market conventional downlink enhancement
products such as power amplifiers, as well as with companies
that sell antenna-optimizing multiplexers. With respect to
Superconductors HTS filter systems Superconductor competes
primarily with Conductus and ISCO International, Inc., formerly
Illinois Superconductor Corporation. Superconductor also
competes against companies that seek to enhance base station
range and selectivity by means other than a superconducting
filter. The primary competition from alternative means comes
from tower mount and ground mount amplifiers and
smart antennas. Tower mount and ground mount
amplifiers pass an RF signal received by an antenna through a
broad, low-level filter, which then amplifies the signal. These
units are produced by a number of companies, which include most
of the base station original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such
as Motorola, Lucent, Nortel and Nokia. Filter manufacturers,
including Allen Telecom and Radio Frequency Systems (formerly
Celwave), also produce these units. Smart antennas
allow base stations to focus energy more directly on individual
wireless devices in order to improve capacity. Metawave and
Arraycom are among the leading companies that produce these
systems.

In addition, Superconductor currently supplies
components and license technology to several companies that may
eventually decide to manufacture or design their own HTS
components, rather than simply purchasing or licensing
Superconductors technology. With respect to
Superconductors HTS materials, Superconductor competes
here with DuPont and Amtel, a Japanese consortium, among others.
In the government sector, Superconductor competes with
universities, national laboratories and both large and small
companies for research and development contracts. Superconductor
expects increased competition both from existing competitors and
a number of companies that may enter the wireless communications
market.

Employees

Superconductor employed a total of
194 persons as of October 22, 2002: 116 in
manufacturing, 34 in research and development, 22 in sales and
marketing and 22 in administration. Nine of
Superconductors employees have Ph.D.s, and twenty-three
others hold advanced degrees in physics, materials science,
electrical engineering and other fields. Superconductors
employees are not represented by a labor union, and
Superconductor believes that its employee relations are good.



Superconductor is highly dependent upon the
efforts of Superconductors senior management. Due to the
specialized technical nature of Superconductors business,
Superconductor is also highly dependent upon
Superconductors ability to attract and retain qualified
technical personnel, primarily in the areas of wireless
communications. The loss of the services of one or more members
of Superconductors senior management or technical teams
could hinder Superconductors ability to achieve
Superconductors product development and commercialization
objectives. There is intense competition for qualified personnel
in Superconductors market areas and Superconductor can
give no assurance that Superconductor will be able to continue
to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the
development of Superconductors business.

Environmental Issues

The Company uses certain hazardous materials in
its research, development and manufacturing operations. As a
result, the Company is subject to stringent federal, state and
local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of
such materials. Current or future laws and regulations could
require substantial expenditures for preventative or remedial
action, reduction of chemical exposure or waste treatment or
disposal. Although the Company believes that its safety
procedures for the handling and disposing of hazardous materials
comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal
regulations, there is always the risk of accidental
contamination or injury from these materials. To date, the
Company has not incurred substantial expenditures for preventive
action with respect to hazardous materials or for remedial
action with respect to any hazardous materials accident, but the
use and disposal of hazardous materials involves the risk that
the Company could incur substantial expenditures for such
preventive or remedial actions. If such an accident occurred,
the Company could be held liable for resulting damages. The
liability in the event of an accident or the costs of such
remedial actions could exceed the Companys resources or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition and results of operations.

Properties

Superconductor leases all of
Superconductors properties. Most of Superconductors
operations, including Superconductors manufacturing
facility, are located in an industrial complex in Santa Barbara,
California. Superconductor occupies approximately 59,000 square
feet under a lease that expires in 2010; 24,000 square feet of
this space was leased in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Superconductor plans to use the additional space to expand
Superconductors manufacturing capability and for general
office space. Superconductor also leases small regional sales
offices in Illinois, Texas and Washington on annual terms.
Superconductor believes that Superconductors facilities
are adequate to meet current and reasonably anticipated needs
for approximately the next year.

Legal Proceedings

Superconductor is currently engaged in a patent
dispute with ISCO International, Inc. relating to
U.S. Patent No. 6,263,215 entitled
Cryoelectronically Cooled Receiver Front End for Mobile
Radio Systems. ISCO filed a complaint on July 17,
2001 in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware against Superconductor and Conductus, Inc., another
company involved in the high-temperature superconducting
industry. The ISCO complaint alleges that Superconductors
SuperFilter product and Conductus ClearSite product
infringe ISCOs patent.

After conducting separate investigations into the
allegations, Superconductor and Conductus both filed responses
denying ISCOs allegations and asking the court to declare
the ISCO patent invalid and not infringed. Superconductor is
cooperating with Conductus in the defense of this lawsuit.

On October 3, 2001, Superconductor amended
Superconductors response to add allegations that ISCO
failed to disclose relevant prior art to the U.S. Patent
Office during the patent application process. At the same time,
Superconductor also sued ISCO for threatening some of
Superconductors customers. Superconductors standard
terms and conditions of sale include an indemnity against any
patent infringement claims, and Superconductor has informed
Superconductors customers that Superconductor will defend
them against any action brought by ISCO for any alleged
infringement related to Superconductors products.
Superconductor is



seeking both compensatory and punitive damages
from ISCO, as well as attorneys fees, arising from their
threats against Superconductors customers.

The parties completed fact discovery on
June 28, 2002. The judge held a Markman hearing
on October 15, 2002 to receive evidence concerning the
scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted by ISCO. On
October 30, 2002 the judge issued his ruling regarding the
hearing. The parties expect to complete expert discovery by
December 23, 2002 and the trial is scheduled to start
March 17, 2003.

(1) 

Except as set forth herein, each option vests
    over a four-year period at the rate of 1/4th of the shares
    subject to the option at the end of the first twelve months and
    1/36th of the remaining shares subject to the option at the end
    of each monthly period thereafter so long as such
    optionees employment with the Company has not terminated.

(2) 

Total number of shares subject to options granted
    to employees in fiscal 2001 was 745,500, which number includes
    options granted to employee directors, but excludes options
    granted to non-employee directors and consultants.

(3) 

The Potential Realizable Value is calculated
    based on the fair market value on the date of grant, which is
    equal to the exercise price of options granted in fiscal 2001,
    assuming that the stock appreciates in value from the date of
    grant until the end of the option term at the compounded annual
    rate specified (5% and 10%). Potential Realizable Value is net
    of the option exercise price. The assumed rates of appreciation
    are specified in rules of the SEC and do not represent the
    Companys estimate or projection of future stock price.
    Actual gains, if any, resulting from stock option exercises and
    common stock holdings are dependent on the future performance of
    the common stock and overall stock market conditions, as well as
    the option holders continued employment through the
    exercise/vesting period. There can be no assurance that the
    amounts reflected in this table will be achieved.

    minus the exercise price.

(2) 

All options are Conductus options. After the
    merger, such options will convert to Superconductor options as
    described herein.

Employment Agreements

Superconductor has employment agreements with
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Cotten. The Compensation Committee
periodically amends their employment agreements to reflect
approved increases in their base salaries. Mr. Thomas has a
current base salary of $286,200, and Mr. Cotten has a
current base salary of $149,916. Superconductor employs both
executives on an at will basis which means that
their employment may be terminated at any time without cause by
Superconductor or the executive. In the event of an
involuntary termination of employment,
Superconductor is obligated to continue paying the
executives base salary and provide group health and life
insurance to the executive and his dependents for twelve months.
In addition, all of Mr. Thomass unvested options
would immediately vest on the date of an involuntary
termination. An involuntary termination occurs if Superconductor
materially reduces the executives compensation or
responsibilities or terminates the executive without cause as
defined in his employment agreement. There are no other
employment agreements between Superconductor and any of its
executive officers. See discussion regarding
Mr. Shalvoys change in control agreement with
Conductus under Employment Contracts, Termination of
Employment Arrangements and Change in Control Agreements.

Director Compensation

Each non-employee director received an annual
retainer of $8,000 in 2001, and will receive $10,000 per year
commencing in 2002 (so long as such director attends at least
75% of Superconductors Board meetings) and $2,000 per
meeting attended. Commencing in January 1, 2001, the
Chairman received $4,000 per meeting. The non-employee directors
serving during 2001 since the last annual meeting were directors
H. Vaughan Blaxter, III, Robert P.
Caren, Ph.D., Dennis J. Horowitz, John D. Lockton
(Chairman of the Board), Joseph C. Manzinger, and
J. Robert Schrieffer, Ph.D. Non-employee directors
also participate in the 1999 Stock Plan, the 1992 Director
Option Plan, as amended, and the 1988 and 1992 Stock Option
Plans, as amended. The Director Plan provides for the grant of a
non-statutory stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of
common stock of Superconductor to each of the companys
non-employee directors on the date on which such person first
becomes a director. First options vest at the rate of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares granted on each
anniversary of the grant, and subsequent options vest at the
rate of fifty percent (50%) of the shares on each anniversary of
the date of grant. Non-employee directors that have served on
the board of directors for at least six months also receive
automatic grants of non-statutory stock options to purchase
10,000 shares of common stock each year with the Chairman
of the Board receiving an automatic grant of non-statutory stock
options to purchase 15,000 shares of common stock.
Non-employee directors that serve on



a committee of the board of directors also
receive automatic grants of non-statutory stock options to
purchase 1,000 shares of common stock for each committee
meeting attended with the committee chairmen receiving an
automatic grant of non-statutory stock options to purchase
2,000 shares of common stock.

Except as described above, directors do not
receive additional compensation for their services as directors
of Superconductor or as members of committees of the board of
directors. There are no family relationships between directors
and executive officers of Superconductor.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation

The Compensation Committee of
Superconductors board of directors is composed of five
non-employee directors, namely, Robert P. Caren, Ph.D.,
Dennis J. Horowitz, John D. Lockton, J. Robert
Schrieffer, Ph.D. and H. Vaughan Blaxter, III. No
interlocking relationship exists between Superconductors
board of directors and the compensation committee of any other
company, and no such interlocking relationship has existed in
the past.
