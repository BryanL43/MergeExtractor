                              $2.83 NET PER SHARE

                             AMGIS ACQUISITION CO.
                           A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY
                                       OF
                          DENDRITE INTERNATIONAL, INC.

THIS OFFER IS BEING MADE BY THE PURCHASER TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING
SHARES OF THE COMPANY FOR $2.83 PER SHARE. ON MAY 9, 2003, THE COMPANY'S BOARD
OF DIRECTORS APPROVED DENDRITE'S $2.83 OFFER AND THE MERGER DESCRIBED IN THIS
STATEMENT. ON MAY 15, 2003, THE PURCHASER PROPOSED TO INCREASE ITS OFFER TO
ACQUIRE THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING STOCK TO $3.22 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY'S BOARD
OF DIRECTORS HAS NOT APPROVED THE PURCHASER'S REVISED BID AND IS CURRENTLY
EVALUATING THE PROPOSAL. THIS OFFER RELATES ONLY TO THE $2.83 OFFER APPROVED BY
THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF AND WHEN THE COMPANY APPROVES OUR HIGHER
PROPOSAL, WE WILL AMEND THIS OFFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

     THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 11:59 P.M., NEW YORK CITY
TIME, ON FRIDAY, JUNE 13, 2003, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     Amgis Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite International, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation ("Dendrite"), is offering to purchase any and all of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of
SYNAVANT Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), including the associated
preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights" and, together with the Common
Stock, the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $2.83 per Share, net to the seller
in cash (the "Offer Price"), without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions described in Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") this Offer to
Purchase and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the
Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer").

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 9, 2003, (the "Merger Agreement") among Dendrite, the Purchaser and
the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, after the
purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of
the other conditions described in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a
result of the Merger, the Company, which will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Dendrite. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
treasury Shares held by the Company, Shares held by the Company, Dendrite or the
Purchaser, and Shares held by stockholders who are entitled to demand and
properly demand appraisal of their Shares pursuant to, and who comply in all
respects with the provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL relating to dissenters'
rights of appraisal) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, in cash, without interest.

     The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously determined to (1)
terminate the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2003 (the
"Cegedim Merger Agreement") among Cegedim SA, a corporation organized under the
laws of France ("Cegedim"), Jivago Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cegedim ("Jivago"), and the Company
and (2) withdraw its recommendation that the Company's stockholders tender their
Shares to Jivago pursuant to the offer by Jivago to purchase any and all of the
outstanding Shares at a purchase price of $2.30 per Share (the "Jivago Offer").

     The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement, the Offer, and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and has recommended that the Company's
stockholders tender their Shares in the Offer.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there having been
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
number of Shares which constitutes at least a majority of the Shares outstanding
on a diluted basis on the date of acceptance for payment ("on a diluted basis"
means the number of Shares outstanding, together with the Shares which the
Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants, options, or obligations
outstanding at that date under employee stock or similar benefit plans or
otherwise to the extent that the exercise prices or strike prices in respect of
such warrants, options, or obligations are less than the Offer Price), and (ii)
the Merger Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms. The
Offer is also subject to certain other conditions contained in this Offer to
Purchase. The Offer is not contingent on any financing condition.

                             ---------------------

                      THE DEALER MANAGER FOR THE OFFER IS:

                                  ADVEST, INC.

May 16, 2003

                                        ii

                                   IMPORTANT

     Any stockholder desiring to tender all or any portion of such stockholder's
Shares should either (1) complete and sign the Letter of Transmittal (or a
facsimile thereof) in accordance with the instructions in the Letter of
Transmittal and mail or deliver it together with the certificate(s) evidencing
tendered Shares, and any other required documents, to American Stock Transfer &
Trust Co. (the "Depositary"), (2) tender such Shares pursuant to the procedures
for book-entry transfer set forth in Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering
Shares") of this Offer to Purchase, or (3) request such stockholder's broker,
dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to effect the
transaction for such stockholder. Any stockholder whose Shares are registered in
the name of a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee
must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other
nominee if such stockholder desires to tender such Shares.

     In order to validly tender Shares, a stockholder must tender the associated
preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights") that were granted under the
Rights Agreement, dated August 29, 2000, between the Company and Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A., as amended by Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated May 9, 2003 (as
amended, the "Rights Agreement"). Until the Distribution Date (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) (see Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares")), the
Rights will be evidenced by the certificates for Shares registered in the names
of the holders thereof, and until a Distribution Date the tender of a Share will
constitute a tender of the associated Right. Upon a Distribution Date, separate
certificates evidencing the Rights (the "Rights Certificates") will be mailed to
holders of record of Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date
(and to each initial record holder of certain Shares originally issued after the
Distribution Date), and such separate Rights Certificates alone will thereafter
evidence the Rights.

     A stockholder who desires to tender Shares and whose certificates
evidencing such Shares are not immediately available, or who cannot comply with
the procedures for book-entry transfer on a timely basis, may tender such Shares
by following the procedures for guaranteed delivery set forth in Section 2
("Procedures for Tendering Shares").

     Copies of this Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal or any related
documents must not be mailed to or distributed or sent in, into or from any
country where such distribution or offering would require any additional
measures to be taken or would be in conflict with any law or regulation of such
country or any political subdivision thereof. Persons into whose possession this
document comes are required to inform themselves about and to observe any such
laws or regulations. This Offer to Purchase may not be used for, or in
connection with, any offer to or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction or
under any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or
is unlawful.

     Questions or requests for assistance may be directed to Strategic Stock
Surveillance, LLC (the "Information Agent") or to Advest, Inc. (the "Dealer
Manager") at their respective addresses and telephone numbers set forth on the
back cover of this Offer to Purchase. Additional copies of this Offer to
Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal and the other related tender offer materials
may also be obtained from the Information Agent or from brokers, dealers,
commercial banks or trust companies.

                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     The Purchaser is offering to purchase all of the outstanding Shares for
$2.83 per Share, net to the seller in cash. Through a question and answer
format, this summary term sheet is designed to explain to you, the stockholders
of the Company, a number of important terms of the proposed transaction. This
summary term sheet serves only as an introduction, and we urge you to carefully
read the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the accompanying Letter of
Transmittal in order to educate yourself fully on the details of the proposed
transaction. Cross-referenced text refers to sections within this Offer to
Purchase, unless otherwise noted.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY THE SHARES?

     Our name is Amgis Acquisition Co. We are a Delaware corporation formed for
the purpose of making a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding Shares. We
are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite International, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation, whose shares of common stock are listed on The Nasdaq National
Market. See Section 8 ("Certain Information Concerning the Purchaser and
Dendrite").

WHAT ARE THE CLASSES AND AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES SOUGHT IN THE OFFER? HOW MUCH IS
THE PURCHASER OFFERING TO PAY AND WHAT IS THE FORM OF PAYMENT?

     We are offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) of the Company for
$2.83 per share, net to you, in cash.

WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR EXPENSES?

     If you are the record owner of your Shares and you tender your Shares to us
in the Offer, you will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. If
you own your Shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders
your Shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for
doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any
charges will apply.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE OFFER?

     The purpose of the Offer is to enable Dendrite to acquire control of, and
the entire equity interest in, the Company. Following the Offer, Dendrite
intends to acquire any remaining equity interest in the Company that was not
acquired during the Offer at a price equal to $2.83 per Share in cash pursuant
to a Merger of the Purchaser with and into the Company. See "Introduction" and
Section 11 ("Purpose of the Offer; Plans for the Company After the Offer and the
Merger").

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     We are not obligated to purchase any Shares that you validly tender unless
the total number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn before the
expiration date of the Offer represents, in the aggregate, at least a majority
of the outstanding Shares (assuming the exercise of all warrants, options,
restricted stock units or other obligations outstanding that have strike prices
or exercise prices less than $2.83).

     We are also not obligated to purchase any Shares you validly tender if any
other conditions set forth in Section 14 ("Certain Conditions of the Offer") and
discussed in Section 1 ("Terms of the Offer") are not satisfied or waived. The
Offer is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by the Purchaser or
Dendrite.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     The Offer expires at 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on Friday, June 13,
2003, unless we extend the Offer. This is called the initial Expiration Date (as
defined below). See Section 1 ("Terms of the Offer"). Please note that, if you
cannot deliver everything that is required in order to validly tender your
Shares by the initial expiration date, you may be able to use a guaranteed
delivery procedure. The guaranteed delivery procedure is described later in this
Offer to Purchase under Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares").

HAS THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECEIVED A HIGHER OFFER?

     On May 13, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors received a proposal from
Cegedim to acquire all the outstanding Shares for $3.15 per Share. In response
to Cegedim's proposal, we proposed to increase our offer to $3.22 per Share. In
addition, we offered to advance up to $10,000,000 to the Company as a bridge
loan to provide short-term liquidity, which funds would be used to pay off the
CapitalSource Facility (as defined below) and for general working capital
purposes. The Company's Board of Directors is currently considering both
proposals. Under the terms of our revised proposal, we would increase our
purchase price to $3.22 per Share and all of the other terms and conditions of
the Offer and the Merger would remain the same.

     If the Company's Board of Directors approves our revised proposal or
another proposal by us, we would file an amendment to this Offer to Purchase in
accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC").

WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TENDER MY SHARES AND YOU INCREASE YOUR OFFER?

     If you tender your Shares under this Offer and our subsequent price
increase is approved by the Company's Board of Directors, you will receive the
higher purchase price. We will advise you of all of the revised terms of any
such offer. Once you tender your shares to us, you need not take any action in
order to receive the higher purchase price.

CAN THE PURCHASER EXTEND THE OFFER PAST THE INITIAL EXPIRATION DATE AND UNDER
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     Yes. We can and may be required to extend the Offer past the initial
expiration date. If we do so, you will be able to tender your Shares until 11:59
P.M., New York City time, on the new expiration date.

     Several terms, which were negotiated by the parties, define the
circumstances in which we can extend the Offer, including that: (i) if any
conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, the Offer may be
extended by the Purchaser but in no event may it be extended past August 1, 2003
without the Company's prior written consent, provided that if requested by the
Company, the Purchaser shall, on two occasions, extend the expiration date of
the Offer for a period not to exceed an aggregate of ten business days, if any
condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived and the Offer may be
extended in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant
to the Offer so as to comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
(ii) the Offer may be extended by the Purchaser on one occasion, for up to 10
business days if 90% of the Shares have not been validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of
such expiration date of the Offer, or (iii) the Offer may be extended if we are
required by law to extend the Offer. See Section 1 ("Terms of the Offer").

HOW DO I FIND OUT IF THE PURCHASER EXTENDS THE OFFER?

     If we extend the Offer, we will announce an extension no later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the business day after a scheduled expiration date
by issuing a press release and informing American Stock Transfer & Trust Co.,
who is the depositary for the Offer (the "Depositary"). See Section 1 ("Terms of
the Offer").

HOW DO I GET PAID FOR MY TENDERED SHARES?

     We will pay for the Shares accepted for payment by depositing the purchase
price with the Depositary. The Depositary will transmit to you the payment for
all Shares accepted for payment. See Section 3 ("Acceptance for Payment and
Payment for Shares").

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender your Shares, you must either deliver your share certificates,
together with a completed and signed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy
of it), any required signature guarantees and any other required documents, to
the Depositary or tender your Shares using the book-entry procedure described in
Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares"), in each case on or prior to the
expiration date. If your Shares

are held in street name, you can tender the Shares held by your nominee through
The Depository Trust Company.

     These materials must reach the Depositary before the Offer expires.
Detailed instructions are contained in the Letter of Transmittal and Section 2
("Procedures for Tendering Shares").

     If you cannot get all of the documents or instruments that you are required
to deliver to the Depositary, you can still tender your Shares if a bank,
broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is a
member in good standing of a recognized Securities Transfer Agents Medallion
Program or any other eligible institution guarantees that the Depositary will
receive the missing items within three Nasdaq National Market trading days. For
the tender to be valid, the Depositary must actually receive the missing items
within that three-day period. See Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares").

UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW MY PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     You can withdraw your tendered Shares at any time on or prior to the
scheduled expiration date. After the Offer expires, the tender is irrevocable
unless we have not accepted for payment your Shares by July 15, 2003. At and
after this date, you can withdraw your tendered Shares until we accept them for
payment. See Section 4 ("Withdrawal Rights").

HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw your Shares, you must deliver to the Depositary written
transmission notice of withdrawal that specifies your name, the number of Shares
being withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the Shares, if
different from the person who tendered the Shares. If you tendered your Shares
by giving instructions to a broker or nominee, you must instruct your broker or
nominee to arrange for the withdrawal of your Shares. See Section 4 ("Withdrawal
Rights").

WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE SALE OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER?

     The sale of Shares to us through the Offer will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, you
will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash that you receive from us for the Shares and the
adjusted tax basis of your Shares.

     We encourage you to consult with your own tax advisor about the particular
effect the Offer will have on you. See Section 5 ("Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences").

WHAT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONSUMMATE THE
PROPOSED TRANSACTION?

     We estimate that we will require approximately $48 million (and in any
event no more than $55 million) to consummate the Offer and to pay fees and
expenses related to the Offer and Merger. See Section 9 ("Source and Amount of
Funds").

DOES THE PURCHASER HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT FOR TENDERED
SHARES?

     Yes. We will obtain all necessary funds through capital contributions or
advances by Dendrite. Dendrite will have sufficient funds from cash on hand to
fully fund the Offer and the Merger. See Section 9 ("Source and Amount of
Funds").

IS THE PURCHASER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION ON WHETHER TO
TENDER SHARES IN THE OFFER?

     We do not think our financial condition is relevant to your decision
whether to tender Shares and accept the Offer because: (1) the Offer consists
solely of cash; (2) the Offer is not subject to any financing condition; (3)
Dendrite will have adequate cash; and (4) the Offer is for all outstanding
Shares.

WHAT DOES THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     On May 9, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously:

     - terminated the Cegedim Merger Agreement and withdrew its recommendation
       that the Company's stockholders tender their Shares to Jivago pursuant to
       the Jivago Offer;

     - determined that each of the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement
       are advisable and in your best interests; and

     - recommended that you tender your Shares in the Offer.

     See "Introduction" and Section 11 ("Purpose of the Offer; Plans for the
Company after the Offer and the Merger").

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS ALREADY AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

     There is no stockholder tender agreement in place in connection with the
Offer.

IF AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT, WHAT
HAPPENS TO THE COMPANY AFTER THE OFFER?

     Dendrite, the Company, and we have entered into a Merger Agreement that
provides for us to merge with and into the Company. The Merger requires
stockholders owning at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on the record
date (set to determine those persons entitled to vote on the Merger) to vote in
favor of the Merger. If the Offer is successful, we will own at least a majority
of the Shares on a diluted basis. We have agreed to vote these Shares in favor
of the Merger.

     Therefore, if we acquire at least a majority of the Shares pursuant to the
Offer, we will merge with and into the Company. Once the Merger is consummated,
the Company will no longer be publicly owned and will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Dendrite. In such case, the Common Stock will no longer be quoted
on The Nasdaq National Market System or on any other securities exchange. See
"Introduction" and Section 13 ("Effect of the Offer on the Market for the
Shares; Exchange Listing and Exchange Act Registration").

     Even if the Merger does not take place, if we purchase all of the tendered
Shares, there may be so few remaining stockholders and publicly-held Shares
that:

     - the Common Stock will no longer meet the requirements of The Nasdaq
       National Market System for continued listing and therefore may be
       delisted from The Nasdaq National Market System;

     - there may not be a public trading market for the Common Stock; and

     - the Company may cease making filings with the SEC or otherwise cease
       being required to comply with the SEC rules and regulations relating to
       publicly-held companies.

     See Section 13 ("Effect of the Offer on the Market for the Shares; Exchange
Listing and Exchange Act Registration") and Section 15 ("Certain Legal Matters
and Regulatory Approvals").

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER BUT THE OFFER IS SUCCESSFUL, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY
SHARES?

     If the Offer is successful and the Merger occurs, stockholders who do not
tender in the Offer will receive the same amount of cash per Share that they
would have received had they tendered their Shares in the Offer, subject to any
rights of appraisal they may have and which they properly exercise under
Delaware law. Therefore, if the Merger takes place, the only difference to you
between tendering your Shares and not tendering is that you will be paid earlier
if you tender your Shares in the Offer. Because cash will be paid in the Merger,
the Company's stockholders will have appraisal rights under Delaware law. For a
discussion of appraisal rights, see Section 11 ("Certain Legal Matters and
Regulatory Approvals").

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES OF A RECENT DATE?

     On May 9, 2003, the last full trading day before the Company announced the
execution of the Merger Agreement, the closing price of a Share of the Company
was $2.58. On April 17, 2003, the last full trading day before the date Dendrite
made its unsolicited proposal to the Company's Board of Directors for a merger,
the closing price of a Share of the Company was $2.26. On the May 15, 2003, the
last full trading day before the commencement of the Offer, the closing price of
a Share of the Company was $3.14.

     Between May 10, 2002 and May 9, 2003, the closing price of a Share ranged
between $0.41 and $3.06. We encourage you to obtain a current market quotation
for your Shares before deciding whether to tender your Shares. See Section 6
("Price Range of Shares; Dividends").

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

     Stockholders can call Strategic Stock Surveillance, LLC, the Information
Agent for the Offer, at (866) 657-8728 or Advest, Inc., the Dealer Manager for
the Offer, at (617) 348-2320. See the back cover of this Offer to Purchase for
further contact information.

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF
SYNAVANT INC.

                                  INTRODUCTION

     Amgis Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite International, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation ("Dendrite"), hereby offers to purchase any and all of the
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), of SYNAVANT Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights" and, together with the
Common Stock, the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $2.83 per Share, net to the
seller in cash (the "Offer Price"), without interest, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions described in this Offer to Purchase and in the related Letter
of Transmittal (which, together with this Offer to Purchase and any amendments
or supplements hereto and thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer").
Following the Offer, the Purchaser intends to effect the Merger described below.

     Tendering stockholders whose Shares are registered in their own name and
who tender directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated
to pay brokerage fees or commissions to the Purchaser or the Depositary or,
except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, U.S. federal,
state or local transfer taxes on the sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Stockholders who hold their Shares through a bank or broker should check with
such institution as to whether they charge any service fees. The Purchaser will
pay the fees and expenses of Advest, Inc., which is acting as the Dealer Manager
(the "Dealer Manager"), American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., which is acting as
the Depositary (the "Depositary"), Strategic Stock Surveillance, LLC, which is
acting as Information Agent (the "Information Agent"), incurred in connection
with the Offer. See Section 16 ("Fees and Expenses").

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of May 9, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Dendrite, the Purchaser and
the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, after the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, the Purchaser will be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the Company, which will
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"), will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite. At the
effective time of the Merger, each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time (other than Shares owned by the Company, Dendrite or
the Purchaser, and any Shares held by stockholders who are entitled to demand
and properly demand appraisal of their Shares pursuant to, and who comply in all
respects with the provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL relating to dissenters'
rights of appraisal will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price,
in cash, without interest.

THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THERE HAVING BEEN VALIDLY
TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER THE NUMBER OF
SHARES WHICH CONSTITUTES AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A
DILUTED BASIS ON THE DATE OF ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT ("ON A DILUTED BASIS" MEANS
THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES WHICH THE COMPANY MAY
BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE PURSUANT TO WARRANTS, OPTIONS, OR OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING
AT THAT DATE UNDER EMPLOYEE STOCK OR SIMILAR BENEFIT PLANS OR OTHERWISE TO THE
EXTENT THAT THE EXERCISE PRICES OR STRIKE PRICES IN RESPECT OF SUCH WARRANTS,
OPTIONS, OR OBLIGATIONS ARE LESS THAN THE OFFER PRICE) (THE "MINIMUM
CONDITION"). THE OFFER IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN
THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE. SEE SECTION 1 ("TERMS OF THE OFFER") AND SECTION 14
("CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER"), WHICH DESCRIBES IN FULL THE CONDITIONS TO
THE OFFER. THE OFFER IS NOT CONTINGENT ON DENDRITE OR THE PURCHASER OBTAINING
ANY FINANCING.

     The Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by
stockholders of the Company, if applicable law requires such approval. In the
event the Purchaser acquires 90% or more of the outstanding Shares pursuant to
the Offer or otherwise, the Purchaser would be able to effect the Merger
pursuant to the short-form Merger provisions of the DGCL, without prior notice
to, or any action by, any other stockholder of the Company. In such event, the
Purchaser could, and intends to, effect the Merger without prior notice to, or
any action by, any other stockholder of the Company. See Section 10 ("Background
of the Offer; The Merger Agreement").

     The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the Offer
is a superior proposal to the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of April 12, 3003 (the "Cegedim Merger Agreement") among Cegedim, SA, a
corporation organized under the laws of France ("Cegedim"), Jivago Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cegedim
("Jivago") and therefore has terminated the Cegedim Merger Agreement.

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF
THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY'S
STOCKHOLDERS TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE OFFER.

     Alterity Partners LLC, the Company's financial advisor, has delivered to
the Company's Board of Directors its written opinion dated May 9, 2003 to the
effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters set forth
therein, the consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares. A copy of such
opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached in full as an
annex to the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(the "Schedule 14D-9"), which is being mailed to stockholders of the Company
concurrently herewith. Holders of Shares are encouraged to read the opinion
carefully and in its entirety.

     The Merger Agreement is more fully described in Section 10 ("Background of
the Offer; The Merger Agreement"). Certain U.S. Federal income tax consequences
of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the exchange of Shares for the
offer price pursuant to the Merger are described in Section 5 ("Certain U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences").

     As of March 31, 2003, there were 15,242,578 Shares issued and outstanding
and options, rights and restricted stock units representing in the aggregate
1,751,881 Shares with an exercise price or strike price less than the Offer
Price.

THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE
OFFER.

     The Offer does not constitute a solicitation of proxies for any meeting of
the stockholders of the Company or any offer to sell or solicitation of offers
to buy Dendrite common stock or other securities. Any such solicitation will be
made only pursuant to separate proxy materials pursuant to the requirements of
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act.

                                THE TENDER OFFER

1.  TERMS OF THE OFFER.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or
amendment, the Purchaser will accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares
validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and not theretofore properly
withdrawn in accordance with Section 4 ("Withdrawal Rights"). The term
"Expiration Date" means 11:59 P.M., New York City time, Friday, June 13, 2003,
unless the Purchaser shall have extended the expiration of the Offer, in which
event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date at which
the Offer, as so extended by the Purchaser, shall expire.

     The Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement discussed below and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC), at any time and from time to time, and
regardless of whether or not any of the events set forth in Section 14 ("Certain
Conditions of the Offer") hereof shall have occurred, to (i) extend in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement the period of time during
which the Offer is open and thereby delay acceptance for payment of, and the
payment for, any Shares, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to
the Depositary and making a public announcement of such extension and (ii) amend
the Offer in any other respect by giving oral or written notice of such
amendment to the Depositary and filing an amendment to this Offer to Purchase
with the SEC. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID BY THE PURCHASER ON
THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR
ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

     If by 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on Friday, June 13, 2003 (or any
other date or time then set as the Expiration Date), any or all conditions to
the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, the Purchaser reserves the right
(but shall not be obligated), subject to the terms and conditions contained in
the Merger Agreement and to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, to
(i) terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any Shares and return all
tendered Shares to tendering stockholders, (ii) waive all the unsatisfied
conditions (other than the Minimum Condition) and accept for payment, and pay
for, all Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not
theretofore withdrawn, (iii) extend the Offer and, subject to the right of
stockholders to withdraw Shares until the Expiration Date, retain the Shares
that have been tendered during the period or periods for which the Offer is
extended, or (iv) amend the Offer.

     The Purchaser will not necessarily exercise its right to extend the Offer
(other than as may be required by the Merger Agreement or by applicable law).
Any extension, waiver, amendment or termination will be followed as promptly as
practicable by public announcement. In the case of an extension, Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act requires that the announcement be issued no later than
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled Expiration Date. Subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d)
and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act, which require that any material change in
the information published, sent or given to stockholders in connection with the
Offer be promptly disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed
to inform stockholders of such change), and without limiting the manner in which
the Purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, the Purchaser will not
have any obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such
public announcement other than by issuing a press release. The phrase "business
day" as used in this paragraph has the meaning set forth in Rule 14d-1 under the
Exchange Act.

     The Merger Agreement provides that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, the Purchaser shall not extend the Expiration Date beyond the
initial Expiration Date, except (i) as required by applicable law, (ii) that if,
immediately prior to the Expiration Date (as it may be extended), the Shares
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute less than 90% of the
outstanding Shares, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, on one occasion,
extend the Offer for a period not to exceed 10 business days or (iii) that if
any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived, the Purchaser may,
in its sole discretion, extend the Expiration Date for one or more periods but
no later than August 1, 2003 without the Company's prior written consent;
provided that (1) if requested by the Company, the Purchaser shall, on two
occasions, extend the

expiration date of the Offer for a period not to exceed an aggregate of ten
business days, if any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived,
and (2) the Offer may be extended in connection with an increase in the
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to comply with SEC rules
and regulations. If the Purchaser extends the Offer or if the Purchaser (whether
before or after its acceptance for payment of Shares) delays its acceptance for
payment of or payment for Shares or is unable to pay for Shares pursuant to the
Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the Purchaser's rights under
the Offer, the Depositary may retain tendered Shares on behalf of the Purchaser,
and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent tendering stockholders
are entitled to withdrawal rights as described in Section 4. However, the
ability of the Purchaser to delay the payment for Shares that the Purchaser has
accepted for payment is limited by Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which
requires that a bidder pay the consideration offered or return the securities
deposited by or on behalf of holders of securities promptly after the
termination or withdrawal of such bidder's offer.

     If the Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the
information concerning the Offer or waives a material condition of the Offer,
the Purchaser will disseminate additional tender offer materials and extend the
Offer to the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act. The minimum period during which the Offer must remain open
following material changes in the terms of the Offer or information concerning
the Offer, other than a change in price or a change in the percentage of
securities sought or any dealer solicitation fee, will depend upon the facts and
circumstances then existing, including the relative materiality of the changed
terms or information. With respect to a change in price or a change in the
percentage of securities sought, a minimum period of ten business days is
generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders.

     The Company has provided the Purchaser with the Company's stockholder lists
and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to
holders of the Shares. This Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal
and other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of Shares and
furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and other
nominees whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder
lists or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's
security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of
Shares.

2.  PROCEDURES FOR TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tender of Shares.  In order for Shares to be validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer, a holder of Shares must, prior to the Expiration Date or
the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period (as defined below):

     - deliver to the Depositary at its address set forth on the back cover of
       this Offer to Purchase a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
       Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) with any required signature
       guarantees, the certificates representing the Shares (the "Share
       Certificates") to be tendered and any other documents required to be
       included with the Letter of Transmittal under the terms and subject to
       the conditions thereof and of this Offer to Purchase;

     - cause such holder's broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or
       custodian to tender applicable Shares pursuant to the procedures for
       book-entry transfer described below; or

     - comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below.

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS,
INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION
AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER. DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN
ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION AS DESCRIBED BELOW). IF DELIVERY IS BY
MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS
RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY
DELIVERY.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The Depositary will establish an account with respect
to the Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in Section 3
("Acceptance for Payment and Payment for Shares")) for purposes of the Offer
within two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial
institution that is a participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility may make a book-entry delivery of Shares by causing such Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account at such
Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with such Book-Entry Transfer
Facility's procedures for such transfer. However, although delivery of Shares
may be effected through book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with any required
signature guarantees (as described below under the caption "Signature
Guarantees"), or an Agent's Message (as defined below), and any other required
documents, must, in any case, be received by the Depositary at its address set
forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase on or prior to the Expiration
Date or the expiration of any subsequent offering period, or the tendering
stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below.
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY.

     Signature Guarantees.  Signatures on all Letters of Transmittal must be
guaranteed by a firm that is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as such
term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing
being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"), except in cases where Shares
are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who has not completed either
the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special
Delivery Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii) for the account of
an Eligible Institution. If a Share Certificate is registered in the name of a
person other than the person who or that signs the Letter of Transmittal, or if
payment is to be made, or a Share Certificate not accepted for payment or not
tendered is to be returned to a person other than the registered holder(s), then
the Share Certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s)
appear(s) on the Share Certificate, with the signature(s) on such Share
Certificate or stock powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See
Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and such stockholder's Share Certificates evidencing such Shares are
not immediately available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration Date, or the procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer cannot be
completed on a timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered, provided
that all the following conditions are satisfied:

     - such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

     - a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery,
       substantially in the form made available by the Purchaser, is received by
       the Depositary on or prior to the Expiration Date as provided below; and

     - the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in
       Section 3 below)) evidencing all tendered Shares, in proper form for
       transfer, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal (or a
       facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any
       required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer,
       a Book-Entry Confirmation along with an Agent's Message), and any other
       documents required by the Letter of Transmittal, are received by the
       Depositary within three Nasdaq National Market System trading days after
       the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or mail or
transmitted by telegram or facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must
include a guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form
of Notice of Guaranteed Delivery made available by the Purchaser. In the case of
Shares held through the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, the Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery must be delivered to the Depositary by a participant by means of the
confirmation system of the Book-Entry Transfer Facility.

     In all cases (including any subsequent offering period), payment for Shares
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after
timely receipt by the Depositary of the Share Certificates evidencing such
Shares, or a Book-Entry Confirmation of the delivery of such Shares, and the
Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly
executed, with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a
book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message), and any other documents required by
the Letter of Transmittal.

     Determination of Validity.  All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender
of Shares will be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, which
determination will be final and binding on all parties. The Purchaser reserves
the right in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement
and the rules and regulations of the SEC, to reject any and all tenders
determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. The Purchaser also reserves the
absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares
of any particular stockholder, whether or not similar defects or irregularities
are waived in the case of other stockholders. No tender of Shares will be deemed
to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities have been cured
or waived. None of the Company, the Purchaser, Dendrite, the Dealer Manager, the
Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to
give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification. Subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, the Purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of
the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the instructions thereto)
will be final and binding.

     Appointment.  By executing the Letter of Transmittal (or delivering an
Agent's Message) as set forth above, a tendering stockholder irrevocably
appoints designees of the Purchaser as such stockholder's proxies, each with
full power of substitution, in the manner set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, to the full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the
Shares tendered by such stockholder and accepted for payment by the Purchaser
(and with respect to any and all other Shares or other securities issued or
issuable in respect of such Shares). All such proxies will be considered coupled
with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment will be effective
when, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts such Shares for
payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior proxies given by such
stockholder with respect to such Shares (and such other Shares and securities)
will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent proxies may be given
nor any subsequent written consent executed by such stockholder (and, if given
or executed, will not be deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. The
designees of the Purchaser will, with respect to the Shares (and such other
Shares and securities) for which the appointment is effective, be empowered to
exercise all voting and other rights of such stockholder as they in their sole
discretion may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of the Company's
stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, by written consent in
lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. The Shares will not be deemed to be
validly tendered, unless the Purchaser is able to exercise full voting rights
with respect to such Shares (and such other Shares and securities), except the
Purchaser may in its sole discretion waive such requirement.

     Subsequent Offering Period.  The Purchaser will provide for a subsequent
offering period in connection with the Offer if, at the expiration of the Offer,
all of the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied or waived but the number
of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer constitutes less than
90% of outstanding Shares. Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, the Purchaser will extend its offer to purchase Shares beyond the
expiration date for a subsequent offering period not to exceed 20 business days
(the "Subsequent Offering Period"), if, among other things, at the expiration
date of the Offer, (i) all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
waived but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer
constitute less than 90% of the outstanding Shares, and (ii) the Purchaser
accepts for payment, and promptly pays for, all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the Offer. SHARES TENDERED DURING THE
SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD MAY NOT BE WITHDRAWN. The Purchaser will immediately
accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all validly tendered Shares as they
are received during the Subsequent Offering Period. If the Purchaser provides
for a Subsequent Offering Period, it will be effected by the Purchaser by giving
oral or written notice of the subsequent offering period to the Depositary and
making a public announcement to that effect on the next

business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. The acceptance for
payment by the Purchaser of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described
above will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering stockholder and
the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

UNDER U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, THE DEPOSITARY MAY BE REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD
ON PAYMENTS MADE TO CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS PURSUANT TO THE OFFER. SEE SECTION 5
("CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES") BELOW.

     Tendering Rights.  The Company and Equiserve Trust Company amended the
Rights Agreement on May 9, 2003 to provide that (x) in connection with the Offer
and the Merger, neither Dendrite nor the Purchaser shall be deemed to be an
Acquiring Person for the purposes of the Rights Agreement, and (y) a
Distribution Date shall not be deemed to have occurred as a result of the
approval, execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement or the
announcement, commencement or consummation of the Offer or the consummation of
the Merger.

     In order to validly tender Shares, a stockholder must tender the associated
Right. Until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the
Rights will be evidenced by the Share Certificates registered in the names of
the holders thereof, and until a Distribution Date, the tender of a Share will
constitute a tender of the associated Right. Upon a Distribution Date separate
Rights Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of Shares as of the
close of business on the Distribution Date (and to each initial record holder of
certain Shares originally issued after the Distribution Date), and such separate
Rights Certificates alone will thereafter evidence the Rights.

3.  ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment) and the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser will accept for payment,
and will pay for, all Shares validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date
and not properly withdrawn promptly after the later to occur of (i) the
Expiration Date, or (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to
the Offer set forth in Section 14 ("Certain Conditions to the Offer"). Subject
to applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay acceptance for
payment of, or payment for, tendered Shares in order to comply in whole or in
part with any applicable law.

     In all cases (including during any subsequent offering period), the
Purchaser will pay for Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer only after timely receipt by the Depositary of:

     - the Share Certificates or timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry
       Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
       Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry
       Transfer Facility") pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2;

     - the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed
       and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees (as described
       below under the caption "Signature Guarantees") or, in the case of a
       book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message; and

     - any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

     Accordingly, stockholders tendering Shares in the Offer may be paid at
different times, depending upon when Share Certificates or Book-Entry
Confirmations with respect to the Shares are actually received by the
Depositary.

     The per Share consideration paid to any stockholder in the Offer will be
the highest per Share consideration paid to any other stockholder in the Offer.

     The term "Agent's Message" means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation, that states that such Book-Entry Transfer Facility has
received an express acknowledgment from the participant in such Book-Entry

Transfer Facility tendering the Shares, that such participant has received and
agrees to be bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that the
Purchaser may enforce such agreement against such participant.

     For purposes of the Offer (including during any Subsequent Offering Period
(as defined in Section 2)), the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for
payment (and thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral
or written notice to the Depositary of the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of
such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer, payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will be made by
deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as
agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from the
Purchaser and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE PURCHASER PAY INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE
PRICE FOR SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

     If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment for any reason pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Offer, Share Certificates evidencing
unpurchased Shares will be returned (and, if Share Certificates are submitted
for more Shares than are tendered, new certificates for the Shares not tendered
will be sent), in each case without expense to the tendering stockholder (or, in
the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account
at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares"), such Shares will be credited to
an account maintained at such Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as
practicable following the expiration or termination of the Offer.

4.  WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
may also be withdrawn at any time after July 15, 2003.

     For a withdrawal of Shares to be effective, a written or facsimile
transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at
its address set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase. Any such
notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares
to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the
registered holder of such Shares, if different from that of the person who
tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn
have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to
the physical release of such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on
such Share Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s)
on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution,
unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for
book-entry transfer as described in Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering
Shares"), any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn
Shares.

     All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, whose determination will be final and binding. None of the
Purchaser, Dendrite, the Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent
or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects
or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure
to give any such notification.

     Withdrawals of tendered Shares may not be rescinded without the Purchaser's
consent and any Shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not to have
been validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may
be re-tendered at any time prior to the Expiration Date by following one of the
procedures described in Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares").

5.  CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following is a summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the receipt of cash by stockholders
whose Shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the
Merger. The discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that might be relevant to stockholders. The discussion is based
on current law, which is subject to change possibly with retroactive effect. The
discussion applies only to stockholders who hold Shares as capital assets, and
may not apply to Shares received in connection with the exercise of employee
stock options, restricted stock units or otherwise as compensation, or to
certain types of stockholders (such as dealers in securities or currencies,
financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment
trusts, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, persons holding Shares as a
part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a
straddle, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities holdings, persons liable for alternative minimum
tax, or investors in pass-through entities) who may be subject to special rules.
This discussion does not discuss the federal income tax consequences to any
stockholder who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident alien
individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership or foreign estate or trust,
and does not address any aspect of state, local or foreign tax laws.

     Sales of Shares pursuant to the Offer (and the receipt of cash by
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger) will be taxable transactions
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
tendering stockholder will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by the stockholder
pursuant to the Offer (or the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger)
and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares tendered by the stockholder and
purchased pursuant to the Offer (or cancelled pursuant to the Merger). Gain or
loss will be calculated separately for each block of Shares (i.e., Shares
acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) tendered and purchased
pursuant to the Offer (or cancelled pursuant to the Merger).

     Capital gains of individuals derived with respect to capital assets held
for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

     Under the U.S. federal backup withholding tax rules, unless an exemption
applies, the Depositary will be required to withhold, and will withhold, 30% of
all cash payments to which a holder of Shares is entitled pursuant to the Offer
(or the Merger), unless the stockholder provides a tax identification number
(social security number, in the case of an individual, or employer
identification number, in the case of other stockholders), certifies that such
number is correct, and otherwise complies with such backup withholding tax
rules. Each stockholder should complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9
included as part of the letter of transmittal, in order to provide the
information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding tax, unless
an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the
Depositary. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of
the backup withholding can be credited against the U.S. federal income tax
liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the
required information is given to the Internal Revenue Service. If backup
withholding results in an overpayment of tax, the stockholder upon filing an
income tax return can obtain a refund.

STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

6.  PRICE RANGE OF SHARES; DIVIDENDS

     The Shares have been listed and traded on The Nasdaq National Market System

     On April 17, 2003, the last full trading day before the date Dendrite made
its unsolicited proposal to the Company's Board of Directors for a merger, the
closing price of a Share was $2.26. On May 9, 2003, the last full trading day
prior to the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement and of the
Purchaser's intention to commence the Offer, the closing price per Share as
reported on Nasdaq was $2.58. On May 15, 2003, the last full trading day prior
to the date of the commencement of the Offer, the closing price per Share as
reported on Nasdaq was $3.14.

     The Company has not paid cash dividends since its inception. The Company
does not expect to begin paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The
Company's Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with CapitalSource Finance LLC
(the "CapitalSource Facility") prohibits the payment of dividends without prior
lender approval.

STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN A CURRENT MARKET QUOTATION FOR THE SHARES.

10.  BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

  BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     During late 2000, Dendrite identified the Company as a potential
acquisition candidate and retained Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. to act as a
financial advisor to Dendrite in connection with its possible acquisition of the
Company. In early 2001, Dendrite's advisor contacted the Company and/or its
advisor(s) to discuss Dendrite's interest in exploring a potential strategic
transaction with the Company. On May 10, 2001, Dendrite and the Company entered
into a Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "2001 Agreement") and engaged in subsequent
informal discussions regarding a potential business combination.

     In May 2002, Dendrite and the Company held discussions concerning a
possible combination of the two companies. Dendrite also conducted limited due
diligence on the Company during this period. The parties did not reach an
agreement on terms for a transaction, but left the door open for future
discussions.

     In July of 2002, Dendrite was contacted by the Company and informed that
the Company had retained Alterity Partners, LLC ("Alterity") as its new
investment advisor to assist the Company in evaluating its strategic
alternatives and potentially selling one or more of the Company's divisions and
that the Company would like Dendrite to be involved in the process. As part of
that process, a new Mutual Confidentiality and Non-disclosure Agreement, dated
August 14, 2002 (the "2002 Confidentiality Agreement") was entered into between
Dendrite and the Company.

     In the fall of 2002, Dendrite was contacted by Alterity regarding
Dendrite's interest in acquiring one or both of the Company's two divisions (the
Technology Division and the Interactive Marketing Division (the "IM Division")).
Alterity informed Dendrite that the Company was soliciting interest for each
division or both divisions together from numerous parties. Dendrite indicated it
was interest in participating in the process and thereafter participated in
several due diligence sessions organized by the Company and/or its advisors.

     By letter dated November 12, 2002, Alterity invited Dendrite to submit a
final proposal and provided bid guidelines for the Company's Technology Division
and by letter November 19, 2002, Alterity invited Dendrite to submit a final
proposal and provided bid guidelines for the Company's IM Division. In response
to Alterity's letters inviting proposals, Dendrite, by letter, dated November
25, 2002, submitted a proposal to acquire the Company's International IM
Division and its International Technology Division. Dendrite's proposal was
declined by the Company.

     After the passage of a few months without an announcement of a transaction
by the Company, Dendrite, by letter dated February 7, 2003, wrote to the Company
seeking consent, as required by the standstill provision in the 2002
Confidentiality Agreement, to make a proposal to acquire the Company pursuant to
a merger for $1.60 per Share to be paid in Dendrite common stock, subject to
certain specified contingencies. In the February 7, 2002 letter Dendrite also
noted that it would be amenable to offering a portion of the consideration in
cash. The Company informally advised Dendrite that it was not prepared to
consider Dendrite's offer at that time.

     In response, Dendrite, by letter, dated February 10, 2003, wrote to the
Company and indicated that Dendrite would be willing to increase the purchase
price by $1 million and to pay 20% of the price, approximately $5 million, in
cash. By letter dated February 11, 2003, Dendrite wrote to the Company
requesting a formal response. In the letter, Dendrite indicated it would be
prepared to increase its valuation of the Company to $29 million, with 20%
payable in cash and the remainder in Dendrite common stock. By letter

dated February 19, 2003, the Company advised Dendrite that it was not prepared
to pursue the proposal set forth in Dendrite's February 11, 2003 letter. By
letter dated March 3, 2003, Dendrite revised its proposal noting that it would
be willing to adjust the mix of cash and stock with up to 40% paid in cash. By
letter dated March 10, 2003, the Company reiterated its position outlined in the
February 19, 2003 letter.

     On March 16, 2003, Cegedim and the Company publicly announced that they had
executed a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") and related agreements
for Cegedim's acquisition of the Company's IM Division.

     On March 23, 2003, Patrick Zenner, a member of Dendrite's Board of
Directors, notified Mr. Yetter and Douglas Donahue of Alterity to inform the
Company of Dendrite's intention to make a bid for the Company.

     On March 24, 2003, Dendrite sent a letter to the Company affirming its
previous bid to acquire all of the Company for cash and equity consideration of
$29 million and remove certain contingencies. Dendrite noted that under its
offer it would fund the obligations of the Company, including those to be paid
from the Cegedim proceeds. This letter led to discussions between certain
executives of Dendrite and the Company held in the later part of that week and
to Dendrite scheduling a due diligence trip to the Company's offices the
following week.

     On April 4, 2003, Dendrite submitted its offer to purchase the Company
during a meeting among executives of the two companies held in New Jersey.
Dendrite proposed that is would acquire all the issued and outstanding stock of
the Company for 2,800,000 shares of Dendrite common stock plus $6 million in
cash, which offer then represented approximately $30.9 million for all the
issued and outstanding Shares. At the meeting, Dendrite noted that it would be
willing to offer a set value with the number of shares thereby fluctuating. The
letter noted that in addition to such purchase price, Dendrite would assume the
liabilities and fund the obligations of the Company and that the only
contingencies would be those absolutely required in a transaction of such
nature. After submitting this offer, Dendrite was advised that the Company's
Board would make a decision on April 7, 2003 or April 8, 2003. The Company
advised Dendrite that the Company's Board of Directors would review the bids and
make a decision early the following week.

     On April 7, 2003, Dendrite was informed that it would be provided a form of
agreement and plan of merger to review and mark-up, and that the mark-up would
be considered by the Company's Board as part of its evaluation and comparison of
the offers.

     On April 8, 2003, just prior to Dendrite submitting the mark-up, Mr.
Zaffaroni, President and Chief Operating Officer of Dendrite, was informed by
Mr. Yetter that the Company's Board of Directors would likely find that
Dendrite's offer was not sufficient. Mr. Zaffaroni then spoke with Mr. Donohue
of Alterity and when Mr. Zaffaroni suggested that Dendrite might be willing to
pay $33 million, he was told to write it up as a formal offer.

     On April 9, 2003, Dendrite submitted the mark-up and volunteered that the
Company might want to request a mechanism whereby the Company stockholders would
be allowed to select either cash or stock in whatever percentage they desired,
with an aggregate cap on cash payments of $6 million. The mark-up retained a
provision that would require Dendrite to additionally purchase all restricted
stock units and all options at the same price per Share offered in the merger,
minus the exercise price per share on the options. The cover letter accompanying
the mark-up left open the possibility for a price increase.

     Subsequently, on April 9, 2003, after making calls to the Company and
Alterity, Dendrite learned that the Company's Board of Directors would likely
find that Dendrite's offer was not sufficient. By e-mail, Dendrite revised its
proposal and offered to pay $35 million, all cash.

     Later on April 9, 2003, Dendrite received an e-mail from the Company
wherein the Company requested that Dendrite provide its best and final bid in
writing by 12:00 noon the next day. The letter continued that "Since timing is
of critical importance, and further delays introduce an element of unacceptable
risk to our shareholders, we will provide to you this evening a draft contract
which provides for a cash tender offer to be followed by a merger and reflects
the level of certainty of closing that our board is looking for." On the evening

of April 9, 2002, Dendrite received the proposed draft contract for a cash
tender followed by a merger (the "Draft Tender Agreement").

     By e-mail dated April 10, 2003, Dendrite advised the Company that it was
ready, willing and able to close expeditiously on the offer submitted and would
be open to converting that to a tender offer followed by a merger and to
likewise close expeditiously on that transaction. Dendrite was informed by the
Company that a decision would be made within the next couple of days.

     On April 12, 2003, Cegedim and the Company announced that they had executed
a merger agreement (the "Cegedim Merger Agreement") for the acquisition of the
Company for $2.30 per share pursuant to a tender offer followed by a back-end
merger.

     On April 21, 2003, Dendrite submitted an offer to the Company and issued a
press release announcing that Dendrite made a proposal to the Company's Board of
Directors to acquire all of the outstanding Shares at $2.50 per Share and had
filed a complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court seeking to invalidate the
Cegedim Merger Agreement and the termination and expense fees payable to
Cegedim. The April 21, 2003, complaint filed by Dendrite in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County (the "Delaware Action")
also sought to enjoin the transaction contemplated in the Cedegim Merger
Agreement. On April 21, 2003, Dendrite also filed with the Court a motion for
expedited proceedings.

     On April 21, 2003, the Company notified Dendrite that the Company's Board
of Directors had held a telephonic meeting and authorized discussions and
negotiations with Dendrite in order to fully understand Dendrite's bid.

     On April 22, 2003, the Company issued a press release announcing its
receipt of Dendrite's offer and stating that the Company's Board of Directors
had authorized the Company's management to conduct talks with Dendrite to "fully
understand" Dendrite's bid to buy the Company.

     On April 22, 2003, counsel for the Company and counsel for Dendrite began
discussions and negotiations regarding a process for the parties to move forward
with discussions and negotiations of Dendrite's offer. Various proposals were
made, including a proposal that the Company, Dendrite, and Cegedim jointly agree
to a process. On April 26, 2003, Dendrite informed the Company that it would
agree to the proposed process, but subsequently on April 26, 2003, the Company
informed Dendrite that Cegedim would not agree to the proposed process.

     On April 23, 2003, the Court granted Dendrite's motion for expedited
proceedings, and scheduled a hearing on Dendrite's motion for a preliminary
injunction for May 12, 2003. The Court also granted a similar motion that was
made in three actions that had been filed on behalf of stockholders of the
Company (the "Stockholder Actions").

     On April 24, 2003, in connection with the discussions regarding the
proposed process, the Company's counsel forwarded to Dendrite's counsel for
review and consideration, a form of Agreement and Plan of Merger, Company
Disclosure Schedule, Capitalization Schedule and interim financial information.
The proposed form of Agreement and Plan of Merger contained changes from the
Cegedim Merger Agreement that were being requested by the Company.

     On April 26, 2003, the parties to the Delaware Action began producing
documents in response to discovery requests. On April 28, 2003, depositions of
certain officers and directors of the parties to the Delaware Action began.
Written discovery and depositions continued through the week of May 4, 2003.

     On April 28, 2003, Dendrite provided to the Company's counsel a draft of a
proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, which consisted of the Cegedim Merger
Agreement with minor changes requested by Dendrite. On April 29, 2003, Dendrite
provided to the Company's counsel a revised draft of the proposed Company
Disclosure Schedule based on the draft of those Schedules provided by the
Company's counsel on March 24, 2003.

     On April 28, 2003, Mr. Zaffaroni of Dendrite contacted the Chief Executive
Officer of IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS") to determine if IMS would attempt in
some manner to object to the proposed

transaction between the Company and Dendrite. As a follow-up to that
conversation, counsel for Dendrite spoke with the general counsel of IMS.
Subsequently, IMS was contacted by the Company and the Company, Dendrite and IMS
entered into a letter agreement dated May 8, 2003, pursuant to which (i) IMS
acknowledged that it did not object to the transactions contemplated between the
Company and Dendrite, (ii) the parties agreed that upon consummation of the
transactions, that the Distribution Agreement, dated August 31, 2000, between
the Company and IMS would be amended by deleting Section 2.16, which contains
certain non-competition provisions, (iii) IMS was granted an option, which may
be exercised at any time for a period of six months following the consummation
of the transactions, to extend the Cross License Agreement for Pharbase on the
same terms as currently provided in the such Cross License, (iv) the parties
agreed to enter into an extension of the Xponent Data License upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (vi)
Dendrite and the Company agreed to pay IMS (A) $2 million plus (B) the present
value of $7 million (discounted from January 1, 2005 at a discount rate of 6.5%)
in full satisfaction of certain liabilities of the Company under the
Distribution Agreement, such amount to be paid at the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     From April 28, 2003 though May 7, 2003, the companies negotiated the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the
Dendrite Disclosure Schedules.

     On May 2, 2003, Dendrite provided to the Company a draft of a proposed
agreement to settle the Delaware Action (as finally executed, the "Settlement
Agreement"). From May 2, 2003 through May 8, 2003, the companies, through their
respective counsel, negotiated the terms and conditions of the Settlement
Agreement.

     On May 6, 2003, Mr. Yetter sent an e-mail to Mr. Bailye, the Chairman and
CEO of Dendrite and Mr. Zaffaroni, the President of Dendrite, notifying them
that the Company was requesting that Dendrite provide its true best and final
bid by 12:00 noon on Thursday, May 8, 2003.

     On May 7, 2003, Dendrite served its opening brief in the Delaware Action in
support of its motion for a preliminary injunction. Also on May 7, 2003, two of
the plaintiffs in the Stockholder Actions served a brief in support of their
motion for a preliminary injunction.

     On May 8, 2003 Dendrite submitted its offer for $2.83 per Share and
informed the Company, among other things, that its offer was based on the Merger
Agreement, Schedules and Settlement Agreement worked out between the companies
and approved by Dendrite's Board of Directors, and that Dendrite was prepared to
sign the agreements when approved by the Company's Board.

     On May 9, 2003, Dendrite executed the Merger Agreement, the Settlement
Agreement and provided the Company's counsel with signature pages of the Merger
Agreement that could be released upon approval of the same by the Company. In
addition, as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, Dendrite's counsel
executed a Notice of Dismissal of the Delaware Action and Dendrite executed a
release of the Company and its directors to be effective upon the closing of the
Offer. On May 9, 2003, the Company notified Dendrite that Merger Agreement and
Settlement Agreement had been approved by the Company's Board of Directors and
had been executed on behalf of the Company and the necessary signature pages
were delivered.

     On May 9, 2003, Dendrite and the Company informed the Court in the Delaware
Action and counsel for the plaintiffs in the Stockholder Action that they had
executed the Merger Agreement and both Dendrite and the plaintiffs in the
Stockholder Actions withdrew their motions for a preliminary injunction.

     On May 13, 2003, Cegedim's counsel submitted a letter to the Company's
counsel indicating a willingness by Cegedim to purchase all of the Shares at a
price per Share of $3.15. On May 14, 2003, the Company issued a press release
indicating the receipt of the proposal and that the Company's management had
been authorized to enter into discussions and negotiations with Cegedim
regarding its proposal.

     On May 15, 2003, Dendrite submitted an offer to the Company to acquire all
of the outstanding Shares at $3.22 per share and offered to advance up to
$5,000,000 to the Company as a bridge loan to provide short-term liquidity,
which funds would be used to pay off the CapitalSource Facility (as defined
below) and for general working capital purposes along with a proposed form of
Amendment No. 1 to the Merger Agreement and form

of Promissory Note. On May 15, 2003, Dendrite was informed that the Company's
Board of Directors planned to meet on Friday, May 16, 2003 to consider the May
15, 2003 proposal. At the request of the Company, the proposed bridge loan has
increased from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.

  THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
filed as an exhibit to this Offer to Purchase on Schedule TO (the "Schedule TO")
filed by the Purchaser and Dendrite with the SEC in connection with the Offer.
Such summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.

     The Offer.  The Merger Agreement provides for the commencement of the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the fifth
business day following the date of the Merger Agreement (including the date of
the Merger Agreement). The Purchaser has commenced the Offer in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement.

     The Merger Agreement provides that the obligation of the Purchaser to
consummate the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is subject to the conditions set forth
in Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement and as set forth in this Offer to Purchase
(any of which may be waived in whole or in part by the Purchaser in its sole
discretion, except that the Purchaser may not waive the Minimum Condition
without the prior written approval of the Company).

     Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not
extend the Expiration Date of the Offer beyond the initial Expiration Date,
except (A) as required by applicable law, (B) that if, immediately prior to the
Expiration Date of the Offer (as it may be extended), the Shares tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute less than 90% of the outstanding
Shares, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, on one occasion, extend the
Offer for a period not to exceed an aggregate of ten business days,
notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of such
Expiration Date, or (C) that if any condition to the Offer has not been
satisfied or waived, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the
Expiration Date for one or more periods but no later than August 1, 2003 without
the Company's prior written consent; provided that: (1) if requested by the
Company, the Purchaser shall, on two occasions, extend the Expiration Date of
the Offer for a period not to exceed an aggregate of ten business days, if any
condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived and (2) the Offer may be
extended in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant
to the Offer so as to comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.

     Directors.  The Merger Agreement provides that if the Minimum Condition is
satisfied, promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Shares
pursuant to the Offer, Dendrite shall be entitled to designate such number of
directors (the "Dendrite Designees"), rounded up to the next whole number (and,
to the extent permitted by the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the class to which each such director is assigned), on the
Company's Board of Directors as is equal to the product of (1) the total number
of directors on such Board of Directors (after giving effect to any increase in
size of such Board of Directors to effect Dendrite's representation on such
Board of Directors as set forth in the Merger Agreement) and (2) the percentage
that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser at such time
(including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
then outstanding, provided that in no event shall the Dendrite Designees
constitute less than a majority of the Company's entire Board of Directors.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that, at all times prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, at least one member of the Company's Board of Directors is an
individual who was a director of the Company on the date of the Merger Agreement
(the "Continuing Director"), except that if at any time prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, no Continuing Director then remains, then the Company's
Board of Directors shall designate an individual to serve on the Company's Board
of Directors who is not an officer, employee or affiliate of the Company,
Dendrite or the Purchaser, who will be deemed to be a Continuing Director for
all purposes.

     The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser will be
merged into the Company, the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser will
cease and the Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger
will become effective when a certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time specified in
the certificate of merger as Dendrite and the Company shall agree.

     The Merger Agreement provides that the directors of the Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and that the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger Agreement also provides that
the certificate of incorporation of The Company as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger Agreement further provides that the
by-laws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger will be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

     Conversion of Securities.  The Merger Agreement provides that as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Dendrite, the Purchaser, the Company or holders of any of the
securities of the Company:

     - each Share that is held in the treasury of the Company and each Share
       that is owned by Dendrite, Purchaser or the Company ("Ineligible
       Shares"), will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to
       exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor; and

     - each issued and outstanding Share, other than Appraisal Shares (as
       defined below) and Ineligible Shares, will be converted into the right to
       receive the Merger Consideration (as such term is defined below), upon
       the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Share.

     - the "Merger Consideration" into which each issued and outstanding Share,
       other than Appraisal Shares and Ineligible Shares, is the Offer Price of
       $2.83 per Share.

     Stock Options.  The Merger Agreement provides that in accordance with the
terms of the Company's stock options plans, immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger all rights to acquire Shares under each option, whether
vested or unvested, then outstanding and unexercised under the Company stock
option plans shall be canceled, and any holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Corporation cash equal to the product of (i) the
number of Shares previously subject to such holder's rights under the Company
stock option plans and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of each stock option held by holder under the
Company stock option plans, less any required withholding taxes.

     Restricted Stock Units.  The Merger Agreement provides that immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger all outstanding restricted stock units
whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, and any holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive at the Effective Time of the Merger from the Company or as
soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than 10 days after the

     - otherwise commit to do, or take any action or omit to take any action

     Stockholders Meetings.  In the event that, following the acceptance for
payment of and payment for Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
Section 253 of the DGCL is inapplicable and unavailable to effectuate the
Merger, the Company shall establish, prior to or as soon as practicable
following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Special Meeting") for the purpose of considering the
approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such other
matters as may in the reasonable judgment of the Company be appropriate for
consideration at the Company Special Meeting. Subject to the Company's right, to
withhold, withdraw, modify, change or fail to make its recommendations in favor
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company's Board of
Directors shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Company shall
include such recommendation in its Proxy Statement. Unless the Company's Board
of Directors shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified, changed or failed to make
its recommendations in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the
vote or consent of stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     No Solicitation.  The Merger Agreement provides that from the date of the
Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time of the Merger and the
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company and its representatives shall
not (i) solicit or initiate any offer or proposal (other than an offer or
proposal made by Dendrite or its subsidiaries) for a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, liquidation or other business combination involving the
Company or the acquisition or purchase of over 50% of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or all or substantially all of the
Company's assets (an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information relating to the
Company or its subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records
of the Company or its subsidiaries to, any person (other than Dendrite or its
representatives) concerning an Acquisition Proposal, provided that, in each
case, if and to the extent that (A) the Company's Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) and (B) the Company's Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's counsel, that the failure
to engage in such discussions or negotiations or provide such information or
access would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of
Directors under applicable law, then the Company may participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal, provide non-public
information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, and afford access
to the properties, books or records of the Company and its subsidiaries. Upon
its receipt thereof, except to the extent prohibited by nondisclosure agreements
in effect as of the date hereof, the Company shall promptly provide Dendrite
with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal received and a written statement
with respect to any non-written Acquisition Proposal received, which statement
shall include the identity of the parties making the Acquisition Proposal and
the terms thereof, and shall promptly advise Dendrite of any material
modification or proposed modification thereto. A "Superior Proposal" shall mean
a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Company's Board of Directors
believes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisor
and taking into account all factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors,
including the likelihood that any transaction will be consummated, is more
favorable to the Company's stockholders as compared to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any alternative proposal offer
by Dendrite in response thereto).

     Except as described below, the Company may not (I) withhold, withdraw,
modify or change in a manner adverse to Dendrite, or fail to make, its
recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated hereby or (II) approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's counsel, that the failure to withhold, withdraw, modify or change
its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated thereby or the
failure to approve or recommend such Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be,
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of
Directors under applicable law, then the Company's Board of Directors under the
applicable law may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation of the

transactions contemplated thereby and/or approve or recommend such Acquisition
Proposal, but in the case of approval or recommendation of an Acquisition
Proposal only (i) after providing written notice to Dendrite advising Dendrite
that the Company's Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying, to the extent not prohibited by the provisions of nondisclosure
agreements in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have not been
waived by the counterparty thereto, the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the individual, corporation, partnership, firm, limited
liability company, joint venture, association, joint stock company, trust,
unincorporated organization, governmental authority or other entity (for
purposes of this section collectively referred to as "Person") making such
Superior Proposal, (ii) if the Person making such Superior Proposal has any
right (including, without limitation, under any nondisclosure agreement in
effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement) that would prohibit the Company
from disclosing to Dendrite the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, such
Person has waived in writing such right, and (iii) if Dendrite does not within
three (3) business days after Dendrite's receipt of such notice, deliver in
writing to the Company an improved proposal that the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's counsel, to be
at least as favorable to the Company's stockholders as the competing Superior
Proposal. Dendrite hereby waives any right it has, and any obligation the
Company has (including, without limitation under the Confidentiality Agreement
(as defined below)), that would prohibit the Company from disclosing to any
Person making an Acquisition Proposal the material terms and conditions of any
improved proposal delivered by Dendrite in response to such Acquisition Proposal
and the fact that it is Dendrite making the improved proposal.

     Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company's Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
or from making any disclosure required by applicable law.

     In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the Company shall cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any third
party (other than Dendrite) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, except the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such parties in possession of confidential information about the
Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all such information in the possession
of any such Person or in the possession of any representative of any such
Person.

     Termination of Cegedim Merger Agreement.  Simultaneously with the execution
of the Merger Agreement, (i) the Company terminated the Cegedim Merger
Agreement, and (ii) Dendrite paid a termination fee of $1,095,000, that was due
under the Cegedim Merger Agreement as a result of such termination. The Company
and Dendrite also executed a Settlement Agreement, as required by the Merger
Agreement, whereby certain litigation initiated by Dendrite against the Company
was suspended pending the closing of the Merger, at which time such litigation
would be dismissed by Dendrite.

     Best Efforts.  The Merger Agreement requires each of Dendrite, the
Purchaser and the Company to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including using its best efforts: (i) to obtain, in addition to securing
approvals and termination of any waiting period specified below, any licenses
and permits as are required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) to effect, in addition
to securing approvals and termination of any waiting period specified below, all
necessary registrations and filings; (iii) to defend, resolve or settle any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, whether
brought by private parties or governmental authorities or officials, challenging
the Merger Agreement or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated
thereby; (iv) to furnish to each other such information and assistance and to
consult with respect to the terms of any registration, filing, application or
undertaking as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing and
(v) to amend the Merger Agreement and take any related actions to change the
method with which Dendrite acquires the Company, including without limitation,
terminating the Offer and conducting a merger under Section 251 of the DGCL.

     Each party to the Merger Agreement shall (i) make all pre-merger filings
(if any) required of it or any of its affiliates under any applicable
requirements of any non-U.S. antitrust, competition, merger or investment
control or other pre-merger statutes or regulations ("Non-U.S. Merger Control
Regulations") in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than
fifteen calendar days following the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) comply at
the earliest practicable date and after consultation with the other parties
thereto with any request for additional information or documentary material
received by it or any of its affiliates from any applicable governmental
authority, (iii) cooperate with one another in connection with any filing under
any applicable Non-U.S. Merger Control Regulations, and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement initiated by any governmental authority and
(iv) use its best efforts to secure the termination of any waiting periods, and
the receipt of any clearances, approvals or confirmations from governmental
authorities under any applicable Non-U.S. Merger Control Regulations in order to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby at the earliest
possible date but in no event later than the termination date of the Merger
Agreement. For purposes of this section, without limiting the foregoing, best
efforts shall include the following: (A) proffer by Dendrite of its willingness
to agree to divest any and all of the businesses or assets of it or its
subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its subsidiaries, (B) Dendrite's
acceptance of an agreement to hold any subsidiary or asset separate, and/or (C)
Dendrite's agreement to amend or terminate such existing licenses or other
intellectual property agreements (other than a termination that would result in
a breach of a license or intellectual property agreement with a third party),
and to enter into such new licenses or other intellectual property agreements
(and, in each case, to enter into agreements with the relevant governmental
authorities giving effect thereto), as may be required in any proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, and whether required by any applicable
governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or any other agreement contemplated thereby.

     Director's and Officer's Indemnification and Insurance.  The Merger
Agreement provides that, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger:

          (a) The Surviving Corporation and Dendrite shall (i) indemnify and
     hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the Company
     and its subsidiaries (A) to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as
     of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to the Company's certificate of
     incorporation and bylaws as in existence on the date hereof (including for
     acts or omissions occurring in connection with the negotiation, approval,
     performance and termination, as applicable, of the Purchase Agreement dated
     as of March 16, 2003 between Cegedim and the Company, the Cegedim Merger
     Agreement, the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated thereby and the taking of any action or performance of any
     obligation related to, or in connection with, any proposal for the
     acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the
     Company) and (B) without limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent
     permitted by law, for any costs or expenses (including advancing attorney's
     fees and expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law) judgments, fines,
     losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
     connection with any proceeding, in each case arising out of, relating to or
     in connection with acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
     whether prior to or after the Effective Time of the Merger, and in the
     event of any such proceeding, Dendrite and the Surviving Corporation shall
     cooperate with the indemnified party in the defense of any such proceeding,
     (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
     Corporation's (or any successor's) certificate of incorporation and bylaws
     after the Effective Time of the Merger, a provision regarding the
     elimination of liability of directors and the indemnification of the
     indemnified parties which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
     the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in
     the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
     (iii) cause to be maintained for a period of at least six (6) years after
     the Effective Time of the Merger the Company's existing directors' and
     officers' liability insurance policy ("D&O Insurance"); provided that (V)
     Dendrite may substitute therefor policies with a reputable insurer of
     substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less
     advantageous to the indemnified parties, (W) if the existing D&O Insurance
     expires or is canceled during such period, Dendrite and the Surviving
     Corporation will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
     substantially similar D&O Insurance

     with a reputable insurer, (X) in no event shall Dendrite or the Surviving
     Corporation be required to expend on an annual basis more than 275% of the
     last annual premiums paid by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
     Time of the Merger to maintain or procure D&O Insurance pursuant to the
     Merger Agreement and (Y) if the annual premium of such D&O Insurance would
     exceed the maximum premium amount, Dendrite or the Surviving Corporation
     shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy
     with the greatest coverage available for an annual cost equal to but not
     exceeding the maximum premium amount; and provided further, however, that
     (Z) the obligations of Dendrite and the Surviving Corporation under the
     Merger Agreement to maintain the D&O Insurance will be deemed to be
     satisfied if Dendrite causes the Surviving Corporation to procure
     (including the timely payment of all required costs and premiums) the 6
     year Discovery Period (as such term is defined in the D&O Insurance policy)
     available to the Company under the D&O Insurance policy.

          (b) Dendrite shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
     honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
     Corporation to honor the covenants relating to indemnity specified in the
     provisions governing D&O Insurance of the Merger Agreement.

          (c) The Company shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
     reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any indemnified party
     in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations in the applicable
     provision of the Merger Agreement.

          (d) The rights of each indemnified party shall be in addition to, and
     not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified party may have
     under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any other
     indemnification arrangements, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions
     governing D&O Insurance shall survive consummation of the Merger and
     expressly are intended to benefit each of the indemnified parties.

          (e) In the event Dendrite, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
     respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
     other person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or
     entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
     substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in
     either case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
     assigns of Dendrite or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
     assume the relevant obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

          (f) Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company may procure
     (including the timely payment of all required costs and premiums) the 6
     year Discovery Period (as such term is defined in the D&O Insurance policy)
     available to the Company under its D&O Insurance policy. The obligations of
     Dendrite and the Surviving Corporation under the Merger Agreement will be
     deemed satisfied if the Company procures such 6 year Discovery Period
     (including the timely payment of all required costs and premiums) available
     to the Company under its D&O Insurance policy.

     Continuity of Employment and Benefits.  Prior to or at the Effective Time
of the Merger, Dendrite has agreed to not take any action to cause the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee, and
neither the Company nor its subsidiaries shall be under any obligation to
terminate any employee prior to or at the Effective Time of the Merger.

     At the Effective Time of the Merger and for at least one year thereafter,
Dendrite shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, the employees of the Surviving
Corporation with compensation and welfare and pension benefits that in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to those provided to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing therein shall be construed to require Dendrite or the
Surviving Corporation to employ any employee or to limit or restrict the ability
of Dendrite or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any
employees or to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan following the Effective Time
of the Merger. Dendrite shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
credit, to the extent allowed, the continuing employees for periods of services
with the Company and its subsidiaries for eligibility and vesting purposes under
any benefit plans of Dendrite or its affiliates in which the

employees are offered the opportunity to participate and (ii) credit, to the
extent allowed, the continuing employees for any amounts paid in the year in
which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of any deductibles or out of pocket
expenses incurred under any Benefit Plans.

     Dendrite has agreed to assume, or cause the Surviving Corporation to assume
certain Company severance policies (the "Severance Plans") and shall maintain
such policies, without adverse amendment thereto, for at least one year after
the Effective Time of the Merger, and shall make severance payments and pay
severance-related benefits to (i) any employee who is terminated by Dendrite or
the Surviving Corporation during such one-year period in accordance with the
terms of such policies and (ii) if required by applicable law or a Severance
Plan, any employee who does not accept employment with Dendrite or the Surviving
Corporation or objects to the transfer under local labor law, or whose
employment does not continue by operation of law.

     Conditions to the Merger.  The Merger Agreement provides that the
respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the closing date of the Merger of the
following conditions:

     - Purchaser shall have accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly
       tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn;

     - no order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree or ruling entered, issued,
       made or rendered by any court, administrative agency, arbitration
       tribunal or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction
       ("Order") of any nature that is in effect that restrains or prohibits the
       consummation of the Merger, provided that the parties invoking this
       condition shall have used their best efforts to have such Order vacated
       or denied, including complying with the covenants described under "Best
       Efforts" above; and

     - the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of
       outstanding Shares shall have been obtained, if Section 253 of the DGCL
       is unavailable and inapplicable to effect the Merger without a vote of
       the stockholders of the Company.

     Termination.  The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated thereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the consummation of
the Offer:

     - by mutual written consent of Dendrite and the Company, by action of their
       respective boards of directors;

     - by either the Company or Dendrite if the consummation of the Offer shall
       not have occurred on or before October 1, 2003; provided, however, that
       the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under this paragraph shall
       not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
       under the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of
       such consummation to occur on or before such date;

     - by either the Company or Dendrite if any governmental authority shall
       have issued an Order or taken any other action (which the parties to the
       Merger Agreement shall have used best efforts to resist, resolve or lift)
       permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
       transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such Order shall
       have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to
       terminate the Merger Agreement under this paragraph shall not be
       available to any party whose failure to comply with the covenants
       described under "Best Efforts" above has been the primary cause of such
       action or inaction;

     - by Dendrite if the Company's Board of Directors (i) shall withdraw, or
       modify or change in any manner materially adverse to Dendrite, its
       recommendation to the stockholders of the Company that they approve the
       transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (ii) shall approve
       or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) shall have failed to
       deliver the termination notice to Cegedim as required under the Merger
       Agreement;

     - by the Company if the Company's Board of Directors, subject to the
       non-solicitation provisions in the Merger Agreement, shall approve a
       Superior Proposal which has not been submitted by Dendrite;

     - by Dendrite, if neither Dendrite nor Purchaser is in material breach of
       its obligations under the Merger Agreement, and if (i) at any time that
       any of the representations and warranties of the Company become untrue or
       inaccurate such that the second bullet point under Section 14 ("Certain
       Conditions to the Offer") would not be satisfied, or (ii) there has been
       a breach on the part of the Company of any of its covenants or agreements
       contained in this Merger Agreement such that the third bullet point under
       Section 14 ("Certain Conditions to the Offer") would not be satisfied,
       and, in both case (i) and case (ii), such breach has not been cured
       within 30 days after notice to the Company from Dendrite;

     - by the Company, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
       the Merger Agreement, and if (i) at any time that any of the
       representations and warranties of Dendrite or Purchaser herein become
       untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of
       Dendrite or Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
       this Merger Agreement, and in both case (i) and case (ii), such breach
       has not been cured within 30 days after notice to Dendrite from the
       Company; or

     - by either the Company or Dendrite if the Offer shall have expired without
       Purchaser accepting for payment any Shares in compliance with the Merger
       Agreement.

     Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of the Merger
Agreement by either Dendrite or the Company in accordance with its terms, the
Merger Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of any party thereto, except for the Termination Fee (as
defined below), if applicable, and as otherwise set forth in the Merger
Agreement, and except that nothing set forth in the Merger Agreement shall
relieve any party from liability for intentional material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

     Fees and Expenses.  Except as set forth in the Merger Agreement all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

     Dendrite and the Company agree that the Company , in order to reimburse
Dendrite for the amount it paid with respect to the termination of the Cegedim
Merger Agreement, shall pay to Dendrite the sum of $1,095,000, (the "Termination
Fee") solely as follows: (i) if the Company shall terminate the Merger Agreement
after the Company's Board of Directors has approved a Superior Proposal which
has not been submitted by Dendrite; (ii) if Dendrite shall terminate the Merger
Agreement after the Company's Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified
or changed in any manner materially adverse to Dendrite, its recommendation to
the stockholders of the Company that they approve the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement; or (iii) if (A) either party shall terminate the Merger
Agreement if the consummation of the Offer shall not have occurred on or before
October 1, 2003 under circumstances where the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied, provided, however, that the right to so terminate shall not be
available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the Merger
Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of such consummation to
occur on or before such date, (B) at any time after the date of the Merger
Agreement and at or before the expiration of the Offer, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made public and not been withdrawn, and (C) within 12
months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company consummates an
Acquisition Proposal with a third party.

     Amendment.  The Merger Agreement provides that it may be amended, modified
and supplemented by a written instrument authorized and executed on behalf of
the parties at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

     The Company and Dendrite entered into a confidentiality agreement (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), effective as of August 14, 2002, in connection
with the consideration of a possible negotiated transaction regarding the
acquisition by Dendrite of certain assets of the Company. Under the
Confidentiality Agreement, Dendrite agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to
keep confidential any non-public information concerning the Company and the
Company agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to keep confidential any
non-public information concerning Dendrite. Dendrite has also agreed to certain
standstill restrictions until August 14,

2003. This summary and description of the material terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Confidentiality
Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this Schedule TO.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     On May 9, 2003 the Company entered into an amendment to the Rights
Agreement to (i) provide that the provisions of the Rights Agreement would not
be triggered by the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of either the Offer or the Merger and (ii) and to rescind the
exemption from the Rights Agreement with regard to the consummation of Cegedim's
previous tender offer and merger agreement by terminating Amendment No. 1 to the
Rights Agreement. This summary and description of the material terms of the
amendment to the Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to
such amendment, which was filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed by the
Company with the SEC in connection with the Offer.

IMS AGREEMENT

     In connection with the Merger Agreement, on May 8, 2003, IMS Health
Incorporated ("IMS"), the Company's former parent company, and the Company
entered into an agreement whereby (i) IMS acknowledged that it did not object to
the transactions contemplated between the Company and Dendrite, (ii) the parties
agreed that upon consummation of the transactions, that the Distribution
Agreement, dated August 31, 2000, between the Company and IMS would be amended
by deleting Section 2.16, which contains certain non-competition provisions,
(iii) IMS was granted an option, which may be exercised at any time for a period
of six month following the consummation of the transactions, to extend the Cross
License Agreement for Pharbase on the same terms as currently provided in the
such Cross License, (iv) the parties agreed to enter into an extension of the
Xponent Data License upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, and (vi) Dendrite and the Company agreed to pay IMS (A) $2
million plus (B) the present value of $7 million (discounted from January 1,
2005 at a discount rate of 6.5%) in full satisfaction of all liabilities of the
Company under Section 2.1(j) of the Distribution Agreement, such amount to be
paid at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     Through an arrangement with IMS, the Company has instant access to the
leading (based on the number of sales representatives that use it as a targeting
tool) physician prescribing database, Xponent(TM). This access enables the
Company to provide unique services to its clients that set the standard for the
targeting of marketing programs to physicians. The Company also provides
services from Pharbase(SM), the industry-leading (based upon number of licensed
customers) reference medical database used in pharmaceutical sales and
marketing. Pharbase(SM) is a syndicated database which is updated and validated
daily by a team of operators in each country, providing a level of accuracy that
cannot be achieved by in-house databases.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

     The Company, Dendrite and each member of the Company's Board of Directors
entered into a Settlement Agreement, dated May 9, 2003, that provides that the
lawsuit filed by Dendrite on April 21, 2003 against the Company and each member
of the Company's Board of Directors will be suspended pending the closing of the
Offer, at which time the lawsuit will be terminated and the claims thereunder
will be released.

11.  PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY AFTER THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

     Purpose of the Offer.  The purpose of the Offer is to enable Dendrite to
acquire as many outstanding Shares as possible as a first step in acquiring the
entire equity interest in the Company. The purpose of the Merger is for Dendrite
to acquire all remaining Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Dendrite.

     Under the DGCL, the approval of the Company's Board of Directors is
required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger. Unless the Merger is consummated
pursuant to the "short-form" Merger provisions under Section 253 of the DGCL
described below (in which case no vote of the holders of the outstanding Shares
is required), the only remaining

required corporate action of the Company is the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the approval of the Merger by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares. The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously (i)
determined that the terms of each of the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the holders of the Shares, and (ii) declared the
advisability of the Merger Agreement and recommended that the holders of the
Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and (if
required by applicable law) adopt the Merger Agreement.

     Under the DGCL, if the Purchaser acquires, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, the Purchaser will be able to
approve the Merger without a vote of the Company's stockholders. Accordingly, if
the Purchaser acquires at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, it will have
sufficient voting power to cause the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby without a vote of the
Company's stockholders. In such event, Dendrite, the Purchaser and the Company
have agreed in the Merger Agreement to take, at the request of the Purchaser,
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
without a meeting of the Company's stockholders. If, however, the Purchaser does
not acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise and a vote of the Company's stockholders is required under the DGCL, a
significantly longer period of time would be required to effect the Merger.

     Appraisal Rights.  APPRAISAL RIGHTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH
THE OFFER. However, if the Merger is consummated, stockholders who comply fully
with the appraisal procedures set forth in the DGCL, the relevant portions of
which are attached to this Offer to Purchase as Annex A, will be entitled to
receive cash for the fair value of their Shares, as determined pursuant to the
procedures presented by the DGCL. Merely voting against the Merger Agreement
will not perfect a stockholder's dissenters' rights. Stockholders are urged to
review carefully the dissenting stockholders' rights provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL, a description of which is provided below and the full text of which
is attached to this Offer to Purchase as Annex A and incorporated herein by
reference. The description below is not a complete statement of law pertaining
to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262 of the DGCL.

     STOCKHOLDERS WHO FAIL TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH THE APPLICABLE PROCEDURES
WILL FORFEIT THEIR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

     If the Merger is consummated, each holder of Shares who properly demands
and perfects appraisal rights and who has not voted in favor of the Merger will
be entitled to an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value
of such Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid. In determining the fair value, the Court may
consider all relevant factors. The judicially determined value could be more or
less than the consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger. Any judicial
determination of the fair value could be based upon considerations other than or
in addition to the market value of the Shares, including, among other things,
asset values and earning capacity. If any holder of Shares who demands appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal as provided in the DGCL, the Shares of
that stockholder will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in
accordance with the Merger Agreement. A stockholder may withdraw a demand for
appraisal by delivery to Purchaser of a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal and a statement of acceptance of the Merger.

     IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THESE PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW,
STOCKHOLDERS WHO ARE CONSIDERING DISSENTING FROM THE MERGER SHOULD CONSULT THEIR
OWN LEGAL COUNSEL.

     Going Private Transactions.  The SEC has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and
which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the Merger or another
business combination following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer in
which the Purchaser seeks to acquire the remaining Shares not held by it.
However, Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable to the Merger or any such other
business combination if the Merger or other business combination is consummated
within one year after the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer. If
applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial
information concerning the Company and certain

information relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the
consideration offered to minority stockholders in such transaction be filed with
the SEC and disclosed to stockholders prior to consummation of the transaction.

     Plans for the Company.  It is expected that, initially following the
Merger, the business and operations of the Company will be continued by the
Company substantially as they are currently being conducted. Dendrite will
continue to evaluate the business and operations of the Company during the
pendency of the Offer and after the consummation of the Offer and the Merger,
and will take such actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances then
existing. Dendrite intends to seek additional information about the Company
during this period.

     Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, Dendrite does not have any
present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in an extraordinary
corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation,
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any
material change in the Company's capitalization or dividend policy or any other
material change in the Company's corporate structure or business or composition
of the Company's Board of Directors, except that Dendrite intends to review the
composition of the boards of directors (or similar governing bodies) of the
Company and its subsidiaries and cause the election to such boards of directors
(or similar governing bodies) of certain of its representatives.

12.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     The Company has not paid dividends since its inception. The Company may
not, under the terms of the CapitalSource Facility declare, set aside, make or
pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or
any combination thereof) in respect of any of its capital stock, without prior
approval of CapitalSource.

13.  EFFECT OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR THE SHARES; EXCHANGE LISTING AND
     EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION.

     The purchase of Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer will reduce
the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the
number of holders of Shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and
market value of the remaining Shares held by the public.

     Depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the
Shares may no longer meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing and
may be delisted from Nasdaq. According to Nasdaq's published guidelines, Nasdaq
would consider delisting the Shares if, among other things, the total number of
stockholders is less than 400, or the number of publicly held Shares (exclusive
of holdings of officers, directors and their immediate families and other
concentrated holdings of ten percent or more) should fall below 1,100,000. If as
a result of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the
Shares no longer meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing and the
listing of the Shares is discontinued, the market for the Shares could be
adversely affected. If Nasdaq were to delist the Shares, it is possible that the
Shares would continue to trade on another securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be reported by
such exchange or through Nasdaq or other sources. The extent of the public
market therefor and the availability of such quotations would depend, however,
upon such factors as the number of stockholders and/or the aggregate market
value of the Shares remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market
in the Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of
registration under the Exchange Act as described below and other factors. The
Purchaser cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that
might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the
market price for or marketability of the Shares or whether it would cause future
market prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price.

     The Shares are currently "margin securities," as such term is defined under
the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which has the
effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the
collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors similar to those described
above regarding listing and market quotations, following the Offer it is
possible that the Shares might no longer

constitute "margin securities" for purposes of the margin regulations of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in which event such Shares
could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers.

     The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such
registration may be terminated in accordance with Section 12(g)(4) of the
Exchange Act upon application by the Company to the SEC if the Shares are not
listed on a national securities exchange and there are fewer than 300 record
holders. The termination of the registration of the Shares under the Exchange
Act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the
Company to holders of Shares and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of
the Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement in
connection with stockholders' meetings and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under
the Exchange Act with respect to "going private" transactions, no longer
applicable to the Shares. In addition, "affiliates" of the Company and persons
holding "restricted securities" of the Company may be deprived of the ability to
dispose of their Shares pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act. If registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, the
Shares would no longer be "margin securities" or be eligible for NYSE or Nasdaq
reporting. The Purchaser currently intends to seek to cause the Company to
terminate the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon after
consummation of the Offer as the requirements for termination of registration
are met.

14.  CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     Notwithstanding any other terms of the Offer and subject to the Merger
Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c)
under the Exchange Act (relating to the Purchaser's obligation to pay for or
return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the
restriction referred to above, payment for, any tendered Shares, and may
terminate the Offer in each case, consistent with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and not accept for payment any tendered Shares, if (i) the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived (pursuant to the Merger
Agreement) prior to the expiration of the Offer, (ii) the Merger Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with its terms or (iii) at any time on or
after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Offer,
any of the following events shall occur and be continuing and shall not have
resulted from the breach by Dendrite or the Purchaser of any of their
obligations under the Merger Agreement:

     - there shall be any Order of any nature of any court of governmental
       authority of competent jurisdiction that is in effect that restrains or
       prohibits the consummation of the Offer and Merger; provided, that each
       of Dendrite and the Purchaser shall have used its best efforts to have
       such Order vacated or denied, including complying with the covenants
       described under Section 10 ("Background of the Offer; The Merger
       Agreement -- Best Efforts"); or

     - (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
       Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct, except in each case for
       the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct
       which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
       to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) and (ii) any such
       inaccuracy has not been cured; or

     - (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any obligation
       or to comply with any agreement, covenant or condition of the Company to
       be performed by or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement, (ii)
       any such breach or failure would reasonably be expected to have a
       Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any such breach or failure has not been
       cured; or

     - except as indicated in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
       Company to Dendrite, there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect;

which in the reasonable judgment of Dendrite or the Purchaser, in any such case,
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer and/or with acceptance for
payment of or payment for Shares.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the foregoing conditions are
for the sole benefit of Dendrite and the Purchaser, and may (except for the
Minimum Condition) be waived by Dendrite or the Purchaser, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Dendrite or the
Purchaser. The failure by Dendrite or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

     As used herein:

     "Material Adverse Effect" is, when used in connection with the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, any event, change, circumstance or effect that is
materially adverse to the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, excluding any effects related to
or resulting from (i) events affecting the United States or global economy or
capital or financial markets generally, (ii) changes in conditions in the
industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries or its customers operate,
(iii) changes in laws or in the authoritative interpretations thereof or in
regulatory guidance related thereto, (iv) earthquakes or similar catastrophes,
or acts of war, sabotage, terrorism, military action or any escalation or
worsening thereof, (v) the Merger Agreement, the announcement thereof, the
transactions contemplated hereby and the identity or involvement by Dendrite,
the Purchaser or their respective affiliates, or (vi) the termination of the
Cegedim Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, or (vii) any
of those matters set forth in Section 1.1(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the Merger Agreement; it being understood that the matters set forth
in clauses (i) through (vii) are not in and of themselves a Material Adverse
Effect, and shall not result in the breach of a representation or warranty
contained in the Merger Agreement and shall not give rise to a right of Dendrite
to terminate the Merger Agreement.

15.  CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS

     General.  Based upon its examination of publicly available information with
respect to the Company, the review of certain information furnished by the
Company to Dendrite and discussions of representatives of Dendrite with
representatives of the Company during Dendrite's investigation of the Company
(see Section 10 ("Background of the Offer the Merger Agreement")), neither the
Purchaser nor Dendrite is aware of any license or other regulatory permit that
appears to be material to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by the acquisition of Shares
by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or, except as set forth below, of any
approval or other action by any domestic (federal or state) or foreign
governmental, administrative or regulatory authority or agency that would be
required prior to the acquisition of Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer. Should any such approval or other action be required, it is the
Purchaser's present intention to seek such approval or action. There can be no
assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained
without substantial conditions or that adverse consequences might not result to
the business of the Company, the Purchaser or Dendrite or that certain parts of
the businesses of the Company, the Purchaser or Dendrite might not have to be
disposed of or held separate or other substantial conditions complied with in
order to obtain such approval or other action or in the event that such approval
was not obtained or such other action was not taken. The Purchaser's obligation
under the Offer to accept for payment, and pay for, Shares is subject to certain
conditions, including conditions relating to the legal matters discussed in this
Section 15 ("Certain Legal Matters and Regulatory Approvals"). See Section 14
("Certain Conditions of the Offer").

     State Takeover Laws.  The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an "interested
stockholder" (generally a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or
more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate
thereof) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to include Mergers
and certain other transactions) with a Delaware corporation for a period of
three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder
unless, among other things, prior to such date the board of directors of the
corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction in which
the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. The Company's Board
of Directors has approved the Merger Agreement and the Purchaser's acquisition
of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. Therefore, Section 203 of the
DGCL is inapplicable to the Offer or the Merger.

     A number of other states have adopted laws and regulations applicable to
attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated, or have
substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal
places of business, or whose business operations otherwise have substantial
economic effects, in such states. In Edgar v. Mite Corp., the Supreme Court of
the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business
Takeover Statute, that, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of
corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. However, in 1987 in
CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, the Supreme Court of the United States
held that the State of Indiana may, as a matter of corporate law and, in
particular, with respect to those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate
governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquirer from voting on the
affairs of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining
stockholders, provided that such laws were applicable only under certain
conditions. Subsequently, in TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a Federal
district court in Oklahoma ruled that the Oklahoma takeover statutes were
unconstitutional insofar as they applied to corporations incorporated outside
Oklahoma in that they would subject such corporations to inconsistent
regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds, a Federal district
court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee takeover statutes were
unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee. This
decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. In December 1988, a Federal district court in Florida held in Grand
Metropolitan plc v. Butterworth that the provisions of the Florida Affiliated
Transactions Act and Florida Control Share Acquisition Act were unconstitutional
as applied to corporations incorporated outside of Florida.

     The Company, directly or through subsidiaries, conducts business in a
number of states throughout the United States, some of which may have enacted
takeover laws. The Purchaser does not know whether any of these laws will, by
their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger and has not attempted to comply
with any such laws. Should any person seek to apply any state takeover law to
the Offer or the Merger, the Purchaser reserves the right to challenge the
validity or applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings
or otherwise, and nothing contained in this Offer to Purchase nor any action
taken in connection herewith is intended as a waiver of that right. In the event
it is asserted that one or more state takeover laws applies to the Offer or the
Merger, and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or
invalid as applied to the Offer or the Merger, the Purchaser might be required
to file certain information with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state
authorities. In addition, if enjoined, the Purchaser might be unable to accept
for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or be delayed in
continuing or consummating the Offer and the Merger. In such case, the Purchaser
may not be obligated to accept for payment, or pay for, any Shares tendered. See
Section 14 ("Certain Conditions of the Offer").

16.  FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Except as set forth below, the Purchaser will not pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of
Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     Advest, Inc., is acting as Dealer Manager for the Offer. Dendrite has
agreed to pay Advest, Inc. for acting as Dealer Manager $50,000 upon
commencement of the Offer and $75,000 should the Company's stockholders validly
tender 90% or more of the outstanding Shares. Dendrite has also agreed to
reimburse Advest, Inc. for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, and to indemnify
Advest, Inc. against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with its
engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

     The Purchaser and Dendrite have retained Strategic Stock Surveillance, LLC,
as the Information Agent, and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as the
Depositary, in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, telephone, telex, telecopy, telegraph and personal
interview and may request banks, brokers, dealers and other nominee stockholders
to forward materials relating to the Offer to beneficial owners.

     The Information Agent and the Depositary will receive reasonable and
customary compensation for their services in connection with the Offer, plus
reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and will

be indemnified against certain liabilities in connection with the Offer,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

     Brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust companies will be reimbursed
by the Purchaser for customary handling and mailing expenses incurred by them in
forwarding material to their customers.

17.  MISCELLANEOUS.

     The Purchaser is not aware of any jurisdiction where the making of the
Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto is prohibited by any
administrative or judicial action or by any valid law of such jurisdiction. If
the Purchaser becomes aware of any valid law of a jurisdiction prohibiting the
making of the Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto; the Purchaser
will make a good faith effort to comply with such law. If, after such good faith
effort, the Purchaser cannot comply with such law, the Offer will not be made to
(nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in
such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other
laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer
shall be deemed to be made on behalf of the Purchaser by one or more registered
brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION
ON BEHALF OF DENDRITE, THE PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY NOT CONTAINED IN THIS OFFER
TO PURCHASE OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, AND, IF GIVEN OR MADE, SUCH
INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED.

     Pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Exchange Act, Dendrite and the Purchaser have filed with the SEC the Schedule
TO, together with exhibits, furnishing certain additional information with
respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO and any amendments thereto, including
exhibits, may be inspected at, and copies may be obtained from, the same places
and in the same manner as set forth in Section 7 ("Certain Information
Concerning the Company") (except that they will not be available at the regional
offices of the SEC).

                             AMGIS ACQUISITION CO.

Facsimiles of the Letter of Transmittal will be accepted. The Letter of
Transmittal and certificates evidencing Shares and any other required documents

                    SECTION 262 OF DGCL -- APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to sec. 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to sec. 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to sec.
251(g) of this title), sec. 252, sec. 254, sec. 257, sec. 258, sec. 263 or sec.
264 of this title:

          (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of sec. 251 of this title.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     sec.sec. 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a.  Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
        such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

             b.  Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository
        receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
        receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective
        date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national
        securities exchange or designated as a national market system security
        on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
        Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

             c.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
        receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
        paragraph; or

             d.  Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
        cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
        described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this
        paragraph.

          (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under sec. 253 of this title is not owned by the
     parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
     be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

     (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate

                                       A-1

of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

          (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

          (2)  If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to sec. 228
     or sec. 253 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
     corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of
     any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation
     and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class
     or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in
     such notice a copy of this section. Such notice may, and, if given on or
     after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
     such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
     stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date
     of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
     resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand
     will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity
     of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
     appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either
     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
     determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
     constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
     not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
     if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
     date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
     record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
     day on which the notice is given.

     (e)  Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the
                                       A-2

effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the
right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied
with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request,
shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number
of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the
stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a
statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10
days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) hereof, whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the Office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

                                       A-3

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

     (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

                                       A-4

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to Amgis Acquisition Co., a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser") and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite
International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Dendrite"), the above-described
Shares in exchange for payment of $2.83 per Share, net to the seller in cash,
without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Offer to Purchase and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with
any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively constitute the
"Offer"), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
May 9, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Dendrite, the Purchaser and the
Company.

     On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and together with, if the Offer is
extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or
amendment), subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order
of, the Purchaser, all right, title and interest in and to all of the Shares
that are being tendered hereby (and any and all dividends, distributions,
rights, other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares on or after May 16, 2003 (collectively, "Distributions")), and
irrevocably appoints American Stock Transfer & Trust Co. (the "Depositary") the
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to
such Shares (and any Distributions), with full power of substitution (such power
of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest),
to the fullest extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to such Shares
(and any Distributions) (a) to deliver certificates for such Shares (and any
such other Shares, securities or rights) or transfer ownership of such Shares
(and any Distributions) on the account books maintained by the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility together, in either such case, with all accompanying evidences
of transfer and authenticity to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser, (b) to
present such Shares (and any Distributions) for transfer on the books of the
Company and (c) to receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of
beneficial ownership of such Shares (and any Distributions), all in accordance
with the terms and the conditions of the Offer.

     The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each of the Purchaser and its
executive officers as an attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, each
with full power of substitution, to the full extent of such stockholder's rights
with respect to the Shares tendered hereby which have been accepted for payment
by the Purchaser prior to the time any such action is taken and with respect to
which the undersigned is entitled to vote and with respect to any Distributions.
The Purchaser and its executive officers will, with respect to the Shares and
any Distributions for which the appointment is effective, be empowered to
exercise all voting and any other rights of such stockholder, as they, in their
sole discretion, may deem proper at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of
the Company's stockholders, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or
otherwise. This proxy and power of attorney shall be irrevocable and coupled
with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment is effective when, and
only to the extent that, the Purchaser deposits the payment for such Shares with
the Depositary. Upon the effectiveness of such appointment, without further
action, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents given by the
undersigned with respect to such Shares and any Distributions will be revoked,
and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may be
given (and, if given, will not be deemed effective).

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby and any Distributions and, when the same are accepted for
payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good and marketable title
thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances,
and the same will not be subject to any adverse claim. The undersigned will,
upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the
Depositary or the Company to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Shares tendered hereby and any Distributions.

     All authority conferred, or agreed to be conferred, pursuant to this Letter
of Transmittal shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or
incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned hereunder
shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal
representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, successors and assigns of the
undersigned.

     The undersigned understands that the valid tender of Shares pursuant to any
one of the procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and in the Instructions
hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and the
Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. The
undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer
to Purchase, the Purchaser may not be required to accept for payment any of the
Shares tendered hereby.

certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment in the name(s) of
the registered holder(s) indicated in the above box labeled "Description of

             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1.  GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES.  Signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must
be guaranteed by a firm (including most commercial banks, savings and loan
associations and brokerage houses) that is a member of the Securities Transfer
Agents Medallion Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as
such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(each of the foregoing being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"), except
in cases where Shares are tendered (i) by the registered holder(s) (which term,
for purposes of this document, includes any participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility's system whose name appears on a security position listing as
the holder(s) of the Shares) of Shares tendered herewith and such registered
owner has NOT completed the box labeled "Special Payment Instructions" or the
box labeled "Special Delivery Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or
(ii) for the account of an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5.

     2.  DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND SHARE CERTIFICATES OR BOOK-ENTRY
CONFIRMATIONS.  This Letter of Transmittal is to be used either if certificates
are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an Agent's Message is utilized, if
delivery of Shares are to be made pursuant to the procedures for tender by
book-entry transfer set forth in the Offer to Purchase to an account maintained
by the Depositary at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility.

     In order for Shares to be validly tendered pursuant to the Offer, a holder
of Shares must, prior to the Expiration Date (a) deliver to the Depositary at
its address set forth on the back cover of the Letter of Transmittal a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), with
any required signature guarantees, the Share Certificates to be tendered and any
other documents required to be included with this Letter of Transmittal under
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof and the Offer to Purchase, (b)
cause such holder's broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or custodian
to tender applicable Shares pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer
described below or (c) comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described
below and in the Offer to Purchase.

     Stockholders whose certificates are not immediately available or who cannot
deliver all other required documents to the Depositary on or prior to the
Expiration Date or who cannot comply with the procedures for book-entry transfer
on a timely basis may nevertheless tender their Shares by properly completing
and duly executing a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (or a facsimile thereof)
pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth below and in the Offer
to Purchase.

     Pursuant to such guaranteed delivery procedures, (i) such tender must be
made by or through an Eligible Institution, (ii) a properly completed and duly
executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (or a manually signed facsimile thereof),
substantially in the form provided by Purchaser, must be received by the
Depositary prior to the Expiration Date and (iii) the Share Certificates, in
proper form for transfer (or a confirmation of the book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility of Shares tendered by
book-entry transfer), as well as this Letter of Transmittal properly completed
and duly executed (or a facsimile thereof) with any required signature
guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, a Book-Entry Confirmation
along with an Agent's Message), and any other documents required by this Letter
of Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary within three trading days
after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. A "trading
day" is any day on which The Nasdaq National Market is open for business.

     If Share Certificates are forwarded at different times to the Depositary, a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal must accompany each
such delivery.

THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS,
INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION
AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER. DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN
ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL
IS RECOMMENDED WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN ALL CASES,
SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted. All
tendering stockholders, by executing this Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
signed facsimile thereof), waive any right to receive any notice of the
acceptance of their Shares for payment.

     3.  INADEQUATE SPACE.  If the space provided under "Description of Shares
Tendered" is inadequate, the certificate numbers and/or the number of Shares
should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

     4.  PARTIAL TENDERS (APPLICABLE TO CERTIFICATE STOCKHOLDERS ONLY).  If
fewer than all the Shares evidenced by any certificate delivered to the
Depositary are to be tendered, fill in the number of Shares that are to be
tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares Tendered." In such cases, new
certificate(s) for the remainder of the Shares not tendered that were evidenced
by the old certificate(s) will be sent to the registered holder(s), unless
otherwise provided in the "Special Payment Instructions" and/or "Special
Delivery Instructions" boxes above on this Letter of Transmittal, as soon as
practicable after the acceptance of payment of, and payment for, the Shares
tendered herewith. All Shares represented by certificates delivered to the
Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5.  SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered owner(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificate(s) without any change whatsoever.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are owned of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several
certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate
Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or stock powers are
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to the Purchaser of the authority of such person to so act must be
submitted.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered owner(s) of the
Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of certificates or
separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be made to, or
certificates for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be
issued in the name of, a person other than the registered owner(s). Signatures
on such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered owner of the certificates(s) listed in the above box labeled,
"Description of Shares Tendered," the certificate(s) must be endorsed or
accompanied by the appropriate stock power(s), in either case signed exactly as
the name(s) of the registered owner(s) appear on the certificate(s).
Signature(s) on such certificate(s) or stock power(s) must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. See Instruction 1.

     6.  STOCK TRANSFER TAXES.  Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction
6, the Purchaser will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer
and sale of Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however,
payment of the purchase price of any Shares is to be made to, or (in the
circumstances permitted hereby) if certificates for Shares not tendered or not
accepted for payment are to be registered in the name of, any person other than
the registered owner(s), or if tendered certificates are registered in the name
of any person other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, the
amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered owner(s)
or such other person) payable on account of the transfer to such other person
will be deducted from the purchase price of such Shares purchased unless
evidence satisfactory to Purchaser of the payment of such taxes, or exemption
therefrom, is submitted.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS INSTRUCTION 6, IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR TRANSFER
TAX STAMPS TO BE AFFIXED TO THE CERTIFICATE(S) EVIDENCING THE SHARES TENDERED
HEREBY.

     7.  SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS.  If a check for the purchase
price of any Shares accepted for payment is to be issued in the name of, and/or
certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment are to be issued or
returned to, a person other than the signer(s) of this Letter of Transmittal or
if a check and/or such certificates are to be sent to a person other than the
signer(s) of this Letter of Transmittal or to an address other than that shown
above, the "Special Payment Instructions" and/or "Special Delivery Instructions"
boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed. Any stockholder(s)
delivering Shares by book-entry transfer may request that Shares not purchased
be credited to such account maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as
such stockholder(s) may designate in the above box labeled "Special Payment
Instructions." If no such instructions are given, any such Shares not purchased
will

be returned by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above as the account from which such Shares were delivered.

     8.  REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES.  Questions or requests
for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent or the Dealer Manager at
their respective telephone numbers and addresses set forth below or from your
broker, dealer, commercial bank or trust company. Additional copies of the Offer
to Purchase, this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and
other tender offer materials may be obtained from the Information Agent.

     9.  SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9.  Each tendering stockholder is required to provide
the Depositary with a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), generally
the stockholder's U.S. social security or U.S. federal employer identification
number, on Substitute Form W-9 below. Failure to provide the information on the
form may subject the tendering stockholder to 30% U.S. federal income tax backup
withholding on the payment of the purchase price. The box in Part 3 of the form
may be checked if the tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has
applied for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future.

     10.  WAIVER OF CONDITIONS.  The conditions of the Offer may be waived by
Purchaser (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement), in
whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, in Purchaser's sole
discretion.

     11.  LOST, DESTROYED OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES.  If any certificate(s)
representing Shares has been lost, destroyed or stolen the holder should
promptly notify the Company's transfer agent for the Shares, Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A., at (888) 282-1169 and check the box under "Description of Shares
Tendered" indicating that Shares have been lost, destroyed or stolen. The holder
will then be instructed as to the procedure to be followed in order to replace
the certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be
processed until the procedures for replacing lost, destroyed or stolen
certificates have been completed.

     12.  TENDERING RIGHTS.  On August 29, 2000, the Company adopted a rights
agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A. Rights, as described below, are transferable only with the Shares
until they become exercisable upon the Distribution Date (as defined herein).

     Under the Rights Agreement, the "Distribution Date" is the earlier of (i)
the tenth day after the date on which a person shall be the beneficial owner of
15% or more of the Shares then outstanding (an "Acquiring Person") or (ii) the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the
Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person)
after the date of the commencement by any person (other than an exempt person)
of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of such person (other
than an exempt person) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation
of which would result in any person (other than an exempt person) becoming the
beneficial owner of Shares aggregating 15% or more of the Shares then
outstanding.

     The Company and Equiserve Trust Company amended the Rights Agreement on May
9, 2003 to provide that (x) notwithstanding anything in the Rights Agreement to
the contrary, none of Dendrite, the Purchaser nor any of their respective
affiliates shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person for the purposes of the
Rights Agreement, and (y) notwithstanding anything in the Rights Agreement to
the contrary, a Distribution Date shall not be deemed to have occurred as a
result of the approval, execution, delivery or performance of the Merger
Agreement or the announcement, commencement or consummation of the Offer or the
consummation of the merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

     Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by the Share
Certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof, and until a
Distribution Date, the tender of a Share will constitute a tender of the
associated Right. Upon a Distribution Date separate certificates evidencing the
Rights (the "Rights Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of Shares
as of the close of business on the Distribution Date (and to each initial record
holder of certain Shares originally issued after the Distribution Date), and
such separate Rights Certificates alone will thereafter evidence the Rights.

IMPORTANT:  THIS DULY COMPLETED AND SIGNED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR A MANUALLY
SIGNED FACSIMILE THEREOF (TOGETHER WITH ANY SIGNATURE GUARANTEES, THE
CERTIFICATES FOR TENDERED SHARES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL
OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS) OR THE NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED
BY THE DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under U.S. federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are
accepted for purchase is required by law to provide the Depositary (as payer)
with such stockholder's correct TIN on Substitute Form W-9 below and to certify
that such TIN is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN) or
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding. If such
stockholder is an individual, the TIN is generally his or her U.S. social
security number. If a stockholder fails to provide a TIN to the Depositary, such
stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to
Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding at
30% (see below).

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals and entities) will not be subject to the backup withholding
and reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, that stockholder must generally submit a Form W-8, signed
under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. A Form
W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for
additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 30%
of any payments made to the stockholder or payee pursuant to the Offer. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the Internal Revenue Service provided certain conditions are met.

                         PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments made to a stockholder whose
tendered Shares are accepted for purchase, the stockholder is required to notify
the Depositary of its correct TIN by completing Substitute Form W-9 certifying
(1) that the TIN provided on such Form is correct (or that such stockholder is
awaiting a TIN, in which case the stockholder should check the box in Part 3 of
the Substitute Form W-9), (2) that such stockholder is a U.S. person and (3)
that (A) such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, (B) such
stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such
stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report
all interest or dividends or (C) the Internal Revenue Service has notified the
stockholder that the stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. The
stockholder must sign and date the Substitute Form W-9 where indicated,
certifying, under penalties of perjury, that the information on such Form is
correct.

     A nonexempt stockholder may check the box in Part 3 of the attached
Substitute Form W-9 if such stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has
applied for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If a
nonexempt stockholder checks the box in Part 3, such stockholder must also sign
the attached Certification of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number in order
to prevent backup withholding. Notwithstanding that a stockholder complies with
the foregoing, the Depositary will backup withhold at 30% on payments made to
such stockholder pursuant to the Offer prior to the time a properly certified
TIN is provided to the Depositary.

     Alternatively, a stockholder that qualifies as an exempt recipient (other
than a shareholder required to complete Form W-8 as described above) should
write "Exempt" in Part 1 of the Substitute Form W-9, enter his correct TIN and
sign and date such Form where indicated.

  PRIVACY ACT NOTICE. -- Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers who
must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the numbers for identification
purposes and to help verify the accuracy of tax returns. Payers must be given
the numbers whether or not recipients are required to file tax returns. Payers

interest, dividend, and certain other payments made prior to January 1, 2004 to
a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer identification number to a payer.
Certain penalties may also apply.

PENALTIES
(1) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER -- If you fail
to furnish your correct taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
(2) CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO WITHHOLDING -- If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.
(3) CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING INFORMATION -- Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.
(4) MISUSE OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS -- If the payer discloses or uses
taxpayer identification numbers in violation of Federal law, the payer may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties.

To Brokers, Dealers, Commercial Banks, Trust Companies and Other Nominees:

described in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 16, 2003 (the "Offer to
Purchase"), and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the
Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer", copies of which are enclosed herewith). Please furnish
copies of the enclosed materials to those of your clients for whose accounts you

          1.  The Offer to Purchase, dated May 16, 2003;

     Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9; and

          6.  Return envelope addressed to American Stock Transfer & Trust Co.
     (the "Depositary").

WE URGE YOU TO CONTACT YOUR CLIENTS AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE NOTE THAT
THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 11:59 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME,
ON FRIDAY, JUNE 13, 2003, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 9, 2003, (the "Merger Agreement"), among Dendrite, Purchaser and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, after the
purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of
the other conditions described in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). The Company's
Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders and recommends that the Company's stockholders tender their
Shares in the Offer.

THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THERE HAVING BEEN VALIDLY
TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER, THE NUMBER OF
SHARES WHICH CONSTITUTES AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A
DILUTED BASIS ON THE DATE OF ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT ("ON A DILUTED BASIS" MEANS
THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES WHICH THE COMPANY MAY
BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE PURSUANT TO WARRANTS, OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR
OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT THAT DATE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXERCISE PRICES OR
STRIKE PRICES IN RESPECT OF SUCH WARRANTS, OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR
OBLIGATIONS ARE LESS THAN THE OFFER PRICE). THE OFFER IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
OTHER CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE. THE OFFER IS NOT CONTINGENT
ON ANY FINANCING CONDITION.

     In order to validly tender Shares, a stockholder must tender the associated
preferred stock purchase rights that were granted under the Rights Agreement,
dated August 29, 2000 between the Company and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A., as
amended by Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated May 9, 2003 (the "Rights Agreement").

     Until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), (see
Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares")), the Rights will be evidenced by
the certificates for Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof, and
until a Distribution Date the tender of a Share will constitute a tender of the
associated right. Upon a Distribution Date separate certificates widening the
Rights (the "Rights Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of Shares
as of the close of business on the Distribution Date (and to each initial record
holder of certain Shares originally issued after the Distribution Date), and
such separate Rights Certificates alone will thereafter evidence the Rights.

     In all cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period (as defined
in Section 2 ("Procedures for Tendering Shares")), Purchaser will pay for Shares
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer only after timely
receipt by the Depositary of:

          (a) the certificates representing the Shares (the "Share
     Certificates"), or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such
     Shares into the Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company
     pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2 ("Acceptance for Payment
     and Payment for Shares Procedures for Tendering Shares") of the Offer to
     Purchase;

          (b) the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly
     completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or, in
     the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as defined in
     Section 3 ("the Offer to Purchase")); and

          (c) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

     If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and such
stockholder's Share Certificates evidencing such Shares are not immediately
available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share Certificates and all
other required documents to the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, or the
procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer cannot be

completed on a timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered, by
following the procedures for guaranteed delivery set forth in Section 2
("Procedures for Tendering Shares") of the Offer to Purchase.

     The Dealer Manager is not making any recommendation to the stockholders as
to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their Shares. Stockholders must
make their own decision as to whether to tender their Shares. Stockholders
should discuss whether to tender their Shares with their brokers or other
financial and tax advisers.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID BY THE PURCHASER ON THE PURCHASE
PRICE OF THE SHARES REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR ANY DELAY IN
MAKING SUCH PAYMENT PURSUANT TO THE OFFER.

     Neither Dendrite nor Purchaser will pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, dealer or other person (other than the Depositary, the Information Agent
and the Dealer Manager, as disclosed in Section 16 ("Fees and Expenses") of the
Offer to Purchase) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. You
will be reimbursed upon request for customary mailing and handling expenses
incurred by you in forwarding the enclosed offering materials to your clients.
Purchaser will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer and
sale of Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer, except as otherwise
provided in Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

To Our Clients:

     Enclosed for your consideration are an Offer to Purchase dated May 16, 2003
(the "Offer to Purchase") and a related Letter of Transmittal (which, together
with the Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer") relating to the Offer by Amgis Acquisition
Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Dendrite International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Dendrite"), to purchase
all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), of SYNAVANT Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights", and together with the
Common Stock, the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $2.83 per Share, net to the
seller in cash (the "Offer Price"), without interest, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

     We (or our nominees) are the holder of record of Shares held by us for your
account. A tender of those Shares can be made only by us as the holder of record
and pursuant to your instructions. The Letter of Transmittal is furnished to you
for your information only and cannot be used to tender Shares held by us for
your account.

     Accordingly, we request instructions as to whether you wish to have us
tender on your behalf any or all of the Shares held by us for your account
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to
Purchase.

     Please note the following:

          1.  The Offer Price is $2.83 per Share, net to the seller in cash,
     without interest thereon, as set forth in the Introduction to the Offer to
     Purchase.

          2.  The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
     Merger, dated as of May 9, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement") among Dendrite,
     the Purchaser and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other
     things, that, after the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and
     the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions described in the Merger
     Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General
     Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Purchaser will be merged with
     and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the
     Company, which will continue as the surviving corporation, will become a
     wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite.

     been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the

     ("on a diluted basis" means the number of Shares outstanding, together with
     the Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants,
     options, restricted stock units or obligations outstanding at that date to
     the extent that the exercise prices or strike prices in respect of such
     warrants, options, restricted stock units or obligations are less than the
     Offer Price). The Offer is also subject to certain other conditions
     contained in the Offer to Purchase. See Section 1 ("Terms of the Offer")
     and Section 14 ("Certain Conditions of the Offer") of the Offer to

     the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the
     best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has recommended that
     the Company's stockholders tender their Shares in the Offer.

account, please so instruct us by completing, executing and returning to us the
instruction form set forth below. An envelope to return your instructions to us
is enclosed. If you authorize the tender of your Shares, all such Shares will be

     This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an
offer to sell Shares (as defined below). The Offer (as defined below) is being
made solely by the Offer to Purchase, dated May 16, 2003 and the related Letter
of Transmittal, and any amendments or supplements thereto, and is being made to
holders of Shares. Purchaser (as defined below) is not aware of any jurisdiction
where the making of the Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto is
prohibited by any administrative or judicial action or by any valid law of such
jurisdiction. If Purchaser becomes aware of any valid law of a jurisdiction
prohibiting the making of the Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant
thereto, Purchaser will make a good faith effort to comply with such law. If,
after such good faith effort, Purchaser cannot comply with such law, the Offer
will not be made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the
holders of Shares in such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction where the
securities, blue sky or other laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed
broker or dealer, the Offer shall be deemed to be made on behalf of Purchaser by
one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such
jurisdiction.

                          A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

                          DENDRITE INTERNATIONAL, INC.

     Amgis Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dendrite International, Inc., a corporation organized
under the laws of State of New Jersey ("Dendrite"), is offering to purchase any
and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the "Common Stock"), of SYNAVANT Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
including the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights" and,
together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $2.83 per
Share, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer Price"), without interest, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and in
the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to Purchase
and any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer").
Following the Offer, Purchaser intends to effect the Merger described below.

 THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 11:59 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME,
            ON FRIDAY, JUNE 13, 2003, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there having been
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
number of Shares which constitutes at least a majority of the Shares outstanding
on a diluted basis on the date of acceptance for payment ("on a diluted basis"
means the number of Shares outstanding, together with the Shares which the
Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants, options, restricted stock
units or obligations outstanding at that date to the extent that the exercise
prices or strike prices in respect of such warrants, options, restricted stock
units or obligations are less than the Offer Price). The Offer is also subject
to certain other conditions contained in the Offer to Purchase. See "Section 1.
Terms of the Offer" and "Section 14. Certain Conditions of the Offer" of the
Offer to Purchase, which describes in full the conditions to the Offer. The
Offer is not contingent on any financing condition.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 9, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Dendrite, Purchaser and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, after the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions described in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As
a result of the Merger, the Company, which will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Dendrite. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned by the Company, Dendrite or Purchaser, and any Shares held by
stockholders who shall have demanded and perfected appraisal rights under
Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in
cash, without interest.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF
THE COMPANY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS, AND HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY'S
STOCKHOLDERS TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE OFFER.

     For purposes of the Offer (including during any Subsequent Offering Period
(as defined below)), Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment (and
thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and
when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to American Stock American Stock
Transfer & Trust Co. (the "Depositary") of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of
such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer, payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will be made by
deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as
agent for tendering stockholders whose Shares have been accepted for payment for
the purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments
to validly tendering stockholders. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL PURCHASER PAY
INTEREST ON THE OFFER PRICE, REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT. In
all cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period), Purchaser will pay
for Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer only after
timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such Shares
and, if applicable, certificates evidencing Rights (together, the "Share
Certificates") or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares
into the Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry
Transfer Facility") pursuant to the procedures described in the Offer to
Purchase, (ii) the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly
completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or, in the
case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase) and (iii) any other documents required under the Letter of
Transmittal.

     The term "Expiration Date" means 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on Friday,
June 13, 2003, unless the Purchaser shall have extended the expiration of the
Offer, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and
date at which the Offer, as so extended by Purchaser, will expire. The Merger
Agreement provides that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not extend the Expiration Date beyond the initial Expiration
Date, except (i) as required by applicable law, (ii) that if, immediately prior
to the Expiration Date (as it may be extended), the Shares tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute less than 90% of the outstanding
Shares, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, on one occasion, extend the Offer
for a period not to exceed ten business days, or (iii) that if any condition to
the Offer has not been satisfied or waived, Purchaser may in its sole
discretion, extend the Expiration Date for one or more periods but no later than
August 1, 2003, without the Company's prior written consent. Any extension of
the period during which the Offer is open will be followed promptly by public
announcement thereof, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next
business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. During any such
extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject
to the Offer and subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to withdraw
such stockholder's Shares.

     The Purchaser may provide for a subsequent offering period in connection
with the Offer if, at the expiration of the Offer, all of the conditions of the
Offer have been satisfied or waived but the number of Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer constitutes less than 90% of outstanding Shares.
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the Purchaser will
extend its offer to purchase Shares beyond the Expiration Date for a subsequent
offering period not to exceed 20 business days (the "Subsequent Offering
Period"), if, among other things, at the Expiration Date, (i) all of the
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived but the number of Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer constitutes less than 90% of the
outstanding Shares and (ii) the Purchaser accepts for payment, and promptly pays
for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date
of the Offer. SHARES TENDERED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD MAY NOT BE
WITHDRAWN. Purchaser will immediately accept for payment, and promptly pay for,
all validly tendered Shares as they are received during the Subsequent Offering
Period. If the Purchaser provides for a Subsequent Offering Period, it will be
effected by Purchaser

giving oral or written notice of the Subsequent Offering Period to the
Depositary and making a public announcement to that effect on the next business
day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, may
also be withdrawn at any time after July 15, 2003. For a withdrawal of Shares to
be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be
timely received by the Depositary at its address set forth on the back cover of
the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name of
the person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be
withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if different
from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates
evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise identified to
the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such Share Certificates,
the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates must be submitted to the
Depositary and the signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed
by an Eligible Institution (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), unless such
Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares
have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as
described in the Offer to Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify
the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be
credited with the withdrawn Shares. All questions as to the form and validity
(including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal will be determined by
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and
binding.

     The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's stockholder list and
security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to the
holders of Shares. Purchaser will mail the Offer to Purchase and the related
Letter of Transmittal to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the
Company's stockholder list and will furnish the Offer to Purchase and the
related Letter of Transmittal, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners
of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar
persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder
list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's
security position listing.

be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or individual.

     The parties acknowledge that all Evaluation Material is the exclusive
property of the disclosing party, and the receiving party shall have no
proprietary interest therein. Each party will use the other party's Evaluation
Material solely for the purpose of evaluating the possible business relationship
or transaction and shall not use any Evaluation Material in any way directly or
indirectly detrimental to the disclosing party. Unless and until the parties
have consummated a relationship pursuant to a definitive written agreement (a
"Definitive Agreement"), all Evaluation Material of the disclosing party will be
kept confidential by the receiving party and its Representatives. A receiving
party may disclose the Evaluation Material of the other or portions thereof only
to those of its Representatives who need to know such information for the
purpose of evaluating a possible business relationship or transaction and who
agree to keep such information confidential.

     Each party will inform each of its Representatives of the confidential
nature of the Evaluation Material and of the provisions of this agreement, and
will cause each such Representative to agree to comply fully with the
restrictions on use of the Evaluation Material contained in this agreement and
not to disclose the information to any other individual. Each party will be
responsible for any breach of this agreement or other improper use of Evaluation
Material by any of its

Representatives or by any other person to whom information is provided by such
party or its Representatives, in contravention of this agreement or otherwise.

     Without the prior written consent of the other party, each of the parties
agrees that it will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to
any person either the fact that any investigations, discussions or negotiations
are taking place concerning a possible business relationship or transaction, or
that either party has requested or requested Evaluation Material from the other,
or any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect to any such
business relationship or transaction, including, but not limited to, the status
thereof and the terms or provisions of any proposal or offer made by either
party, whether written or oral; provided that either party may make such
disclosures required by applicable securities laws as are necessary to comply
therewith or with the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange,
provided that the nondisclosing party shall be given reasonable prior notice
thereof and an opportunity to comment on or object thereto.

     2.  Compelled Disclosures.  In the event that a party or any of its
Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request
for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any of the other party's Evaluation Material, such party shall provide
the other party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that it
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and will cooperate fully
with its efforts in obtain any such order or other relief. In the event that
such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the party being compelled
will provide only that portion of the Evaluation Material which it is advised by
written opinion of counsel is legally required, and such disclosure will not
result in any liability hereunder unless such disclosure was caused by or
resulted from a previous disclosure by such party or its Representatives that
was not permitted by this agreement. Additionally, such party agrees to exercise
its best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material. The party
being compelled to make disclosure shall be reimbursed for all reasonable
expenses incurred by it or its Representatives in complying with this paragraph
2, except to the extent such amounts are recoverable from the party compelling
disclosure. Such party agrees to exercise its best efforts to recover all
expenses which are recoverable from the party compelling disclosure.

     3.  Treatment of Information.  If at any time either party so requests, the
other party promptly will return to the requesting party all copies of such
party's Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of its
Representatives, and will destroy all copies of any analyses, compilations,
studies or other documents prepared by it or for its use containing or
reflecting any such Evaluation Material (including, but not limited to, those
identified in subparagraphs 1(ii) and (iii) above), and will furnish the
requesting party with prompt written confirmation of such destruction.
Notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Evaluation Material, the
parties will continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations
under agreement.

     4.  Due Diligence.  It is agreed that all (a) communications regarding a
possible business relationship or transaction, (b) requests for additional
information, (c) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (d)
discussions or questions regarding procedures, must be submitted or directed to
the President or Chief Executive Officer of such party unless otherwise directed
in writing by a party.

     5.  No Warranty of Accuracy.  The parties understand and acknowledge that
neither party is hereby making any representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material provided
by such party, and neither party nor any of its officers, directors or agents
will have any liability to the other or any person resulting from use of the
Evaluation Material by the other party or its Representatives. Only those
representations or warranties that are made in a Definitive Agreement when, as,
and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may
be specified in such Definitive Agreement, will have any legal effect.

     6.  No Obligation With Respect to Negotiations.  The parties understand and
agree that no contract or agreement providing for any business relationship or
transaction shall be deemed to exist unless and until a Definitive Agreement has
been executed and delivered, and each party hereby waives, in advance, any
claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with
any such business relationship or transaction unless and until the parties shall
have entered into a Definitive Agreement.

     Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and
all proposals made by the other or any of its Representatives with respect to a
business relationship or transaction or otherwise and to terminate negotiations
and discussions with respect hereto at any time, and that each party's
obligations under this agreement will survive any such

rejection or termination. Each party also agrees that unless and until a
Definitive Agreement with respect to any business relationship or transaction
has been executed and delivered, neither party will have any legal obligation of
any kind whatsoever with respect to any such business relationship or
transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression
with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this agreement, for the
matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
"Definitive Agreement" does not include an executed letter of intent or any
other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any written or verbal
agreement in principle or acceptance of an offer or bid, except in the extent
therein otherwise provided.

     7.  Standstill.  Until the expiration of one (1) year from the date hereof,
neither party, its affiliates (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of
1933, hereinafter "Affiliates") or those Representatives to whom the Evaluation
Material has been disclosed or who have been made aware of the discussions
between the parties concerning a possible business relationship or transaction,
shall, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the other
party, (a) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire, or make any proposal to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any voting securities of the other party, or
any rights or options to acquire such ownership; (b) propose to enter into,
directly or indirectly, any merger or business combination involving the other
party; (c) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any
solicitation of "proxies" (as such term is used in Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) to vote or seek to advise or
influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the
other party; (d) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the
meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to
any voting securities of the other party; (e) otherwise act, alone or in concert
with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board at Directors
or policies of the other party; or (f) publicly disclose any intention, plan or
arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing (collectively, the "Prohibited
Actions"), provided that, if any third party shall take or propose to take any
Prohibited Action with respect to a party hereto, the provisions of this
paragraph 7 shall thereafter no longer be applied to the other party, its
Affiliates or Representatives and each other party (and its Affiliates and
Representatives) shall thereafter be free to take any Prohibited Action.

     8.  Securities Laws.  The parties hereby acknowledge that they are aware,
and that they will advise their Representatives who are informed as to the
matters that are the subject of this agreement, that the United States
securities laws prohibit any person who has received material, nonpublic
information concerning an issuer from purchasing or selling securities of the
Issuer to whom such matters relate or from communicating such information to any
other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably forseeable that such
person is likely to purchase or sell such securities or otherwise to violate
such securities laws.

     9.  Nonsolicitation of Employees.  Both parties agree that neither will
directly or indirectly, on its own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit, divert or hire for work in any competing business or attempt to
solicit, divert or hire for work in any competing business any person or persons
employed by the other, whether or not such employment is pursuant to a written
contract with the other party or is for a determined period or at will, until
such employee has ceased his employment with the other party for at least six
(6) months provided however, a party shall not be prohibited from employing any
such person with whom the party has had communications regarding employment as
of the date first mentioned above.

     10.  Miscellaneous.  The parties agree that this agreement shall be for the
benefit of the parties hereto. The parties also agree that money damages would
not be a sufficient remedy for any violation of the terms of this agreement,
and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance in the event of any breach
of the provisions of the agreement, in addition to all other remedies available
at law or in equity.

     It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor
will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.

     This agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This agreement is for the
benefit of the parties and their directors, officers, stockholders, owners,
affiliates, and agents. This agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without reference to conflicts
of laws principles. The term of this agreement shall be a period of two (2)
years from the date of this agreement or such longer period as any of the
Evaluation Material may be protected by the Georgia Trade Secrets Act or similar
applicable state or federal law. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties respecting the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral. Every provision of this

agreement is intended to be severable. If any term or provision hereof is
illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity
shall not affect the remainder of this agreement. This agreement may not be
modified or amended except in writing by a duly authorized representative of
each party.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto affixed their hands and seals
as of the date first above written.

                             [SYNAVANT LETTERHEAD]

                                                                     May 8, 2003

IMS Health Incorporated
200 Nyala Farms
Westport, CT 06880

Dendrite International, Inc.
200 Sommerset Corporate Blvd.
Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     SYNAVANT Inc., (the "COMPANY"), intends to be acquired by Dendrite
International, Inc. ("Dendrite") and/or certain of its affiliates (the
"TRANSACTION"). The Company seeks to facilitate Dendrite's relationship with IMS
Health Incorporated ("IMS") to ensure completion of the Transaction. This letter
is executed and delivered in connection therewith.

     This is to confirm the agreement among the Company, IMS and Dendrite:

          1.  Acknowledgement.  IMS hereby acknowledges that it does not object
     to the Transaction.

          2.  Amendment to Distribution Agreement.  The parties hereby agree to
     amend the Distribution Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2000 (as it may be
     amended, modified or supplemented, the. "DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT"), between
     IMS and the Company by deleting Section 2.16 (Joint Business Opportunities;
     Non-Competition; Protection of Information) thereof in its entirety. Such
     amendment will be effective upon completion of the Transaction.

          3.  Mutual Release.  Each of the company and IMS, for itself, its
     affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
     successors and assigns, hereby releases and discharges the other from any
     and all claims, demands, causes of action, actions, judgments, liens,
     indebtedness, costs, damages, obligations, attorneys' fees, losses and
     liability of whatever kind and character, whether known or unknown,
     foreseen or unforeseen, arising under or related to, the actions taken by
     either party in furtherance of the transactions contemplated above;
     provided that nothing contained herein shall release the Company or IMS
     from any of their respective obligations under this or any other agreement
     between them or the Distribution Agreement (as amended hereby).

          4.  Option to Extend Access to Pharbase.  (a) The Company and Dendrite
     hereby grant to IMS the option, which may be exercised at any time for a
     period of six months following the date of the consummation of the
     transaction, to extend until August 31, 2005, the term of the Cross License
     Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2000, between IMS and the Company (the
     "PHARBASE CROSS LICENSE") on the same terms and conditions as currently
     provided therefor. IMS hereby consents to the assignment of the Company's
     rights and obligations under the Pharbase Cross License to Dendrite or any
     of its affiliates upon consummation of the Transaction.

          (b) Following consummation of the Transaction, the Company and
     Dendrite shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure quality
     standards and provide updates for Pharbase during the remaining term of the
     Pharbase Cross License (as may be extended pursuant to clause 4(a) hereof).

          (c) IMS shall have the right to terminate the extended Pharbase Cross
     License at six month intervals beginning on August 31, 2003 on two months
     advance written notice to the Company and Dendrite.

          5.  Consent to Assignment of Xponent Data License.  Upon consummation
     of the Transaction, the Company, Dendrite and IMS shall enter into an
     extension (the "Xponent Extension") until August 31, 2005 of the Restated
     Xponent Data License Agreement between IMS and the Company dated as of
     April 26, 2001, as amended September 1, 2002 (collectively the "Xponent
     License"), provided however that the fee payable under the Xponent
     Extension shall be equal to the fee payable under the Pharbase Cross
     License. Dendrite and the Company shall have the right to terminate the
     Xponent Extension in the event that IMS terminates the extended Pharbase
     Cross License pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof.

          6.  Payment of Certain Liabilities.  At the closing of the
     Transaction, the Company and Dendrite hereby agree to pay to IMS an amount
     equal to (a) $2,000,000 plus (b) the present value as of such time of
     $7,000,000 (discounted from January 1, 2005 at an assumed discount rate of
     6.5%) in full satisfaction of all liabilities under Section 2.1(j) (Certain
     Contingencies) of the Distribution Agreement. Dendrite shall pay and remit
     such amounts directly to IMS at the closing of the back-end merger.

     Except as amended and modified by this letter agreement, the provisions of
the Distribution Agreement, the Pharbase Cross License and the Xponent License
and all other agreements between the Company and IMS shall remain in full force
and effect.

                                         Very truly yours,

                                         SYNAVANT INC.
