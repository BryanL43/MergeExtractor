                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     Novell, Inc. ("Novell"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Delaware
Planet Inc. ("Purchaser"), is offering to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"),
of SilverStream Software, Inc. (the "Company") for $9.00 per Share, net to the
seller in cash, without interest, in connection with the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of June 9, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement") among Novell,
Purchaser and the Company. The following are some of the questions you, as a
stockholder of the Company, may have and answers to those questions. You should
carefully read this Offer to Purchase and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal
in their entirety because the information in this summary term sheet is not
complete, and additional important information is contained in the remainder of
this Offer to Purchase and in the Letter of Transmittal.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SHARES? WHY?

     Our name is Novell, Inc. We are a Delaware corporation and are making the
Offer through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Delaware Planet Inc., a Delaware
corporation, which was formed for the purpose of making a tender offer for the
Shares. The tender offer is the first step in our plan to acquire all of the
outstanding Shares.

WHAT ARE THE CLASSES AND AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES SOUGHT IN THE OFFER?

     We are seeking to purchase all of the issued and outstanding Shares. See
the "Introduction" to this Offer to Purchase and "The Offer -- Terms of the
Offer; Expiration Date."

HOW MUCH IS NOVELL OFFERING TO PAY FOR MY SHARES, AND WHAT IS THE FORM OF
PAYMENT? WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     We are offering to pay $9.00 per Share, net to you, in cash, without
interest. If you tender your Shares to us in the Offer, you will not have to pay
brokerage fees, commissions or similar expenses. If you own your Shares through
a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your Shares on your behalf,
your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult
your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply.

WHAT DOES THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     We are making the Offer pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which has been
approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors
at a meeting duly called and held has:

     - unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and
       in the best interests of the Company's stockholders;

     - unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and Novell's
       acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Stockholder's Agreements, in
       accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL");

     - unanimously resolved to recommend to the Company's stockholders that they
       accept the Offer, tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt the
       Merger Agreement; and

     - taken all action necessary to render the limitations on business
       combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the
       Merger Agreement, the Stockholder's Agreements and the transactions
       contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Stockholder's Agreements.

See the "Introduction" to this Offer to Purchase.

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE OFFER?

     Yes. All members of the Company's Board of Directors and some of their
respective affiliates and certain executive officers of the Company have agreed
to tender Shares owned by them pursuant to the Offer. Each entered into a
Stockholder's Agreement with Novell pursuant to which they agreed to tender and
sell certain Shares owned by them to us in accordance with the terms of the
Offer. The Stockholder's Agreements entered into by Novell with these
individuals relate to an aggregate of 4,611,413 shares, or approximately 20% of
the Company's Shares outstanding as of June 9, 2002 (or approximately 16% of the
Company's Shares on a fully-diluted basis). See "The Offer -- The Merger
Agreement; Other Arrangements."

DOES NOVELL HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     Yes. We will need approximately $220 million to purchase all Shares
pursuant to the Offer and to pay related fees and expenses. Since we currently
have sufficient cash and working capital available to buy all of the Shares
outstanding and pay related fees and expenses, the Offer is not subject to any
financing condition.

IS NOVELL'S FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     Since we have sufficient cash and working capital to purchase the Shares
and pay all fees relating to the Offer, the Offer is not subject to any
financing condition. Therefore, we believe our financial condition is not
material to your decision whether to tender in the Offer.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     The most significant conditions to the Offer are the following:

     - there being validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer,
       prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of
       Shares that, together with the Shares then owned by Novell and/or
       Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Novell, represents at least a
       majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the "Minimum
       Condition"); and

     - the expiration or termination of any and all waiting periods under
       applicable antitrust laws.

     We can waive some of the conditions to the Offer without the Company's
consent in our reasonable discretion; however, we cannot waive the Minimum
Condition without the Company's consent. For a complete list of the conditions
to the Offer, see "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer."

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     You have until 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, July 17, 2002
(the "Expiration Date"), to decide whether to tender your Shares in the Offer.
Further, if you cannot deliver everything required to make a valid tender to
Mellon Investor Services LLC, the depositary for the Offer, prior to such time,
you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure, which is described in
"The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares."

CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED AND, IF SO, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     We may extend the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement or as may be required
by applicable law. We may extend the Expiration Date if any of the conditions
specified in "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" are not satisfied at the
scheduled Expiration Date. In addition, if the Offer has not been consummated at
the Expiration Date due to the failure to satisfy the condition to the Offer
relating to the expiration of any waiting periods under applicable antitrust
laws, we will, at the request of the Company, extend the Expiration Date for one
or more periods (not in excess of ten business days each) but in no event later
than December 31, 2002.

     We may also elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" for the Offer.
A subsequent offering period, if we include one, will be an additional period of
time beginning after we have purchased Shares tendered during the Offer, during
which stockholders may tender their Shares and receive payment for Shares
validly tendered. If we decide to provide a subsequent offering period, we will
make a public announcement of our decision not later than 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the business day after the Expiration Date. We do not currently
intend to include a subsequent offering period, although we reserve the right to
do so. See "The Offer -- Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date."

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If we decide to extend the Offer, we will inform Mellon Investor Services
LLC, the depositary for the Offer, of that fact and will make a public
announcement of the extension, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the business day after the day on which the Offer was scheduled to expire.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY OPTIONS IN THE OFFER?

     We are not offering to purchase any options of the Company in the Offer. If
you wish to tender option shares in the Offer, you must exercise those options
and comply with the tender procedures described herein. In connection with the
merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the "Merger"), we have agreed to
assume each outstanding option to purchase Shares under any plan, agreement or
arrangement pursuant to which options to purchase Shares or other equity
interests of the Company have been granted. See "The Offer -- The Merger
Agreement; Other Arrangements."

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender Shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your
Shares, together with a completed Letter of Transmittal, to Mellon Investor
Services LLC, the depositary for the Offer, not later than the time the Offer
expires. If your Shares are held in street name by your broker, dealer,
commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, such nominee can tender your
Shares through The Depository Trust Company. If you cannot deliver everything
required to make a valid tender to the depositary prior to the expiration date
of the Offer, you may have a limited amount of additional time by having a
broker, a bank or other fiduciary which is a member of the Securities Transfer
Agents Medallion Program or another eligible institution guarantee that the
missing items will be received by the depositary within three Nasdaq National
Market trading days after the expiration of the Offer. The depositary must
receive the missing items within that three trading-day period for the tender to
be valid. See "The Offer -- Procedures for Tendering Shares."

UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW TENDERED SHARES?

     You can withdraw tendered Shares at any time until the Offer has expired.
If we decide to provide a subsequent offering period, we will accept Shares
tendered during that period immediately and thus you will not be able to
withdraw Shares tendered in the Offer during any subsequent offering period. See
"The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights."

HOW DO I WITHDRAW TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw Shares, you must deliver a written notice of withdrawal, or a
facsimile of one, with the required information to Mellon Investor Services LLC,
the depositary for the Offer, while you have the right to withdraw the Shares.
If you tendered your Shares by giving instructions through a broker or nominee,
you must instruct your broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other
nominee to arrange for the withdrawal of your Shares. See "The
Offer -- Withdrawal Rights."

WHEN AND HOW WILL I BE PAID FOR MY TENDERED SHARES?

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, we will pay for all
validly tendered and not withdrawn Shares promptly after the Expiration Date. We
will pay for your validly tendered and not

withdrawn Shares by depositing the purchase price with Mellon Investor Services
LLC, the depositary for the Offer, which will act as your agent for the purpose
of receiving payments from us and transmitting such payments to you. In all
cases, payment for tendered Shares will be made only after timely receipt by
Mellon Investor Services LLC of certificates for such Shares (or of a
confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares as described in "The
Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares"), a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other required documents for such Shares.

WILL THE OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER?

     Yes, unless the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied and not waived.
If we accept for payment and pay for at least such number of Shares that
satisfies the Minimum Condition and the other conditions are satisfied or
waived, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company. If the Merger takes
place, Novell will own all of the Shares of the Company and all remaining
stockholders of the Company, other than the Company's dissenting stockholders
who properly exercise appraisal rights, will receive $9.00 per share in cash.
See the "Introduction" to this Offer to Purchase. See also "The Offer -- The
Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements" for a description of the conditions to the
Merger.

WILL THE COMPANY CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY AFTER THE OFFER?

     Yes; however, if and when the Merger takes place, the Shares will no longer
be publicly traded. In addition, it is possible that, following the Expiration
Date but prior to the consummation of the Merger, there may be so few remaining
stockholders and publicly held Shares that:

     - the Shares will no longer be eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq National
       Market or any securities exchange;

     - there may not be an active public trading market, or, possibly, any
       public trading market, for the Shares; and

     - the Company may cease making filings with the SEC or otherwise cease
       being subject to the SEC rules relating to publicly held companies.

See "The Offer -- Effect of the Offer on the Market for the Shares; Nasdaq
Listing; Registration under the Exchange Act."

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     If the Merger takes place, stockholders not tendering in the Offer will
receive the same amount of cash per Share that they would have received had they
tendered their Shares in the Offer, subject to any appraisal rights properly
exercised under the DGCL. Therefore, if the Merger takes place and you do not
exercise appraisal rights, the only difference to you between tendering your
Shares and not tendering your Shares is that you will be paid earlier if you
tender your Shares. However, if the Merger does not take place and the Offer is
consummated, the number of stockholders and Shares that are still in the hands
of the public may be so small that there will no longer be an active public
trading market, or, possibly, any public trading market, for the Shares, which
may affect prices at which Shares trade. Also, as described above, the Company
may cease making filings with the SEC or otherwise cease being subject to the
SEC rules relating to publicly held companies.

ARE APPRAISAL RIGHTS AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH EITHER THE OFFER OR THE
MERGER?

     Appraisal rights are not available in connection with the Offer. If the
Merger is consummated, holders of Shares at the effective time of the Merger who
do not vote in favor of the Merger will have the right under Section 262 of the
DGCL to demand appraisal of their Shares. Under Section 262, stockholders who
demand appraisal and comply with the applicable statutory procedures will be
entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of their Shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the Merger, and to receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with
a fair rate of interest, if any. The value so determined could be more or less
than or equal to the

price per Share to be paid in the Merger. See "The Offer -- Purpose and
Structure of the Offer; Plans for the Company; Appraisal Rights" for a more
detailed discussion and Schedule II to this Offer to Purchase for the complete
text of Section 262 of the DGCL.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On June 7, 2002, the last full trading day before we announced the
execution of the Merger Agreement, the closing price of a Share on the Nasdaq
National Market was $5.14. On June 17, 2002, the last full trading day before
the date of this Offer to Purchase, the closing price of a Share on the Nasdaq
National Market was $8.91. We recommend that you obtain a recent quotation for
Shares before deciding whether to tender your Shares.

WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TENDERING MY
SHARES?

     The receipt of cash for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. In general,
a stockholder who tenders Shares in the Offer or receives cash in exchange for
Shares in the Merger will recognize gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares tendered in the
Offer or exchanged for cash in the Merger. If the Shares tendered or exchanged
constitute capital assets in the hands of the stockholder, such gain or loss
will be capital gain or loss. In general, capital gains recognized by an
individual will be subject to a maximum United States federal income tax rate of
20% if the Shares were held for more than one year. See "The Offer -- Certain
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations."

WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

     You can call Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the information agent for the
Offer, at (877) 456-3427 (toll free). See the back cover of this Offer to
Purchase.

To the Holders of Common Stock of SilverStream Software, Inc.:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     We are Novell, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Novell"). Through our
wholly-owned subsidiary Delaware Planet Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Purchaser"), we hereby offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), of SilverStream
Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), at the price of $9.00
per Share net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase and in the related
Letter of Transmittal (which together, as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, constitute the "Offer").

     The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of June 9, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Novell and
Purchaser. The Merger Agreement provides that, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer and satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger,
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at
the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Novell, the
Company or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, all of which will
be canceled, and Shares held by the Company's stockholders, if any, who properly
exercise their appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL")), will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 per Share in cash or
any higher per Share price paid in the Offer, net without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). The Merger Agreement is more fully described in "The
Offer -- The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements."

     If you tender your Shares to Purchaser in the Offer, you will not be
obligated to pay brokerage fees, commissions or, except as set forth in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, transfer taxes on the sale of Shares
pursuant to the Offer. If you own your Shares through a broker or other nominee,
and your broker or other nominee tenders your Shares on your behalf, your broker
or other nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your
broker or other nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. We will pay
all charges and expenses of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. (the "Dealer Manager"),
Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "Depositary") and Innisfree M&A Incorporated
(the "Information Agent") incurred in connection with the Offer. See "The
Offer -- Fees and Expenses."

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, AT A MEETING DULY CALLED AND HELD ON
JUNE 9, 2002, HAS UNANIMOUSLY (1) DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, ARE FAIR
TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS, (2) APPROVED THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER,
THE MERGER AND NOVELL'S ACQUISITION OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE STOCKHOLDER'S
AGREEMENTS (AS DEFINED BELOW), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DGCL, AND (3) RECOMMENDED
TO THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS THAT THEY ACCEPT THE OFFER, TENDER THEIR SHARES IN
THE OFFER AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE OFFER, PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE
AND NOT WITHDRAWN, A NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES THEN OWNED
BY NOVELL AND/OR PURCHASER OR ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY OF NOVELL, REPRESENTS AT
LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A FULLY-DILUTED BASIS (THE
"MINIMUM CONDITION"), AND (2) THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF ANY AND ALL
WAITING PERIODS UNDER APPLICABLE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE OFFER IS ALSO SUBJECT TO
OTHER CONDITIONS. SEE "THE OFFER -- CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER."

     The Company has advised us that as of June 9, 2002, there were issued and
outstanding 22,708,605 Shares and stock options to purchase 5,661,109 Shares (of
which options to purchase 1,808,791 Shares were exercisable, approximately half
of which had exercise prices of $9.00 per Share or less), and approximately
220,000 shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. Immediately prior to the commencement of the Offer, Novell and
its subsidiaries

beneficially owned no Shares, except for 4,611,413 Shares (representing
approximately 20% of the outstanding Shares or approximately 16% of the Shares
on a fully-diluted basis) deemed to be beneficially owned by virtue of the
Stockholder's Agreements (as defined below). Accordingly, we believe that the
Minimum Condition would be satisfied if 14,294,858 Shares, including those
subject to the Stockholder's Agreements, are validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer.

     In order to induce us to enter into the Merger Agreement, 11 stockholders
of the Company (the "Support Stockholders") consisting of all of the Company's
directors, certain of their respective affiliates and certain of the Company's
executive officers owning in the aggregate approximately 20% of the issued and
outstanding Shares (or approximately 16% of the Shares on a fully-diluted
basis), have each entered into a Stockholder's Agreement dated as of June 9,
2002 (each, a "Stockholder's Agreement") with Novell and Purchaser pursuant to
which the Support Stockholders have, subject to certain limitations, (i) agreed
to tender and sell 4,611,413 Shares (the "Subject Shares") to Novell pursuant to
the Offer, (ii) agreed not to withdraw any Subject Shares tendered in the Offer,
(iii) agreed to vote such Subject Shares in favor of the Merger and the Merger
Agreement and against any acquisition proposal other than the Merger, (iv)
granted to Novell an option to purchase the Subject Shares under certain
conditions and (v) granted to Novell, Purchaser and their nominees an
irrevocable proxy to vote such Subject Shares in favor of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For a discussion of the Stockholder's
Agreements, see "The Offer -- The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements -- The
Stockholder's Agreements."

     The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions,
including, if required, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares. If the Minimum
Condition is satisfied and we acquire Shares pursuant to the Offer, we would
have sufficient voting power to adopt the Merger Agreement without the
affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the Company. The Company has also
agreed, if required, to cause a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon
as reasonably practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement. We have
agreed to vote all Shares that we acquire in the Offer in favor of adoption of
the Merger Agreement. See "The Offer -- The Merger Agreement; Other
Arrangements."

     After expiration or termination of the Offer, we may seek to acquire
additional Shares, through open market purchases, block trades, privately
negotiated transactions, a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, upon
such terms and at such prices as we may determine, which may be more or less
than the price offered or paid per Share pursuant to the Offer and could be for
cash or other consideration.

THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT
INFORMATION, AND YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ BOTH IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE YOU
MAKE A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

                                   THE OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER; EXPIRATION DATE.

     On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer
(including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of
such extension or amendment), Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all
Shares that are validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not properly
withdrawn.

     "Expiration Date" means 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, July
17, 2002, unless we extend the period of time for which the Offer is open, in
which event "Expiration Date" means the latest time and date at which the Offer,
as so extended, shall expire.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) the Minimum
Condition having been satisfied and (2) the expiration or termination of any and
all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws. The Offer is also subject
to other conditions as described in "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer." If
any such condition is not satisfied, we may: (a) terminate the Offer and return
all tendered Shares; (b) extend the Offer and, subject to certain conditions and
to your withdrawal rights as set forth in "The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights,"
retain all Shares until the expiration date of the Offer as so extended; or (c)
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the
requirement that we obtain the Company's consent to waive the Minimum Condition,
and to any requirement to extend the period of time during which the Offer must
remain open, waive such condition and purchase all Shares validly tendered prior
to the Expiration Date and not withdrawn or delay acceptance for payment or
payment for Shares, subject to applicable law, until satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the Offer. For a description of our right to extend, amend,
delay or terminate the Offer, see "The Offer -- Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment," "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" and "The
Offer -- The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements."

     On the date of this Offer to Purchase, we do not beneficially own any
Shares, except for 4,611,413 Shares (representing approximately 20% of the
outstanding Shares or approximately 16% of the Shares on a fully-diluted basis)
deemed to be beneficially owned by virtue of the Stockholder's Agreements. For a
discussion of the Stockholder's Agreements, see "The Offer -- The Merger
Agreement; Other Arrangements -- The Stockholder's Agreements." The Company has
advised us that as of June 9, 2002, 28,589,714 Shares were issued and
outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. For purposes of the Minimum Condition, the
calculation of Shares issued and outstanding on a "fully-diluted basis" assumes
that all outstanding stock options, warrants and other rights are presently
exercisable in full.

     Under Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, we may, subject to certain
conditions, provide a subsequent offering period from three to 20 business days
in length following the expiration of the Offer on the Expiration Date. A
subsequent offering period would be an additional period of time, following the
expiration of the Offer and the purchase of Shares in the Offer, during which
stockholders may tender Shares not tendered in the Offer. A subsequent offering
period, if one is included, is not an extension of the Offer, which already will
have been completed.

     We reserve the right to include a subsequent offering period in the Offer.
Pursuant to Rule 14d-7 under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights apply to
Shares tendered during a subsequent offering period and no withdrawal rights
apply during the subsequent offering period with respect to Shares tendered in
the Offer and accepted for payment. We will pay the same consideration to all
stockholders tendering Shares in the Offer or in a subsequent offering period,
if we include one.

2. EXTENSION OF TENDER PERIOD; TERMINATION; AMENDMENT.

     We reserve the right to extend the Expiration Date, in our reasonable
discretion, if at the scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions to the
Offer have not been satisfied or waived. In addition, if the Offer has not been
consummated at the Expiration Date due to the failure to satisfy the condition
to the Offer relating to the expiration or termination of any waiting periods
under applicable antitrust laws, we

will, at the request of the Company, extend the Expiration Date for one or more
periods (not in excess of ten business days each) but in no event later than
December 31, 2002. We also have the right to extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the SEC Staff applicable to the Offer or
any period required by applicable law. Except as described in the next
paragraph, we expressly reserve the right in our reasonable discretion to waive
any of the conditions to the Offer, to make any change in the terms of our
conditions to the Offer and to provide a subsequent offering period for the
Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

     We will not, however, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i)
decrease the price per Share to be paid in the Offer, (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) decrease the number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) waive the Minimum Condition, (v) impose
additional conditions to the Offer or (vi) amend any other term of the Offer in
any manner adverse to the holders of Shares.

     If we increase or decrease the percentage of Shares being sought or
increase or decrease the consideration to be paid for Shares pursuant to the
Offer and the Offer is scheduled to expire at any time before the expiration of
ten business days from, and including, the date that notice of such increase or
decrease is first published, sent or given in the manner specified below, the
Offer will be extended until the expiration of ten business days from, and
including, the date of such notice. If we make a material change in the terms of
the Offer (other than a change in price or percentage of securities sought) or
in the information concerning the Offer, or waive a material condition of the
Offer, we will extend the Offer to the extent required by applicable law. In a
published release, the SEC has stated its view that an offer must remain open
for a minimum period of time following a material change in the terms of such
offer and that the waiver of a condition, such as the Minimum Condition, is a
material change in the terms of an offer. The release states that an offer
should remain open for a minimum of five business days from the date the
material change is first published, sent or given to stockholders, and that if
material changes are made with respect to information that approaches the
significance of price or percentage of Shares sought, a minimum of ten business
days may be required to allow adequate dissemination and investor response.
"Business day" means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday
and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 Midnight, New York
City time.

     Any extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be followed as
promptly as practicable by public announcement, in the case of an extension of
the Offer to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next
business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date, in accordance with
the public announcement requirements of Rule 14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act.
Subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the
Exchange Act, which require that material changes in the information published,
sent or given to any stockholders in connection with the Offer be promptly
disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform them of
such changes), and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make
any public announcement, we have no obligation to publish, advertise or
otherwise communicate any public announcements other than by issuing a press
release to the Dow Jones News Service.

     If we extend the time during which the Offer is open, or if we are delayed
in our acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer
for any reason, then, without prejudice to our rights under the Offer, the
Depositary may retain tendered Shares on our behalf and those Shares may not be
withdrawn except to the extent tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal
rights as described herein under "The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights." Our ability
to delay the payment for Shares that we have accepted for payment is limited by
(i) Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which requires that a bidder pay the
consideration offered or return the securities deposited by or on behalf of
stockholders promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the bidder's offer
and (ii) the terms of the Merger Agreement, which require that Purchaser pay for
Shares that are tendered pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
Expiration Date provided that all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
properly waived.

     The Company has provided us with the Company's stockholder list and
security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders
of Shares. This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal and
other related documents will be mailed to record holders of Shares whose names
appear on the Company's stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent
transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial
banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose
nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as
participants in a clearing agency's security position listing.

3. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment), we will accept for payment and pay for all Shares that are
validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as we are permitted to do so under applicable law,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer." In addition, we reserve the right, subject to
the Merger Agreement and compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act,
to delay the acceptance for payment or payment for Shares pending receipt of any
regulatory or governmental approvals to the Offer as described under the caption
"The Offer -- Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals." For a description of
our right to terminate the Offer and not accept for payment or pay for Shares or
to delay acceptance for payment or payment for Shares, see "The
Offer -- Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment."

     For purposes of the Offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for payment
tendered Shares when, as and if we give oral or written notice of our acceptance
to the Depositary. We will pay for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer by depositing the purchase price with the Depositary. The Depositary will
act as your agent for the purpose of receiving payments from us and transmitting
such payments to you. In all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary
of certificates for such Shares (or of a confirmation of a book-entry transfer
of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
(as defined in "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares")), a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or an Agent's Message in
connection with a book-entry transfer of Shares) and any other required
documents. Accordingly, payment may be made to tendering stockholders at
different times if delivery of the Shares and other required documents occurs at
different times. For a description of the procedure for tendering Shares
pursuant to the Offer, see "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares."

     Under no circumstances will we pay interest on the consideration paid for
Shares pursuant to the Offer, regardless of any delay in making such payment. If
we increase the consideration to be paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer, we
will pay such increased consideration for all Shares purchased pursuant to the
Offer.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, we reserve the
right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or
more of our subsidiaries the right to purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve us of our
obligations under the Offer or prejudice your rights to receive payment for
Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment. If any tendered Shares are not
purchased pursuant to the Offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted
for more Shares than are tendered, certificates for such unpurchased or
untendered Shares will be returned (or, in the case of Shares tendered by
book-entry transfer, such Shares will be credited to an account maintained at
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as defined below), without expense to you, as
promptly as practicable following the expiration or termination of the Offer.

4. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES.

     Except for Shares tendered by book-entry transfer, to tender Shares, either
(1) the Depositary must receive at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover of this Offer to Purchase (A) a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof) and any other documents

required by the Letter of Transmittal and (B) certificates for the Shares to be
tendered by the Expiration Date, or (2) the guaranteed delivery procedure
described below must be complied with.

     Book-Entry Delivery.  The Depositary will establish an account with respect
to the Shares at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer
Facility") for purposes of the Offer within two business days after the date of
this Offer to Purchase, and any financial institution that is a participant in
the system of the Book-Entry Transfer Facility may make delivery of Shares by
causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such Shares into the
Depositary's account in accordance with the procedures of the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility. However, although delivery of Shares may be effected through
book-entry transfer, the Letter of Transmittal properly completed and duly
executed together with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's Message
and any other required documents must, in either case, be received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to
Purchase by the Expiration Date, or the guaranteed delivery procedure described
below must be complied with. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
FACILITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY. "Agent's Message" means
a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and received by,
the Depositary and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation that states that
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility tendering the Shares that are
the subject of such book-entry confirmation which such participant has received,
and agrees to be bound by, the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that
Purchaser may enforce such agreement against such participant.

     Signature Guarantees.  Except as otherwise provided below, all signatures
on a Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a financial institution
(including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that
is a member of a recognized Medallion Program approved by The Securities
Transfer Association, Inc. or any other "eligible guarantor institution" (as
such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act) (each an "Eligible
Institution"). Signatures on a Letter of Transmittal need not be guaranteed (1)
if the Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder of the Shares
tendered therewith and such holder has not completed the box entitled "Special
Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (2) if such Shares are
tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. See Instructions 1 and 5 of
the Letter of Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If you wish to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer
and cannot deliver such Share Certificates and all other required documents to
the Depositary by the Expiration Date, or cannot complete the procedure for
delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, you may nevertheless tender
such Shares if all of the following conditions are met:

     - such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

     - a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in
       the form provided by Purchaser is received by the Depositary (as provided
       below) by the Expiration Date; and

     - the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation), together with a
       properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile
       thereof) with any required signature guarantee or an Agent's Message and
       any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal, are received
       by the Depositary within three Nasdaq National Market trading days after
       the date of execution of the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted
by facsimile transmission or mailed to the Depositary and must include a
guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in such Notice.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS,
INCLUDING THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT YOUR OPTION AND RISK,
AND THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY. IF CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES ARE SENT BY MAIL, WE RECOMMEND REGISTERED
MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD
ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     Back-up Withholding.  Under the United States federal income tax laws, the
Depositary may be required to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments
made to certain stockholders pursuant to the Offer or the Merger. In order to
avoid such back-up withholding, you must provide the Depositary with your
correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") and certify that you are not
subject to such back-up withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9
included in the Letter of Transmittal. Certain stockholders (including, among
others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not
subject to back-up withholding. If a stockholder does not provide its correct
TIN or fails to provide the certifications described above, the Internal Revenue
Service may impose a penalty on the stockholder and payment of cash to the
stockholder pursuant to the Offer may be subject to back-up withholding. All
stockholders tendering Shares pursuant to the Offer should complete and sign the
Substitute Form W-9 included in the Letter of Transmittal to provide the
information necessary to avoid back-up withholding. If you are a non-resident
alien or foreign entity not subject to back-up withholding, you must give the
Depositary a properly completed, appropriate version of Form W-8 Certificate of
Foreign Status or successor form in order to avoid backup withholding with
respect to payments made to you.

     Grant of Proxy.  By executing a Letter of Transmittal (or delivering an
Agent's Message), you irrevocably appoint our designees as your attorneys and
proxies in the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal to the full extent
of your rights with respect to the Shares tendered and accepted for payment by
us (and any and all other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in
respect of such Shares on or after the date of this Offer to Purchase). All such
attorneys and proxies are irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the
tendered Shares. Such appointment is effective only upon our acceptance for
payment of such Shares. The Offer does not constitute a solicitation of proxies,
absent a purchase of Shares, for any meeting of the Company's stockholders,
which will be made only pursuant to separate proxy solicitation materials
complying with the Exchange Act. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior
proxies and consents granted by you with respect to such Shares and other
securities will, without further action, be revoked, and no subsequent proxies
may be given nor subsequent written consents executed (and, if previously given
or executed, will cease to be effective). Our designees will be empowered to
exercise all your voting and other rights as they, in their sole discretion, may
deem proper at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of the Company's
stockholders, by written consent or otherwise. We reserve the right to require
that, in order for Shares to be validly tendered, immediately upon our
acceptance for payment of such Shares, we are able to exercise full voting
rights with respect to such Shares and other securities (including voting at any
meeting of stockholders then scheduled or acting by written consent without a
meeting).

     The tender of Shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described above
will constitute your acceptance of the Offer, as well as your representation and
warranty that (1) you own the Shares being tendered and (2) you have the full
power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares tendered, as
specified in the Letter of Transmittal. Our acceptance for payment of Shares
tendered by you pursuant to the Offer will constitute a binding agreement
between us with respect to such Shares, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer.

     Validity.  We will determine, in our reasonable discretion, all questions
as to the form of documents and the validity, eligibility (including time of
receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of Shares, and our
determination shall be final and binding. We reserve the absolute right to
reject any or all tenders of Shares that we determine not to be in proper form
or the acceptance for payment of or payment for which may, in the opinion of our
counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any defect or
irregularity in any tender of Shares. Our interpretation of the terms and
conditions of the Offer will be final and binding. None of Novell, Purchaser,
the Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person
will be under any duty to give notification of any defect or irregularity in
tenders or waiver of any such defect or irregularity or incur any liability for
failure to give any such notification.

5. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     You may withdraw tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer at any time
prior to the Expiration Date. Thereafter, such tenders are irrevocable, except
that they may be withdrawn after August 16, 2002 unless such Shares are accepted
for payment as provided in this Offer to Purchase. If we extend the period of
time during which the Offer is open, are delayed in accepting for payment or
paying for Shares pursuant to the Offer for any reason, or are unable to accept
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice
to our rights under the Offer, the Depositary may, on our behalf, retain all
Shares tendered, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except as otherwise
provided in this section. Any such delay will be accompanied by an extension of
the Offer to the extent required by law.

     To withdraw tendered Shares, a written or facsimile transmission notice of
withdrawal with respect to the Shares must be timely received by the Depositary
at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase,
and the notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered
the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of
the registered holder of Shares, if different from that of the person who
tendered such Shares. If the Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered to the
Depositary, a signed notice of withdrawal with (except in the case of Shares
tendered by an Eligible Institution) signatures guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution must be submitted prior to the release of such Shares. In addition,
such notice must specify, in the case of Shares tendered by delivery of
certificates, the name of the registered holder (if different from that of the
tendering stockholder) and the serial numbers shown on the particular
certificates evidencing the Shares to be withdrawn or, in the case of Shares
tendered by book-entry transfer, the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares.
Withdrawals may not be rescinded, and Shares withdrawn will thereafter be deemed
not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be
re-tendered by again following one of the procedures described in "The Offer --
Procedure for Tendering Shares" at any time on or prior to the Expiration Date.

     We will determine, in our reasonable discretion, all questions as to the
form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal, and
our determination shall be final and binding. None of Novell, Purchaser, the
Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will
be under any duty to give notification of any defect or irregularity in any
notice of withdrawal or waiver of any such defect or irregularity or incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification.

     If we provide a subsequent offering period following the Offer, no
withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered during that subsequent offering
period or to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment.

6. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

     The following summary of certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Offer and the Merger to United States Holders (as defined
below) is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
applicable Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations
thereof, each as in effect as of the date of this Offer to Purchase, all of
which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary assumes that
Shares are held as capital assets. It does not address all of the tax
consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their
individual circumstances, or to other types of stockholders who may be subject
to special rules (including, without limitation, certain financial institutions,
brokers, dealers or traders in securities or commodities, insurance companies,
"S" corporations, expatriates, tax-exempt organizations, Non-United States
Holders (as defined below), persons who are subject to alternative minimum tax,
persons who hold Shares as a position in a "straddle" or as part of a "hedging"
or "conversion" transaction, persons that have a functional currency other than
the United States dollar, persons who have a principal place of business or "tax
home" outside the United States, or persons who acquired their Shares upon the
exercise of stock options or otherwise as compensation). This summary also does
not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the Offer or the
Merger.

WE URGE EACH HOLDER OF SHARES TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE
UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER OR THE
MERGER TO SUCH HOLDER.

     A "United States Holder" is a holder of Shares that for United States
federal income tax purposes is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii) a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or any State or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or (iv) a trust (a) the administration over which a United States
court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions
of which one or more United States persons have the authority to control, and
certain other trusts considered United States Holders for federal income tax
purposes. A "Non-United States Holder" is a holder of Shares other than a United
States Holder.

     The receipt of cash in exchange of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax
purposes. In general, a United States Holder who sells Shares pursuant to the
Offer or receives cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will
recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the holder's
adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the Offer or exchanged for
cash pursuant to the Merger. Any such gain or loss would be long-term capital
gain or loss if the holding period for the Shares exceeded one year. Long-term
capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers are generally taxable at a maximum rate
of 20%. Capital gains of corporate stockholders are generally taxable at the
regular tax rates applicable to corporations. The deductability of capital
losses is subject to certain limitations.

     If the Merger is consummated, a United States Holder who exercises
appraisal rights and receives cash in exchange for its Shares will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the cash received
and the holder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor.

     THE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX
CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE OFFER OR THE MERGER, AND IS NOT
TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS
TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF TENDERING INTO THE OFFER OR
EXCHANGING SHARES PURSUANT TO THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

that they wished to explore further a relationship that could range from
licensing software to an acquisition. Mr. Klasson and Mr. Dynes agreed to
schedule a further meeting.

     On January 29, 2002, Mr. Dynes had a conference call with Mr. Klasson and

representatives of Novell to provide information concerning the Company and to
discuss a potential acquisition of the Company.

     On March 20, 2002, Novell delivered to Morgan Stanley a term sheet that
outlined preliminary draft terms for the acquisition of the Company by Novell,
subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence by Novell and
negotiation and execution of definitive documentation.

     On March 28, 2002, Mr. Smith of Novell had a conference call with Morgan
Stanley to discuss valuation issues.

     In early April 2002, representatives of the Company, Morgan Stanley and
Novell participated in various calls and meetings to discuss valuation and
acquisition terms.

     On April 16, 2002, Mr. Smith and Mr. Linsalata of Novell had a conversation
with Mr. Litwack and indicated that Novell might be willing to increase the
proposed acquisition price that Novell had discussed with the Company. The
proposed acquisition price was subject to change in response to fluctuations in
the trading price of the Company's common stock as a result of the announcement
of the Company's first quarter financial results, the satisfactory completion of
Novell's due diligence investigation and the negotiation of a merger agreement
and other documents.

     On April 16, 2002, Novell's Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled
meeting. Among the items discussed was Novell's potential acquisition of the
Company.

     Between April 25, 2002 and May 22, 2002, representatives of the Company and
Novell, together with their respective advisors, held numerous meetings and
teleconferences to discuss and review the Company's business, Novell's due
diligence investigation, the terms of the proposed Merger Agreement and various
other legal, regulatory and financial issues.

     On May 10, 2002, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, Novell's legal advisor,
provided the Company and the Company's legal advisors with an initial draft of
the Merger Agreement.

     On May 23, 2002, Mr. Litwack met with Messrs. Messman and Linsalata of
Novell. At this meeting, Mr. Messman informed Mr. Litwack that Novell was
prepared to move forward with discussions regarding the proposed acquisition.
Later that day, representatives of the Company and Morgan Stanley participated
in several telephone calls with representatives of Novell and its financial
advisor to discuss the proposed purchase price. At this time, the parties were
unable to agree on a proposed price, and negotiations and discussions between
the parties ceased.

     On May 30, 2002, Mr. Litwack received a voice mail message from Christopher
Stone, Vice Chairman, Office of the CEO, of Novell that resulted in a May 31,
2002 meeting at which the two companies reinstituted discussions.

     On May 31, 2002, Mr. Litwack and Mr. Stone met to reinstitute acquisition
discussions. The parties discussed a range of valuations, subject to the
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the satisfaction of certain other
conditions and negotiation of the Merger Agreement and other documents.

     From May 31, 2002 to June 3, 2002, representatives of Novell and its
financial advisor engaged in several telephonic discussions with representatives
of the Company and its financial advisors. As a result of these discussions,
Novell indicated that it was prepared to offer $9.00 per Share, subject to its
completion of additional due diligence and the negotiation of definitive
agreements.

     From June 4, 2002 to June 9, 2002, representatives of the Company and
representatives of Novell, together with their respective legal and financial
advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed Merger Agreement,
continued to conduct due diligence with respect to the Company and negotiated
the terms of the proposed Stockholder's Agreements.

     On June 7, 2002, at a special telephonic meeting, Novell's management and
legal advisors presented to the Novell Board of Directors various materials
concerning the Company and outlined the terms of the proposed acquisition
transaction. The Novell Board of Directors then authorized management to
finalize any remaining issues and to pursue the transaction substantially as
presented to the board.

     As an inducement for Novell and Purchaser to enter into the Merger
Agreement, on June 9, 2002, Novell and Purchaser entered into Stockholder's
Agreements with the Company's directors, certain entities affiliated with such
directors and certain executive officers of the Company. The Company, Novell and
Purchaser then entered into the Merger Agreement on June 9, 2002.

     On June 10, 2002, Novell and the Company issued a joint press release
announcing the Merger Agreement and the Offer.

     On June 18, 2002, Purchaser and Novell commenced the Offer.

12. THE MERGER AGREEMENT; OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO filed with the SEC. The summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

OVERVIEW

     Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Novell and
the Company are required to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the commencement by
Purchaser of the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment or pay
for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject only to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 16 of this Offer to
Purchase. The conditions described in Section 16, except for the Minimum
Condition, are for the sole benefit of Novell and may be asserted by Novell
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such

conditions and may be waived by Novell, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time, prior to the expiration of the Offer, in its reasonable
discretion.

     As inducement to Novell to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Support
Stockholders entered into Stockholder's Agreements with Novell and Purchaser
under which each Support Stockholder has, among other things, agreed to tender
such Support Stockholder's Shares in the Offer upon the terms and conditions set
forth therein. For additional information see "The Stockholder's Agreements"
below.

     In the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as
practicable after the Offer is commenced, it will file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 containing the recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors
that the Company's stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares in the
Offer and adopt the Merger Agreement.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The Merger.  The Merger Agreement provides that, if all of the conditions
to the Merger have been fulfilled or waived and the Merger Agreement has not
been terminated, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, and the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Novell.

     At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
thereto (other than Shares owned by the Company by Novell or any subsidiary of
Novell, all of which will be canceled, and Shares held by stockholders who
properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL) will, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive a cash payment of $9.00 (or such higher amount as may
be paid by Purchaser in the Offer) net without any interest thereon. Each share
of common stock of Purchaser outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically be converted at the Effective Time into one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     The Merger Agreement provides that upon acceptance for payment of, and
payment by Novell in accordance with the Offer for, any Shares, Novell will be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, as will give Novell representation on the Company's Board of Directors
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company's Board
of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant
to this provision) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Novell and/or Purchaser (including Shares accepted for
payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company will
take all action necessary to cause Novell's designees to be elected or
appointed, including seeking and accepting the resignations of the incumbent
directors or increasing the number of directors; provided, however, that
following the election or appointment of Novell's designees and until the
Effective Time, at least one member of the Company's Board of Directors will be
a Continuing Director (as defined below) and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least two Continuing Directors shall
remain members of the Company's Board of Directors. At such time, the Company
will also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated by
Novell to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number,
on (i) each committee of the board (subject to any relevant independence
requirements) and (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company. Following the
election or appointment of Novell's designees pursuant to this provision and
until the Effective Time, (i) any termination of the Merger Agreement by the
Company, (ii) any amendment of the Merger Agreement requiring action by the
Company's Board of Directors, (iii) any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action under the Merger Agreement by Novell or Purchaser and (iv)
any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
the Merger Agreement for the benefit of the Company or other action by the
Company under the Merger Agreement, which materially adversely affects the
Company's stockholders other than Novell and Purchaser, will require the
approval of not less than a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office, which

majority shall include the concurrence of a majority of the directors who are
neither designated by Novell nor employed by the Company (the "Continuing
Directors").

     Recommendation.  The Company represents and warrants in the Merger
Agreement that the Company's Board of Directors at a meeting duly called and
held has:

          (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the
     transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
     fair to and in the best interests of the Company's stockholders;

          (ii) unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and Novell's
     acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Stockholder's Agreements, in
     accordance with the DGCL;

          (iii) unanimously resolved, subject to certain exceptions described
     below, to recommend to its stockholders that they accept the Offer, tender
     their Shares in the Offer and adopt the Merger Agreement; and

          (iv) taken all action necessary to render the limitations on business
     combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the
     Merger Agreement, the Stockholder's Agreements and the transactions
     contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Stockholder's Agreements.

     The Company's Board of Directors agreed not to withdraw or modify its
recommendation described above in a manner adverse to Novell, except that the
Company's Board of Directors shall be permitted to withdraw or modify its
recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer or the Merger in a manner
adverse to Novell or approve or recommend or enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) if the Company has complied
with the terms of the Merger Agreement. A withdrawal or modification of the
recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors in any manner adverse to
Novell, however, may give rise to certain termination rights on the part of
Novell under the Merger Agreement and the right to receive certain termination
fees as set forth therein. See "Termination" and "Termination Fee and Expenses"
below.

     Representations and Warranties.  In the Merger Agreement, the Company has
made customary representations and warranties to Novell, including but not

     Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement.  The Merger Agreement provides that
the Company will cause a meeting of its stockholders to be duly called and held
as soon as reasonably practicable after Purchaser accepts for payment and pays
for Shares pursuant to the Offer for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, unless the DGCL does not require a vote of stockholders of
the Company for consummation of the Merger. In connection with such meeting, the
Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the SEC, use its reasonable best
efforts to have cleared by the SEC and

thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as practicable a proxy statement
and all other proxy materials for such meeting and (ii) otherwise comply with
all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. At any such meeting, all of
the Shares then owned by Novell and by any of Novell's other subsidiaries or
affiliates will be voted in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser, or any other direct
or indirect subsidiary of Novell, acquires at least 90% of the outstanding
Shares, the Company, Purchaser and Novell will take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the acceptance for payment and purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer in accordance with the DGCL.

     No Solicitation.  The Merger Agreement provides that neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries will authorize or permit any of its or their
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect thereto, (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (v) fail to make, withdraw, or
modify in a manner adverse to Novell its recommendation to its stockholders
referred to above, or (vi) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company is not
prohibited (x) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Company's Board of
Directors will not withdraw or modify in an adverse manner its approval or
recommendation to the Company's stockholders except as set forth below) or (y)
in the event that a Superior Proposal is made and the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it would otherwise constitute a breach of its fiduciary duty to
stockholders, from withdrawing or modifying its recommendation to the Company's
stockholders prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, so long as
the Company continues to comply with all other provisions of the Merger
Agreement and so long as all the conditions to the Company's rights to terminate
the Merger Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions therein have
been satisfied (including the expiration of the 72-hour period described therein
and the payment of all amounts required thereunder).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Board of Directors, directly
or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (i) engage
in negotiations or discussions with any third party that, without prior
solicitation by or negotiation with the Company, has made a Superior Proposal,
(ii) furnish to such third party nonpublic information relating to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated as of January 30, 2002 between Novell and the Company (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Novell), (iii)
following receipt of such Superior Proposal, take and disclose to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
otherwise make disclosure to them, (iv) following receipt of such Superior
Proposal, fail to make, withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Novell its
recommendation to its stockholders and/or (v) take any non-appealable, final
action ordered to be taken by the Company by any court of competent
jurisdiction, but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iv) only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law.

     "Acquisition Proposal" is defined in the Merger Agreement as any
third-party offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect,
of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or
over 20% of any

class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
the assets of which, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20%
of the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a
self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries the assets of which,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of the Company, (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, sale of substantially all the assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries the assets of which,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of the Company or (iv) any other transaction the consummation of which
could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the Offer or Merger or that could reasonably be expected to dilute
materially the benefits to Novell of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     "Superior Proposal" is defined in the Merger Agreement as any bona fide,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for all of the outstanding Shares on
terms that the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith by a
majority vote after taking into account the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and considering all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable to the Company's
stockholders than as provided in the Merger Agreement and for which financing,
to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available by the Company's Board of Directors.

     The Merger Agreement requires the Company to advise Novell promptly (but in
no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or any of its
advisors of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
by any third party that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will provide such notice to Novell orally and in writing
the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal and the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. In addition, the
Company is required to keep Novell fully informed, on a current basis, of the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.

     Employee Benefit Matters.  Following the Effective Time and until December
31, 2002, Novell has agreed to provide, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to all individuals who are employees of the Company at the Effective
Time and whose employment continues following the Effective Time, such persons
being referred to as Continuing Employees, with: (i) substantially similar
compensation, employee benefits, and terms and conditions of employment, in the
aggregate, as Novell provides to similarly-situated employees of Novell; (ii)
compensation, employee benefits, and terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar in the aggregate, to those of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; or (iii) a combination of clauses (i)
and (ii); provided that compensation, employee benefits, and terms and
conditions of employment, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those
in effect for Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Following the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in
service or similar rule, and the approval of any insurance carrier, third-party
provider or the like with reasonable efforts of Novell, each Continuing Employee
will receive service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) for employment, compensation, and
employee benefit plan purposes with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, none
of the provisions contained in the Merger Agreement will operate to duplicate
any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or the funding of any such
benefit.

     Stock Options.  The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time,
each outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Company's 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan, the Company's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the eObject, Inc. 2000
Stock Plan (which was previously assumed by the Company) and the Bondi Software,
Inc. Employee Stock Option Plan (which was previously assumed by the Company),
whether or

not vested or exercisable, and each of the above option plans, will be assumed
by Novell in a transaction described in Section 424(a) of the Code. Each Company
stock option so assumed by Novell under the Merger Agreement will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company stock
option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) for that number of shares of Novell common stock equal to the product of
the number of Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company stock
option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Novell common stock issuable upon the
exercise of such assumed Company stock option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per Share at which such Company stock
option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio (as defined below), rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Novell will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deliver to the holders of Company stock options notices
describing the conversion of such Company stock options. The "Exchange Ratio" is
the number (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) determined by dividing $9.00,
or such higher price as is paid in the Offer, by the average closing price per
share of Novell common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the thirty
calendar days ending with the date that is two calendar days prior to the date
on which the Effective Time occurs. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than ten business days following the Effective Time,
Novell will file a registration statement or statements on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the shares of Novell common stock subject to
stock options assumed by Novell pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

     Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  The Merger Agreement provides that the
Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") will be terminated on the
date that Purchaser first accepts Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.
Prior to such termination, the Company will provide notice to each ESPP
participant of the termination of the ESPP and provide each participant with the
right to make a purchase under the ESPP on a date that is prior to the
termination of the ESPP based on the accumulated payroll deductions then
credited to the participant's account. After such purchase, no new payroll
contributions may be made to the ESPP and no purchases can be made under the
ESPP.

     Indemnity; Insurance.  The Merger Agreement provides that:

          (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
     will indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
     directors of the Company, each of whom is referred to as an "Indemnified
     Person," in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
     Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other
     applicable laws or provided under the Company's certificate of
     incorporation and bylaws in effect on June 9, 2002, provided that such
     indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to
     time under applicable law.

          (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
     will provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of
     acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
     Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and
     directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
     amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on June 9,
     2002, provided that the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay
     premiums in excess of 150% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
     last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Novell
     prior to June 9, 2002. This obligation shall be deemed to have been
     satisfied if the Surviving Corporation, Novell or the Company (with the
     prior written consent of Novell, such consent not to be unreasonably
     withheld) purchases a "tail" policy under the Company's existing directors'
     and officers' insurance policy that (i) has an effective term of six years
     from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently
     covered, or will be covered on or prior to the Effective Time, by the
     Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on June 9,
     2002 for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
     and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including without limitation
     coverage amounts) that are at least

     as favorable in the aggregate as the terms and conditions of the Company's
     directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on June 9, 2002.

          (c) Novell will not, and will cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
     for a period of six years after the Effective Time, take any action to
     alter or impair any exculpatory, expense advancement or indemnification
     provisions now existing in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
     the Company for the benefit of any individual who served as a director or
     officer of the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time, except for
     any changes that may be required in order to conform with changes in
     applicable law and any changes that do not affect the application of such
     provisions to acts or omissions of such individuals prior to the Effective
     Time.

          (d) If Novell, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
     assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
     be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
     or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
     properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
     extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
     assigns of Novell or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will
     assume the obligations described herein.

          (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person described in the Merger
     Agreement are in addition to any rights such person may have under the
     certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other applicable laws or under any
     agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries. These rights will survive consummation of the Merger and are
     intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

     Additional Covenants.  The Merger Agreement contains the following
additional covenants of the parties:

     - The Company and Novell will cooperate with one another (i) in connection
       with the preparation of the documents required to be filed by them with
       the SEC and the Offer Documents, (ii) in determining whether any action
       by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
       official, or authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals
       or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
       contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
       contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or
       making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
       therewith or with the documents required to be filed with the SEC and
       seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
       waivers.

     - Until the Effective Time and subject to applicable law, the Company has
       agreed to provide Novell with full access to the Company's books, records
       and facilities, and Novell has agreed to treat any information derived
       from that access as confidential.

     - The Company and Novell will promptly notify each other of:

          (a) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that
              the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
              with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

          (b) any notice or other communication from any governmental or
              regulatory agency or authority in connection with the transactions
              contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

          (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
              commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
              involving or otherwise affecting the Company, Novell or any of its
              respective subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of the Merger
              Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
              pursuant to the Merger Agreement, or that relate to the
              consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
              Agreement.

     - Novell and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any
       press release or making any public statement with respect to the Merger
       Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and, except as may be
       required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national

       securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any
       such public statement prior to such consultation.

     Conditions to the Merger.  The obligations of the Company, Novell and the
Purchaser to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

          (a) if required by the DGCL, the Merger Agreement shall have been
     adopted by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the DGCL;
     provided, however, that neither Novell nor the Purchaser may assert this
     condition if either of them or any of their respective affiliates shall
     have failed to vote the Shares held by it in favor of the adoption of the
     Agreement, and the Company may not assert this condition if it shall have
     failed to fulfill its obligations under the Merger Agreement to cause a
     meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
     the Merger Agreement;

          (b) no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment,
     injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the consummation of the Merger;

     party asserting this condition shall use reasonable best efforts to have
     such injunction, order or decree vacated; and

          (c) the Purchaser shall have purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer;
     provided, however, neither Novell nor the Purchaser may assert this
     condition if the Purchaser shall have failed, in violation of the terms of
     the Merger Agreement or the Offer, to purchase the Shares so tendered and
     not withdrawn.

     Termination.  The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any approval
of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

          (a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Novell;

          (b) by either the Company or Novell, if:

             (i) Novell shall not have purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer on
        or before December 31, 2002, which is referred to as the "Outside Date";
        provided that (A) the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant
        to this section shall not be available to any party whose failure to
        fulfill any obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the primary
        cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer to be consummated on
        or before such date and (B) if the waiting period (and any extension
        thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the
        Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
        "HSR Act") shall expire or terminate less than ten Business Days prior
        to the Outside Date, the right to terminate the Merger Agreement
        pursuant to this section shall not become effective until the tenth
        business day following the Outside Date;

             (ii) there shall be any law or regulation that makes acceptance for
        payment of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer or
        consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any
        judgment, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental body
        having competent jurisdiction enjoining Purchaser from accepting for
        payment of, and paying for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
        Company or Novell from consummating the Merger and such judgment,
        injunction, order or decree shall have become final and nonappealable;
        or

             (iii) prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares under the
        Offer, the Company's Board of Directors will have failed to make,
        withdrawn, or modified in a manner adverse to Novell, its approval or
        recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer or the Merger,
        provided that, in the case of any termination by the Company, (A) the
        Company pays any amounts due pursuant to, and at the times specified in,
        the Merger Agreement, (B) the Company notifies Novell, in writing and at
        least 72 hours prior to such termination, promptly of its intention to
        terminate the Merger Agreement and to enter into a binding written
        agreement

        concerning an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
        attaching the most current version of such agreement (or a description
        of all material terms and conditions thereof), and (C) Novell does not
        make, within 72 hours of receipt of such written notification, an offer
        that the Company's Board of Directors determines, in good faith after
        consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to
        the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, it being
        understood that the Company will not enter into any such binding
        agreement during such 72-hour period.

          (c) by Novell, if prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares
     under the Offer, any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) under
     the Exchange Act) (other than Novell, the Purchaser or any of their
     respective affiliates) shall have become the beneficial owner (as defined
     in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of at least a majority of
     the outstanding Shares;

          (d) by Novell, if prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares
     under the Offer, the Company will have breached in any material respect the
     obligations imposed upon it by the non-solicitation provisions of the
     Merger Agreement; or

          (e) by (i) Novell, if prior to the acceptance for payment of the
     Shares under the Offer, the Company will have breached any of the
     representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the
     Merger Agreement such that the condition specified in clause (e) of Annex I
     to the Merger Agreement is not capable of being satisfied on or prior to
     expiration date of the Offer or (ii) the Company, if prior to the
     acceptance for payment of the Shares under the Offer, Novell shall have
     breached any of its covenants or agreements contained in the Merger
     Agreement required to be performed by it prior to the acceptance for
     payment of the Shares under the Offer or any of its representations and
     warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach would reasonably
     be expected to materially impair the ability of Novell to consummate the
     transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     Termination Fee and Expenses.  The Merger Agreement provides that:

          (a) Except as otherwise provided below, all costs and expenses
     incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party
     incurring such cost or expense.

          (b) If a Payment Event (as defined below) occurs, the Company will pay
     to Novell (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), if, pursuant
     to (w) below, simultaneously with the occurrence of such Payment Event or,
     if pursuant to (x), (y) or (z) below, within two business days following
     such Payment Event, a fee of $7,434,000.

          "Payment Event" is defined in the Merger Agreement as (w) the
     termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to paragraph (b)(iii) in
     "Termination" above, (x) the termination of the Merger Agreement by Novell
     pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) in "Termination" above, (y) the
     termination of the Merger Agreement by Novell pursuant to paragraph (e)(i)
     in "Termination" above, except that such termination will not be considered
     a Payment Event if the breach causing such termination occurred through no
     fault of the Company and as a result of events occurring after June 9,
     2002, or (z) the occurrence of any of the following events within twelve
     months of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to paragraph
     (b)(i) in "Termination" above, provided that an Acquisition Proposal shall
     have been made after June 9, 2002 and prior to such termination (which
     shall not have been withdrawn in good faith prior to such termination): (i)
     the Company merges with or into, or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by
     merger or otherwise by, a third party; (ii) a third party, directly or
     indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the total assets of the Company and

     or 50% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (c) Upon any termination of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to
     paragraph (b)(i), (b)(iii), (c), (d) or (e)(i) in "Termination" above, the
     Company shall reimburse Novell and its affiliates (by wire transfer of
     immediately available funds), no later than two business days after
     submission of reasonable documentation thereof, for 100% of their
     documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
     expenses of their counsel and accountants) actually incurred by any of them
     in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
     hereby up to a maximum of $2,500,000.

THE STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Stockholder's
Agreements, a form of which is filed as an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO filed with the SEC. The summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the form of Stockholder's Agreement, which is incorporated by
reference herein. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Stockholder's Agreements.

     In order to induce Novell to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Support
Stockholders (who own in the aggregate approximately 20% of the issued and
outstanding Shares (or approximately 16% of the Shares on a fully-diluted
basis), have entered into Stockholder's Agreements, each dated as of June 9,
2002, with Novell and Purchaser pursuant to which the Support Stockholders have,
subject to certain limitations, (i) agreed to tender and sell 4,611,413 Shares
(the "Subject Shares") to Novell pursuant to the Offer, (ii) agreed not to
withdraw any Subject Shares tendered in the Offer, (iii) agreed to vote such
Subject Shares in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement and against any
acquisition proposal other than the Merger, (iv) granted to Novell an option to
purchase the Subject Shares under certain conditions and (v) granted to Novell,
Purchaser and their nominees an irrevocable proxy to vote such Subject Shares in
favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     Until the earliest to occur of (x) the termination of the Stockholder's
Agreement, (y) the expiration of the Stock Option (as defined below) and (z) the
closing of any exercise of such Stock Option, each Support Stockholder has
agreed to vote each of his or its respective Shares at any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, and in any action by consent of the
stockholders of the Company, (A) in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, (B) against any Acquisition Proposal and against any proposal for
action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company
under the Merger Agreement or which is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions of the Company's obligations under the Merger Agreement not being
fulfilled, any change in the directors of the Company, any change in the present
capitalization of the Company or any amendment to the Company's Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws,
any other material change in the Company's corporate structure or business or
any other action which in the case of each of the matters referred to in this
clause (B) could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay,
postpone or materially adversely affect the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or the likelihood of such transactions being consummated and
(C) in favor of any other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement that is considered at any such meeting of
stockholders or in such consent, and in connection therewith to execute any
documents which are necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the
foregoing, including the ability for Purchaser or its nominees to vote such
Shares directly.

     Each Support Stockholder has agreed to revoke any and all prior proxies or
powers of attorney in respect of any of the Subject Shares and has agreed to
irrevocably constitute and appoint Purchaser and Novell, or any nominee of
Purchaser and Novell, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, at any
time during the term of his or its respective Stockholder's Agreement, as its
true and lawful attorney and proxy (its "Proxy"), for and in its name, place and
stead, to vote each of the Subject Shares as his or its Proxy, at every annual,
special, adjourned or postponed meeting of the stockholders of the Company,
including the right to sign his or its name (as stockholder) to any consent,
certificate or other document relating to the Company and any matter referred to
above that the DGCL may permit or require.

     Under each Stockholder's Agreement, the Support Stockholder has granted to
Novell or Purchaser, as Novell may designate (the "Optionee"), an irrevocable
option (each such option, a "Stock Option") to purchase all, but not in any part
or less than all, of the Support Stockholder's Subject Shares (in such context,
the "Option Shares") at a purchase price per share equal to $9.00 (the "Exercise
Price"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Stockholder's Agreement.

     The Stock Option may be exercised by the Optionee in whole or from time to
time in part, at any time following the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as
defined below) and prior to the termination of the Stock Option in accordance
with Stockholder's Agreement.

     The Optionee's right to exercise the Stock Option is subject to the
following conditions:

          (i) neither Novell nor Purchaser shall have breached any of its
     obligations under the Merger Agreement such that the breach was the primary
     cause or resulted in the failure of the Offer to be consummated;

          (ii) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by
     any federal, state or foreign court of competent jurisdiction invalidating
     the grant or prohibiting the exercise of the Stock Option or the delivery
     of the Option Shares shall be in effect;

          (iii) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
     applicable foreign antitrust law or regulation shall have expired or been
     terminated; and

          (iv) a Triggering Event shall have occurred.

     A "Triggering Event" will be deemed to have occurred if the Merger
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to a section of the Merger Agreement that
results in the possibility of a termination fee being paid.

     Except as contemplated by the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the
Stockholder's Agreements, during the term of their respective Stockholder's
Agreement, each Support Stockholder has agreed not to (A) transfer, sell,
assign, gift, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose, or consent to any
transfer, sale, gift, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, any or all
of his or its respective Subject Shares or any interest therein, or create or
permit to exist any encumbrance on his or its Subject Shares, (B) enter into any
contract, option or other agreement or understanding with respect to any
transfer of any or all of his or its Subject Shares or any interest therein, (C)
grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization in or with respect to
his or its Subject Shares, (D) deposit his or its respective Subject Shares into
a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to
his or its Subject Shares or (E) take any other action that would in any way
restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of his or its obligations
under his or its Stockholder's Agreement or the transactions contemplated by his
or its Stockholder's Agreement or by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing limitations, however, the Support Stockholders may sell, transfer or
assign their respective Subject Shares to members of their families, a family
trust or a charitable institution if the transferee agrees in writing to be
bound by the terms of the Stockholder's Agreement and notice of the sale,
transfer or assignment is delivered to Purchaser.

     During the term of the Stockholder's Agreement, the Support Stockholders
have agreed not to and have agreed not to cause any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, the
"Representatives") to, (A) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Each Support Stockholder has agreed to and has agreed to
cause his or its respective Representatives to, immediately

cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to the date of his or its Stockholder's Agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

     To the same extent required by the Company pursuant to, and subject to the
same conditions contained in, the Merger Agreement, each Support Stockholder has
agreed to notify Novell promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
such Support Stockholder receives any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that
any third party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any third party that may be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. To the same extent required by the Company pursuant to,
and subject to the same conditions contained in, the Merger Agreement, each
Support Stockholder has agreed to provide such notice orally and in writing and
identify the third party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Support Stockholder or any of its Representatives is a member of the
Company's Board of Directors, such member of the Company's Board of Directors
may take actions in such capacity to the extent permitted by the Merger
Agreement.

     No Support Stockholder who executed a Stockholder's Agreement who is or
becomes during the term thereof a director or officer of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, made any agreement or understanding or is obligated
under the Stockholder's Agreement in his or her capacity as such director or
officer. Each Support Stockholder signed a Stockholder's Agreement solely in
such Support Stockholder's capacity as the record holder and beneficial owner of
the Stockholder's Shares. Nothing in the Stockholder's Agreements will be
construed to prohibit a Support Stockholder who is a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or officer of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company from taking any action or inaction
solely in such capacity or from taking any action or inaction with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise, as a member of, or at the direction of,
the Board of Directors of the Company to the extent permitted by the Merger
Agreement.

     Each Stockholder's Agreement terminates on the earlier of (A) the

MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Mutual
Non-Disclosure Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO filed with the SEC. The summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, which is
incorporated by reference herein.

     The Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated January 30, 2002, contains
customary provisions pursuant to which, among other matters, Novell and the
Company agreed to keep confidential all confidential information concerning the
Company or Novell, respectively, furnished to each party by the other, to use
such material solely in connection with evaluating or consummating an
acquisition of the Company by Novell, and, except with the prior written consent
of the other party, not to disclose the fact that discussions or negotiations
have or are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the Company
or the status thereof.

13. PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY; APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     Purpose of the Offer.  The purpose of the Offer is to acquire control of,
and ultimately the entire equity interest in, the Company. The Offer, as the
first step in the acquisition of the Company, is intended to facilitate the
acquisition of the Company. The purpose of the Merger is to acquire all
outstanding Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is
successful, Novell intends to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable.
If Novell owns 90% or more of the outstanding Shares, following consummation of
the Offer, Novell intends to consummate the Merger as a "short-form" merger
pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL. Under such circumstances, neither the
approval of any holder of Shares nor the Company's Board of Directors would be
required.

     If, following the consummation of the Offer, Novell owns less than 90% of
the outstanding Shares, the Company's Board of Directors will be required to
submit the Merger Agreement to the Company's stockholders for adoption at a
stockholders' meeting convened for that purpose in accordance with the DGCL. If
the Minimum Condition is satisfied, Novell will, upon consummation of the Offer,
have sufficient voting power to ensure adoption of the Merger Agreement at the
stockholders' meeting without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder.

     Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Novell.

     The Offer does not constitute a solicitation of proxies for any meeting of
the Company's stockholders. Any such solicitation which Novell might make would
be made only pursuant to separate proxy materials complying with the
requirements of the Exchange Act.

     Section 203 of the DGCL.  Section 203 of the DGCL prevents certain
"business combinations" with an "interested stockholder" (generally, any person
who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding
voting stock) for a period of three years following the time such person became
an interested stockholder unless, among other things, prior to the time the
interested stockholder became such, the board of directors of the corporation
approved either the business combination or the transaction in which the
interested stockholder became such. The Company's Board of Directors has
approved the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Stockholder's
Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby for the purposes of Section
203 of the DGCL. See "The Offer -- Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals."

  PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the completion of the Offer, we
intend to effect the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

     The Merger Agreement provides that, effective upon the consummation of the
Offer, Parent will be entitled to designate a number of directors (rounded up to
the nearest whole number) to the Company's Board of Directors in proportion to
the percentage of the total number of outstanding Shares of the Company owned by
Novell and its affiliates.

     Except as otherwise described in this Offer to Purchase and except for the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we have no current plans or
proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) an extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving the
Company; (b) a purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company; (c) any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or
indebtedness or capitalization of the Company; (d) any change in the present
board of directors or management of the Company or any change in any material
term of the employment contract of any executive officer; (e) any other material
change in the Company's corporate structure or business; (f) any class of equity
securities of the Company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or
cease to be authorized to be quoted in an automated quotations system operated
by a national securities association; or (g) any class of equity securities of
the Company becoming eligible for termination of registration under Section
12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act.

     Nevertheless, we may initiate a review of the Company and its assets,
corporate structure, capitalization, operations, properties, policies,
management and personnel to determine what changes, if any, would be desirable
following the Merger in order best to organize and coordinate the activities of
the Company and Novell.

     Appraisal Rights.  Appraisal rights are not available in the Offer. If the
Merger is consummated, however, holders of Shares at the effective time of the
Merger who do not vote in favor of, or consent to, the Merger will have the
right under Section 262 of the DGCL to demand appraisal of their Shares. Under
Section 262, stockholders who demand appraisal and comply with the applicable
statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the
fair value of their Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, and to receive

payment of that fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if
any. The value so determined could be more or less than or equal to the price
per Share to be paid in the Merger.

     The foregoing summary of Section 262 does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 attached hereto as
Schedule II. Failure to follow the steps that Section 262 requires for
perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of those rights.

14. EFFECT OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR THE SHARES; NASDAQ LISTING;
    REGISTRATION UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

     The purchase of Shares by us pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number
of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and may reduce the number of
holders of Shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value
of the remaining Shares held by the public.

     Depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and the
aggregate market value of any Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer, the
Shares may no longer meet the standards for continued listing on the Nasdaq
National Market and may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. The
published guidelines of the Nasdaq National Market indicate that the Nasdaq
National Market would consider delisting the Shares if, among other things,
either (1) the number of round lot holders of Shares should fall below 400, the
number of publicly held Shares should fall below 750,000, the aggregate market
value of the publicly held Shares should fall below $5,000,000, the minimum bid
price for Shares should fall below $1 per Share, the stockholders' equity in the
Company should fall below $10,000,000, and there should be less than two
registered and active market makers providing quotations for the Shares, or,
alternatively, (2) the market capitalization of the Company (or the Company's
total assets and total revenue for the last completed fiscal year, respectively)
should fall below $50,000,000, the number of round lot holders of Shares should
fall below 400, the number of publicly held Shares should fall below 1,100,000,
the aggregate market value of the publicly held Shares should fall below
$15,000,000, the minimum bid price for Shares should fall below $3 per Share and
there should be less than four registered and active market makers providing
quotations for the Shares.

     To the extent the Shares are delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the
market for the Shares could be adversely affected. If the Nasdaq National Market
were to delist the Shares, it is possible that the Shares would continue to
trade in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations for the Shares
would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public market for the
Shares and the availability of such quotations would, however, depend on the
number of holders of Shares remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining
a market in the Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination
of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act and other factors. Novell
cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that might
otherwise trade publicly, if any, effected by the Offer would have an adverse or
beneficial effect on the market price for or marketability of the Shares or
whether it would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the price
per Share to be paid in the Merger.

     The Shares are currently "margin securities," as such term is defined under
the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers
to extend credit on the collateral of such securities. Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding listing and market quotations,
following the Offer it is possible that the Shares might no longer constitute
"margin securities" for purposes of the margin regulations of the Federal
Reserve Board, in which event such Shares could no longer be used as collateral
for loans made by brokers.

     The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such
registration may be terminated upon application by the Company to the SEC if the
Shares are no longer authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market and
there are fewer than 300 record holders. The termination of the registration of
the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the information
required to be furnished by the Company to holders of Shares and to the SEC and
would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the short-swing
profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b), the requirement of furnishing a
proxy statement in connection with stockholders' meetings and the requirements
of Rule 13e-3 under the

Exchange Act with respect to "going private" transactions, no longer applicable
to the Shares. In addition, "affiliates" of the Company and persons holding
"restricted securities" of the Company may be deprived of the ability to dispose
of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If
registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, the Shares
would no longer be "margin securities" or be eligible for reporting on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System. We
presently intend to seek to cause the Company to terminate the registration of
the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon as possible after the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger as the requirements for termination of registration are
met.

15. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     If, during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period, the cash payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

16. CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject to applicable law, pay for any
Shares, and may terminate the Offer, if (i) immediately prior to the expiration
date of the Offer, (A) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, or
(B) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable foreign
antitrust law shall not have expired or been terminated or (ii) at any time on
or after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the expiration date of
the Offer, any of the following conditions exists and shall not have resulted

     obtain material damages or otherwise directly or indirectly relating to the

     subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to compel Novell or any of its
     affiliates to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of
     the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole, or of Novell and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) seeking to

     owned by Novell, Purchaser or any of Novell's other affiliates on all
     matters properly presented to the Company's stockholders, (v) seeking to
     require divestiture by Novell, Purchaser or any of Novell's other
     affiliates of any Shares or (vi) that otherwise, in the reasonable judgment

          (b) there shall have been any action taken, or any statute, rule,
     regulation, injunction, order or decree enacted, enforced, promulgated,
     issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, by any court,
     government or governmental authority or agency, domestic, foreign or
     supranational, other than the application of the waiting period provisions
     of the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust law to the Offer or the
     Merger, that, in the reasonable judgment of Novell, is likely, directly or
     indirectly, to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i)
     through (vi) of paragraph (a) above; or

          (c) any change shall have occurred or been threatened (or any

     capitalization, operations or results of operations of the Company or any
     of its subsidiaries that, in the reasonable judgment of Novell, is or is

     (including the Shares), other than acquisitions for bona fide arbitrage
     purposes only and other than as disclosed in a Schedule 13D or 13G on file
     with the SEC on June 7, 2002, or (ii) any such third party that, prior to
     June 7, 2002, had filed such a Schedule with the SEC shall have acquired
     beneficial ownership of additional shares of any class or series of capital
     stock of the Company (including the Shares), through the acquisition of

     adverse effect on bank syndication or financial markets in the United
     States or, in the case of any of the foregoing occurrences existing on or
     at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or
     worsening thereof; which, in the reasonable judgment of Novell in any such
     case, and regardless of the circumstances (including any action or omission
     by Novell) giving rise to any such condition, could reasonably be expected
     to have a material adverse effect on the Company or Novell or a material
     adverse effect on the Offer.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Novell and may be
asserted by Novell regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such
conditions, and except with respect to the Minimum Condition, may be waived by
Novell in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to the
expiration of the Offer, in each case, in the exercise of the good faith
judgment of Novell and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The failure
by Novell at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the
expiration of the Offer.

17. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

     General.  We are not aware of any governmental license or regulatory permit
that appears to be material to the Company's business that might be adversely
affected by our acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer or, except as set
forth below, of any approval or other action by any government or governmental
administrative or regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign, that
would be required for our acquisition or ownership of Shares pursuant to the
Offer. Should any such approval or other action be required, we currently
contemplate that such approval or other action would be sought. However, we do
not intend to delay the purchase of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
pending the outcome of any action or the receipt of any such approval. There can
be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be
obtained (with or without substantial conditions) or that if such approvals were
not obtained or such other actions were not taken adverse consequences might not
result to the Company's business or certain parts of the Company's business
might not have to be disposed of, any of which could cause us to elect to
terminate the Offer without the purchase of Shares thereunder. Our obligation
under the Offer to accept for payment and pay for Shares is subject to certain
conditions. See "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer."

     State Takeover Laws.  Section 203 of the DGCL, in general, prohibits a
Delaware corporation such as the Company from engaging in a "Business
Combination" (defined as a variety of transactions, including mergers) with an
"Interested Stockholder" (defined generally as a person that is the beneficial
owner of 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock) for a period
of three years following the time that such person became an interested
stockholder unless: (a) prior to the time such person became an interested
stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the
business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder; (b) upon consummation of the transaction
that resulted in the stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder, the
Interested Stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation
outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding stock held by
directors who are also officers of the corporation and employee stock plans that
do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether
shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer;
or (c) on or subsequent to the time such person became an Interested
Stockholder, the Business Combination is approved by the board of directors of
the corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders, and not by written
consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the Interested
Stockholder.

     The Company's Board of Directors has approved the Merger Agreement, the
Stockholder's Agreements, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL.

     The foregoing description of Section 203 does not purport to be complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of Section 203.

     The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and its
operations are conducted throughout the United States. A number of states have
adopted takeover laws and regulations that purport to be applicable to attempts
to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated in those states or
that have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or
principal places of business in those states. To the extent that these state
takeover statutes purport to apply to the Offer or the Merger, we believe that
those laws conflict with U.S. federal law and are an unconstitutional burden on
interstate commerce. In 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Edgar
v. MITE Corporation, invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business
Takeover Statute, which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of
corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. The reasoning in that
decision is likely to apply to certain other state takeover statutes. In 1987,
however, in CTS Corporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme
Court of the United States held that the State of Indiana could as a matter of
corporate law and, in particular, those aspects of corporate law concerning
corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from
voting on the affairs of a target corporation without the prior approval of the
remaining stockholders, as long as those laws were applicable only under

certain conditions. Subsequently, in TLX Acquisition Corporation v. Telex
Corporation, a federal district court in Oklahoma ruled that the Oklahoma
statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to corporations
incorporated outside Oklahoma, because they would subject those corporations to
inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds, a
federal district court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee takeover statutes
were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee.
This decision was affirmed by the United State Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. In December 1988, a federal district court in Florida held, in Grand
Metropolitan PLC v. Butterworth, that the provisions of the Florida Affiliated
Transactions Act and Florida Control Share Acquisition Act were unconstitutional
as applied to corporations incorporated outside of Florida.

     Except as described herein, we have not attempted to comply with any state
takeover statutes in connection with this Offer or the Merger. We reserve the
right to challenge the validity or applicability of any state law allegedly
applicable to the Offer or the Merger, and nothing in this Offer to Purchase nor
any action that we take in connection with the Offer is intended as a waiver of
that right. In the event that it is asserted that one or more takeover statutes
apply to the Offer or the Merger, and it is not determined by an appropriate
court that the statutes in question do not apply or are invalid as applied to
the Offer or the Merger, as applicable, we may be required to file certain
documents with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities, and
we might be unable to accept for payment or purchase Shares tendered in the
Offer or be delayed in continuing or consummating the Offer. In that case, we
may not be obligated to accept for purchase, or pay for, any Shares tendered.
See "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer."

     Antitrust.  Under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder
by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), certain acquisition transactions
may not be consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and
the FTC and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to such requirements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, each of Novell and the Company
intends to file a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Offer and the
Merger with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on or about June 21, 2002. As a
result, we anticipate that the waiting period applicable to the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on or about Monday, July 8, 2002. However, prior to such time, the
Antitrust Division or the FTC may extend the waiting period by formally
requesting additional information or documentary material relevant to the Offer
from us. If such a request is made, the waiting period will be extended until
11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth day after our substantial
compliance with such request. Thereafter, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may
defer the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby
only by court order. A request will be made pursuant to the HSR Act for early
termination of the waiting period applicable to the Offer. There can be no
assurance, however, that the HSR Act waiting period will be terminated early.

     Shares will not be accepted for payment or paid for pursuant to the Offer
until the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act. See "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer." Subject to
certain circumstances described in "The Offer -- Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment," any extension of the waiting period will not give rise
to any withdrawal rights not otherwise provided for by applicable law. If our
acquisition of Shares is delayed pursuant to a request by the Antitrust Division
or the FTC for additional information or documentary material pursuant to the
HSR Act, the Offer may be extended.

     The Antitrust Division and the FTC frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions such as Novell's acquisition of Shares
pursuant to the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation of any such
transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
seeking divestiture of the Shares so acquired or divestiture of Novell's or the
Company's substantial assets. Private parties (including individual states) may
also bring

legal actions under the antitrust laws. Novell does not believe that the
consummation of the Offer will result in a violation of any applicable antitrust
laws. However, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer on
antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the
result will be. See "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" for certain
conditions to the Offer, including conditions with respect to litigation and
certain governmental actions.

     Foreign Laws.  The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2001 indicates that the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries conduct business in foreign countries where regulatory filings or
approvals under antitrust and other laws may be required or desirable in
connection with the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Certain of such
filings for approvals, if required or desirable, may not be made or obtained
prior to the expiration of the Offer. After commencement of the Offer, Novell
will seek further information regarding the applicability of any such laws and
currently intends to take such action as may be required or desirable. If any
government or governmental authority or agency takes any action prior to the
completion of the Offer that might have certain adverse effects, Novell will not
be obligated to accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered.

18. FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Novell has retained Salomon Smith Barney Inc. to act as its financial
advisor and as Dealer Manager for the Offer, Innisfree M&A Incorporated to act
as the Information Agent and Mellon Investor Services LLC to act as the
Depositary in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, telephone, telex, telegraph and personal interviews
and may request brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and other nominees to
forward materials relating to the Offer to beneficial owners. Novell has agreed
to pay Salomon Smith Barney Inc. an aggregate fee of $1,650,000 upon
consummation of the Offer for its services, of which $350,000 will be paid for
Salomon Smith Barney Inc.'s services as Dealer Manager. Novell also has agreed
to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney Inc. for reasonable travel and other expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel), and to indemnify
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and certain related parties against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws arising out
of its engagement. The Information Agent and the Depositary each will receive
customary compensation for their respective services, will be reimbursed for
certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against
certain liabilities in connection therewith, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

     We will not pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or any
other person for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers,
dealers, commercial banks and trust companies will, upon request, be reimbursed
by us for reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in
forwarding materials to their customers.

19. MISCELLANEOUS.

     The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on
behalf of, holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the
Offer or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such
jurisdiction. However, we will make a good faith effort to take such action as
we may deem necessary to make the Offer in any such jurisdiction and extend the
Offer to holders of Shares in such jurisdiction.

     No person has been authorized to give any information or make any
representation on behalf of Novell or Purchaser not contained in this Offer to
Purchase or in the Letter of Transmittal and, if given or made, such information
or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized.

     We have filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO,
together with exhibits, pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the General Rules and
Regulations under the Exchange Act, furnishing certain additional information
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO and any amendments thereto, including
exhibits, may be examined and copies may be obtained from the offices of the SEC
in the manner set

forth in "The Offer -- Certain Information Concerning the Company -- Available
Information" of this Offer to Purchase.

                                  SCHEDULE II

             SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW --
                              RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to sec. 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to sec. 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to sec.
251(g) of this title), sec. 252, sec. 254, sec. 257, sec. 258, sec. 263 or sec.
264 of this title:

          (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of sec. 251 of this title.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     sec.sec. 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
        such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

             b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
        in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
        respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
        merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
        exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
        interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
        Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

             c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
        receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
        paragraph; or

             d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
        cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
        described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b., and c. of this
        paragraph.

          (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under sec. 253 of this title is not owned by the
     parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
     be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
                                       S-8

     (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

          (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

          (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to sec. 228
     or sec. 253 of this title, then, either a constituent corporation before
     the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or
     resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter, shall notify each of the
     holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who
     are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
     consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
     of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
     include in such notice a copy of this section. Such notice may, and, if
     given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall,
     also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20
     days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the
     surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares.
     Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
     the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
     demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either
     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
     determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
     constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
     not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
     if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
     date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the

                                       S-9

     effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
     next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

     (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

                                       S-10

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

     (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to Delaware Planet Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Novell"), the above-described shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share ("Shares") of SilverStream Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to Purchaser's offer to purchase all of
the outstanding Shares at $9.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to
Purchase dated June 18, 2002 (the "Offer to Purchase"), receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (which together, as each
may be amended or supplemented from time to time, constitute the "Offer").
Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, to one or more of its subsidiaries the right to purchase Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not
relieve Purchaser of its obligations under the Offer or prejudice the
undersigned's rights to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted
for payment.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (and if the Offer
is extended or amended, the terms of any such extension or amendment) and
effective upon acceptance for payment of and payment for the Shares tendered
herewith, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the
order of, Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all the Shares that
are being tendered hereby (and any and all other Shares or other securities
issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after June 18, 2002 (collectively,
the "Distributions")) and appoints the Depositary the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to such Shares (and any
Distributions), with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being
deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to (i) deliver
certificates for such Shares (and any Distributions), or transfer ownership of
such Shares (and any Distributions) on the account books maintained by the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together, in any such case, with all accompanying
evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of Purchaser, (ii)
present such Shares (and any Distributions) for transfer on the books of the
Company and (iii) receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of
beneficial ownership of such Shares (and any Distributions), all in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Offer.

     The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints the designees of Purchaser and
each of them, as the attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, each with
full power of substitution, to exercise all voting and other rights of the
undersigned in such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his substitute
shall in his sole discretion deem proper, with respect to all of the Shares
tendered hereby which have been accepted for payment by Purchaser prior to the
time of any vote or other action (and any associated Distributions), at any
meeting of stockholders of the Company (whether annual or special and whether or
not an adjourned meeting), by written consent or otherwise. This proxy is
irrevocable and is granted in consideration of, and is effective upon, the
acceptance for payment of such Shares by Purchaser in accordance with the terms
of the Offer. Such acceptance for payment shall revoke any other proxy or
written consent granted by the undersigned at any time with respect to such
Shares (and any associated Distributions), and no subsequent proxies will be
given or written consents will be executed by the undersigned (and if given or
executed, will not be deemed to be effective).

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby (and any Distributions) and that when the same are accepted for
payment by Purchaser, Purchaser will acquire good and unencumbered title
thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances and
not subject to any adverse claims. The undersigned will, upon request, execute
and deliver any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or Purchaser to be
necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the
Shares tendered hereby (and any Distributions).

     All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors
and assigns of the undersigned. Except as stated in the Offer, this tender is
irrevocable.

     The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares pursuant to any one of
the procedures described in "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares" of the
Offer to Purchase and the instructions hereto will constitute the undersigned's
acceptance of the Offer and that Purchaser's acceptance for payment of the
Shares tendered will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and
Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. The
undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer
to Purchase, Purchaser may not be required to accept for payment any of the
Shares tendered hereby.

     Unless otherwise indicated under "Special Payment Instructions," please
issue the check for the purchase price of any Share Certificates purchased, and
return any Shares not tendered or not purchased, in the name(s) of the
undersigned (and, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer, by
credit to the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility). Similarly, unless
otherwise indicated under "Special Delivery Instructions," please mail the check
for the purchase price of any Share Certificates purchased and any certificates
for Shares not tendered or not purchased (and accompanying documents, as
appropriate) to the undersigned at the address shown below the undersigned's
signature(s). In the event that both "Special Payment Instructions" and "Special
Delivery Instructions" are completed, please issue the check for the purchase
price of any Share Certificates purchased and return any Shares not tendered or
not purchased in the name(s) of, and mail said check and any certificates to,
the person(s) so indicated. The undersigned recognizes that Purchaser has no
obligation, pursuant to the "Special Payment Instructions," to transfer any
Shares from the name of the registered holder(s) thereof if Purchaser does not
accept for payment any of the Shares so tendered.

                     FOR USE BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ONLY

       FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: PLACE MEDALLION GUARANTEE IN SPACE BELOW.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS

             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1.  Guarantee of Signatures.  Except as otherwise provided below, all
signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a financial
institution (including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage
houses) that is a member of a recognized Medallion Program approved by The
Securities Transfer Association, Inc. or any other "eligible guarantor
institution" (as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (each an "Eligible Institution"). Signatures
on this Letter of Transmittal need not be guaranteed (a) if this Letter of
Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares (which term, for
purposes of this document, shall include any participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner
of Shares) tendered herewith and such holder(s) have not completed the
instruction entitled "Special Payment Instructions" on this Letter of
Transmittal or (b) if such Shares are tendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution. See Instruction 5.

     2.  Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Shares.  This Letter of
Transmittal is to be used if Share Certificates are to be forwarded herewith or,
unless an Agent's Message is utilized, if deliveries are to be made by
book-entry transfer pursuant to the procedures set forth in "The
Offer -- Procedure for Tendering Shares" of the Offer to Purchase. Share
Certificates for all physically delivered Shares, or a confirmation of a
book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility of all Shares delivered electronically, as well as a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof)
and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, or an Agent's
Message in the case of a book-entry transfer, must be received by the Depositary
at one of its addresses set forth on the front page of this Letter of
Transmittal by the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase).

     Stockholders whose Share Certificates are not immediately available, who
cannot deliver their Share Certificates and all other required documents to the
Depositary prior to the Expiration Date or who cannot complete the procedure for
delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, may tender their Shares
pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedure described in Section 4 of the
Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to such procedure: (a) such tender must be made by
or through an Eligible Institution; (b) a properly completed and duly executed
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by Purchaser,
must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date; and (c) Share
Certificates for all tendered Shares, in proper form for tender, or a
confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility of all Shares delivered electronically, as well as
a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
signed facsimile thereof), and any other documents required by this Letter of
Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary within three Nasdaq National
Market trading days of the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery.

     The method of delivery of Shares and all other required documents is at the
option and risk of the tendering stockholder. If certificates for Shares are
sent by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured,
is recommended.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted, and no
fractional Shares will be purchased. By executing this Letter of Transmittal,
the tendering stockholder waives any right to receive any notice of the
acceptance for payment of the Shares.

     3.  Inadequate Space.  If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
Share Certificate numbers, the number of Shares evidenced by such Share
Certificates and the number of Shares tendered should be listed on a separate
signed schedule and attached hereto.

     4.  Partial Tenders (not applicable to stockholders who tender by
book-entry transfer).  If fewer than all the Shares represented by any
certificate delivered to the Depositary are to be tendered, fill in the number
of Shares which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered." In such case, a new certificate for the remainder of the Shares
represented by the old certificate will be sent to the

person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, unless otherwise provided in the
appropriate box on this Letter of Transmittal, as promptly as practicable
following the expiration or termination of the Offer. All Shares represented by
certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered
unless otherwise indicated.

     5.  Signatures on Letter of Transmittal; Stock Powers and Endorsements.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificates without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more
persons, all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are registered in different names on
different certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as
many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock powers
are required unless payment of the purchase price is to be made, or Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of any person other
than the registered holder(s). Signatures on any such certificates or stock
powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Shares tendered hereby, certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case, signed
exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the certificates
for such Shares. Signature(s) on any such certificates or stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed
by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to
Purchaser of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted.

     6.  Stock Transfer Taxes.  Purchaser will pay any stock transfer taxes with
respect to the sale and transfer of any Shares to it or its order pursuant to
the Offer. If, however, payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or
Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be returned in the name of, any
person other than the registered holder(s), or if a transfer tax is imposed for
any reason other than the sale or transfer of Shares to Purchaser pursuant to
the Offer, then the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s), such other person or otherwise) will be deducted from the
purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes, or
exemption therefrom, is submitted herewith.

     7.  Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.  If the check for the
purchase price of any Shares purchased is to be issued, or any Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned, in the name of a person other than
the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or if the check or any
certificates for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be mailed to
someone other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or to the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal at an address other than that shown
above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed.
Stockholders tendering Shares by book-entry transfer may request that Shares not
purchased be credited to such account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as
such stockholder may designate under "Special Payment Instructions." If no such
instructions are given, any such Shares not purchased will be returned by
crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above.

     8.  Substitute Form W-9.  Under the United States federal income tax laws,
the Depositary will be required to withhold a portion of the amount of any
payments made to certain stockholders pursuant to the Offer. In order to avoid
such backup withholding, each tendering stockholder, and, if applicable, each
other payee, must provide the Depositary with such stockholder's or payee's
correct taxpayer identification

number and certify that such stockholder or payee is not subject to such backup
withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9. In general, if a stockholder
or payee is an individual, the taxpayer identification number is the Social
Security number of such individual. If the Depositary is not provided with the
correct taxpayer identification number, the stockholder or payee may be subject
to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. For further
information concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing the
Substitute Form W-9 (including how to obtain a taxpayer identification number if
you do not have one and how to complete the Substitute Form W-9 if Shares are
held in more than one name), consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification
of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9.

     Certain stockholders or payees (including, among others, all corporations
and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order to satisfy the Depositary that a foreign
individual qualifies as an exempt recipient, such stockholder or payee must
submit a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that
individual's exempt status, on a properly completed appropriate version of Form
W-8, or successor form. Such statements can be obtained from the Depositary.

     Failure to complete the Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause
Shares to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may require the Depositary to
withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made pursuant to the Offer.
Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal
income tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will be reduced
by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of
taxes, a refund may be obtained provided that the required information is
furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN
THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 MAY RESULT IN BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF A PORTION OF ANY
PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE OFFER. PLEASE REVIEW THE ENCLOSED
GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE
FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

     9.  Mutilated, Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  Any holder of a
certificate(s) which represented Shares whose certificate(s) has been mutilated,
lost, stolen, or destroyed should (i) complete this Letter of Transmittal and
check the appropriate box above and (ii) contact EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.
immediately at 781-575-3400. EquiServe will provide such holder with all
necessary forms and instructions to replace any mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates. The holder may also be required to give the Company a
bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
the certificate(s) alleged to have been mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed.
However, there can be no assurances that such mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates will be replaced prior to the expiration date of the
Offer.

     10.  Waiver of Conditions.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, the conditions of the Offer may be waived, in whole or in
part, by Purchaser, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time,
in the case of any shares tendered.

     11.  Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.  Requests for assistance
or additional copies of the Offer to Purchase and this Letter of Transmittal may
be obtained from the Information Agent at its address or telephone number set
forth on the back cover of this Letter of Transmittal.

     IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE
HEREOF) OR AN AGENT'S MESSAGE TOGETHER WITH SHARE CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION
OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, OR THE NOTICE OF
GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION
DATE.

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are
accepted for purchase is required by law to provide the Depositary with such
stockholder's correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on Substitute Form
W-9 below and to certify that such TIN is correct (or that such stockholder is
awaiting a TIN) or otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup
withholding. If such stockholder is an individual, the TIN is his or her social
security number. If a stockholder fails to provide a correct TIN to the
Depositary, such stockholder may be subject to a $50.00 penalty imposed by the
Internal Revenue Service. In addition, payments that are made to such
stockholder with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be
subject to backup withholding of 30 percent. In addition, if a stockholder makes
a false statement that results in no imposition of backup withholding and there
was no reasonable basis for making such statement, a $500.00 penalty may also be
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, that stockholder must generally submit an appropriate Form W-8,
signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status.
An appropriate Form W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed
"Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9" for additional instructions. A stockholder should consult his or her
tax advisor as to such stockholder's qualification for exemption from backup
withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 30
percent of any payments made to the stockholder or payee. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the Internal Revenue Service.

PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments made to a stockholder whose
tendered Shares are accepted for purchase (other than foreign persons who
provide an appropriate Form W-8), the stockholder should complete and sign the
Substitute Form W-9 included in this Letter of Transmittal and is required to
provide the stockholder's correct TIN to the Depositary and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided on such Form is correct (or that
such stockholder is awaiting a TIN) and that (i) such stockholder is exempt from
backup withholding; (ii) such stockholder has not been notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that such stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a
result of failure to report all interest or dividends; or (iii) the Internal
Revenue Service has notified the stockholder that the stockholder is no longer
subject to backup withholding. The stockholder must sign and date the Substitute
Form W-9 where indicated, certifying that the information on such Form is
correct.

WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the social security
number or employer identification number of the record owner of the Shares
tendered hereby. If the Shares are in more than one name or are not in the name
of the actual owner, consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of
Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidance on
which number to report. If backup withholding applies and "Applied for" is
written in Part I of the Substitute Form W-9 and the Stockholder has completed
the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number, the Depositary will
retain 30 percent of any payment of the purchase price for tendered Shares
during the 60-day period following the date of the Substitute Form W-9. If a
stockholder's TIN is provided to the Depositary within 60 days of the date of
the Substitute Form W-9, payment of such retained amounts will be made to such
stockholder. If a stockholder's TIN is not provided to the Depositary within
such 60-day period, the Depositary will remit such retained amounts to the
Internal Revenue Service as backup withholding and shall withhold 30 percent of
any payment of the purchase price for the tendered Shares made to such
stockholder thereafter unless such stockholder furnishes a TIN to the Depositary
prior to such payment.

                                         (1) The number shown on this form is my correct Taxpayer Identification
                                         Number (or, as indicated, I am waiting for a number to be issued to me);
                                             and
                                         (2) I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from
                                         backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal
                                             Revenue Service (the "IRS") that I am subject to backup withholding as
                                             a result of a failure to report all interests or dividends, or (c) the
                                             IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding.
                                         Certification Instructions -- You must cross out item (2) above if you
                                         have been notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding
                                         because of underreporting of interest or dividends on your tax return.
                                         However, if after being notified by the IRS that you were subject to
                                         backup withholding you received another notification from the IRS that you
                                         are no longer subject to backup withholding, do not cross out item (2).

pursuant to the Offer, subject to Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

To Our Clients:

     Enclosed for your consideration is an Offer to Purchase dated June 18, 2002

purchase price of $9.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase
and the Letter of Transmittal.

     We are the holder of record of Shares held for your account. A tender of
such Shares can be made only by us as the holder of record and pursuant to your
instructions. The Letter of Transmittal is furnished to you for your information
only and cannot be used by you to tender Shares held by us for your account.

     We request instructions as to whether you wish us to tender any or all of
the Shares held by us for your account, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal.

     Your attention is invited to the following:

          1.  The tender price is $9.00 per Share, net to you in cash.

          2.  The Offer is being made for all of the outstanding Shares.

          3.  The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being
     validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
     expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of Shares that,
     together with the Shares then owned by Novell and/or Purchaser or any
     subsidiary of Novell, represents at least a majority of the Shares
     outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and (2) the expiration or termination
     of any and all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws. The Offer
     is also subject to certain other conditions described in Section 16 of the
     Offer to Purchase. The Offer is not conditioned upon Novell obtaining
     financing.

          4.  The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
     Merger, dated as of June 9, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the
     Company, Novell and Purchaser. The Merger Agreement provides for, among
     other things, the making of the Offer by Purchaser, and further provides
     that, as soon as practicable following consummation of the Offer and
     satisfaction of certain conditions, Purchaser will be merged with and into
     the Company (the "Merger") with the Company continuing as the surviving
     corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell.

          5.  The Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
     held on June 9, 2002, has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger
     Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer
     and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
     stockholders, (2) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and Novell's
     acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Stockholder's Agreements among
     Novell, Purchaser and certain stockholders of the Company in accordance
     with the Delaware General Corporation Law and (3) recommended that the
     Company's stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares in the Offer
     and adopt the Merger Agreement.

          6.  THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS EXPIRE AT 9:00 A.M., NEW YORK CITY
     TIME, ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 17, 2002, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

          7.  Any stock transfer taxes applicable to a sale of Shares to the
     Purchaser will be borne by Purchaser, except as otherwise provided in
     Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

     If you wish to have us tender any or all of your Shares, please so instruct
us by completing, executing, detaching and returning to us the instruction form
on the detachable part hereof. An envelope to return your instructions to us is
enclosed. If you authorize the tender of your Shares, all such Shares will be
tendered unless otherwise specified on the detachable part hereof. Your
instructions should be forwarded to us in ample time to permit us to submit a
tender on your behalf by the expiration of the Offer.

     The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from or on
behalf of, holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the
Offer or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such
jurisdiction.

     Payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will in all cases be
made only after timely receipt by Mellon Investor Services LLC (the
"Depositary") of (a) certificates representing the Shares tendered or timely
confirmation of the book-entry transfer of such Shares into the account
maintained by the Depositary at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry
Transfer Facility"), pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4 of the
Offer to Purchase, (b) the Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's Message (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase), in connection with a book-entry delivery, and
(c) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. Accordingly,
payment may not be made to all tendering stockholders at the same time depending
upon when certificates for or confirmations of book-entry transfer of such
Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility are

affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

                                       OF
                           SILVERSTREAM SOFTWARE, INC.
                                       AT
                               $9.00 NET PER SHARE
                                       BY
                              DELAWARE PLANET INC.,
                          A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
                                  NOVELL, INC.

         Delaware Planet Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Novell"), is
offering to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share (the "Shares"), of SilverStream Software, Inc., a Delaware corpo-
ration (the "Company"), at a price of $9.00 per Share, net to the seller in
cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Offer to Purchase, dated June 18, 2002 (the "Offer to Purchase") and in
the related Letter of Transmittal (which, as each may be amended and
supplemented from time to time, together constitute the "Offer"). The purpose of
the Offer is for Purchaser to acquire a majority voting interest in the Company
as the first step in Novell acquiring the entire equity interest in the Company.
Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser intends to effect the Merger
described below.

THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 9:00 A.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON
WEDNESDAY, JULY 17, 2002 (THE "EXPIRATION DATE"), UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE OFFER, PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF
THE OFFER AND NOT WITHDRAWN, A NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES
THEN OWNED BY NOVELL AND/OR PURCHASER OR ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY OF NOVELL,
REPRESENTS AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OUTSTANDING ON A FULLY-DILUTED
BASIS (THE "MINIMUM CONDITION"), AND (2) THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF ANY
AND ALL WAITING PERIODS UNDER APPLICABLE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE OFFER IS ALSO
SUBJECT TO OTHER CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE. THE OFFER IS NOT
CONDITIONED UPON NOVELL OBTAINING FINANCING.

         The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of June 9, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Novell and
Purchaser. The Merger Agreement provides that, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer and satisfaction of the conditions of the Merger,
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at
the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Novell, the
Company or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, all of which will
be cancelled, and Shares held by the Company's stockholders, if any, who
properly exercise their appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation
Law) will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 per Share in cash or any
higher per Share price paid in the Offer, net without interest.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, AT A MEETING DULY CALLED AND
HELD ON JUNE 9, 2002, HAS UNANIMOUSLY (1) DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER,
ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS, (2)
APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY,
INCLUDING THE OFFER, THE MERGER AND NOVELL'S ACQUISITION OF SHARES PURSUANT TO
THE STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENTS (AS DEFINED BELOW), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DELAWARE
GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, AND (3) RECOMMENDED TO THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS THAT
THEY ACCEPT THE OFFER, TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE OFFER AND ADOPT THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

         In order to induce Novell and Purchaser to enter into the Merger
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, consisting of all of the
Company's directors and certain affiliates of the directors and certain of the
Company's executive officers owning in the aggregate approximately 20% of the
issued and outstanding Shares (or approximately 16% of the Shares on a
fully-diluted basis), have entered into Stockholder's Agreements, each dated as
of June 9, 2002 (each a "Stockholder's Agreement"), with Novell and Purchaser
pursuant to which such stockholders have, subject to certain limitations, (i)
agreed to tender and sell 4,611,413 Shares (the "Subject Shares") to Novell
pursuant to the Offer, (ii) agreed not to withdraw any Subject Shares tendered
in the Offer, (iii) agreed to vote such Subject Shares in favor of the Merger
and the Merger Agreement and against any acquisition proposal other than the
Merger, (iv) granted to Novell an option to purchase the Subject Shares under
certain conditions and (v) granted to Novell, Purchaser and their nominees an
irrevocable proxy to vote such Subject Shares in favor of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

         For purposes of the Offer, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted
for payment tendered Shares when, as and if Purchaser gives oral or written
notice of its acceptance to Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "Depositary").
Purchaser will pay for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer by
depositing the purchase price with the Depositary. The Depositary will act as
agent for all tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from
Purchaser and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders whose Shares
have been accepted for payment. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID ON
THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN
MAKING SUCH PAYMENT. In all cases, payment for Shares tendered and accepted
for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
Depositary of (1) certificates for such Shares or timely confirmation of a
book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, (2) a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (or an Agent's Message in connection with a book-entry
transfer of Shares) and (3) any other required documents. Accordingly, payment
may be made to tendering stockholders at different times if delivery of the
Shares and other required documents occurs at different times.

         Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser reserves the
right to extend the Expiration Date, in its reasonable discretion, if at any
Expiration Date, any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or
waived. In addition, if the Offer has not been consummated at the Expiration
Date due to the failure to satisfy the condition to the Offer relating to the
expiration of the waiting period under any applicable antitrust laws, Purchaser
will, at the request of the Company, extend the Expiration Date for one or more
periods (not in excess of ten business days each) but in no event later than
December 31, 2002. Any extension will be followed as promptly as practicable by
public announcement to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. Subject to
the terms of the Offer and the Merger Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver
of all the conditions to the Offer as of any Expiration Date, Purchaser will
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after such Expiration
Date.

         Tendering stockholders who are record owners of their Shares and tender
directly to the Depositary will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions or, except as otherwise provided in Instruction 6 of the Letter of
Transmittal, transfer taxes on the sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Stockholders who hold their Shares through a broker or other nominee should
consult such institution as to whether it charges any service fees for tendering
of Shares in the Offer on behalf of a Stockholder. Purchaser will pay all
charges and expenses of the Dealer Manager, the Depositary and the Information
Agent incurred in connection with the Offer.

         Purchaser does not currently intend to include a subsequent offering
period in the Offer, although it reserves the right to do so in its sole
discretion. Under Exchange Act Rule 14d-7, no withdrawal rights apply to Shares
tendered during a subsequent offering period and no withdrawal rights apply
during the subsequent offering period with respect to Shares tendered in the
Offer and accepted for payment. Purchaser will pay the same consideration to all
stockholders tendering Shares in the Offer or in a subsequent offering period,
if it includes one.

         Tendering stockholders may withdraw tenders of Shares made pursuant to
the Offer at any time prior to the Expiration Date. Thereafter, such tenders
are irrevocable, except that they may be withdrawn after August 16, 2002 unless
such Shares are accepted for payment as provided for in the Offer to Purchase.
If Purchaser extends the period of time during which the Offer is open, is
delayed in accepting for payment or paying for Shares pursuant to the Offer for
any reason, or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for
any reason, then, without prejudice to Purchaser's rights under the Offer, the
Depositary may, on Purchaser's behalf, retain all Shares tendered, and such
Shares may not be withdrawn except as otherwise provided in the Offer to
Purchase.

         To withdraw tendered Shares, a written or facsimile transmission notice
of withdrawal with respect to the Shares must be timely received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the Offer to
Purchase, and the notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who
tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and
the name of the registered holder of Shares, if different from that of the
person who tendered such Shares. If the Shares to be withdrawn have been
delivered to the Depositary, a signed notice of withdrawal with (except in the
case of Shares tendered by an Eligible Institution) signatures guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution must be submitted prior to the release of such Shares. In
addition, such notice must specify, in the case of Shares tendered by delivery
of certificates, the name of the registered holder (if different from that of
the tendering stockholder) and the serial numbers shown on the particular
certificates evidencing the Shares to be withdrawn or, in the case of Shares
tendered by book-entry transfer, the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares.
Withdrawals may not be rescinded, and Shares withdrawn will thereafter be deemed
not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be
re-tendered by again following one of the procedures described in Section 4 of
the Offer to Purchase at any time prior to the Expiration Date.

         Purchaser will determine, in its discretion, all questions as to the
form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal, and
its determination shall be final and binding. None of Novell, Purchaser, the
Dealer Manager, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will
be under any duty to give notification of any defect or irregularity in any
notice of withdrawal or waiver of any such defect or irregularity or incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification.

         The Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's stockholder list
and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to
holders of Shares. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and
other related materials are being mailed to record holders of Shares and will be
furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar
persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder
list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's
security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of
Shares.

         The information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule
14d-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is contained in the
Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

         THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND SHOULD BE READ IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE ANY DECISION
IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

         Questions and requests for assistance or for copies of the Offer to
Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal, and other Offer materials, may
be directed to the Information Agent as set forth below, and copies will be
furnished promptly at Purchaser's expense. No fees or commissions will be paid

                             STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENT

         STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENT, dated as of June __, 2002 (the "AGREEMENT"),
among Novell, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Delaware Planet Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER
SUBSIDIARY"), and the Stockholder of SilverStream Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "COMPANY"), whose name appears on Schedule I hereto (the
"STOCKHOLDER").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be
amended from time to time, the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), which provides for, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) the commencement by
Merger Subsidiary of a tender offer (the "OFFER") for all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company
(the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), and (ii) the subsequent merger of Merger
Subsidiary with and into the Company (the "MERGER");

         WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder owns (beneficially (as
determined herein pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act")) and of record) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock set forth opposite the Stockholder's name on Schedule I hereto (all such
shares so owned and which may hereafter be acquired by the Stockholder prior to
the termination of this Agreement, whether upon the exercise of options or by
means of purchase, dividend, distribution or otherwise, but excluding any shares
issuable pursuant to any option exercise unless and until such shares are
actually issued, being referred to herein as the Stockholder's "SHARES");

         WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have required that the Stockholder enter
into this Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Merger Subsidiary to enter into
the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Stockholder hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

                        Transfer and Voting of Shares and
                       Other Covenants of the Stockholder

         Section 1.01 Voting of Shares. From the date hereof until the earliest
to occur of (x) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01 hereof,
(y) the expiration of the Stock Option (as defined below) with respect to the
Stockholder's Shares and (z) the closing of any exercise of such Stock Option
(the "TERM"), at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called,
and in any action by consent of the stockholders of the Company, the Stockholder
shall vote its Shares (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii)
against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and
against any proposal for action or agreement that would result in a breach of
any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or which is reasonably likely to result
in any of the conditions of the Company's obligations under the Merger Agreement
not being fulfilled, any change in the directors of the Company,

any change in the present capitalization of the Company or any amendment to the
Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Second
Amended and Restated Bylaws, any other material change in the Company's
corporate structure or business or any other action which in the case of each of
the matters referred to in this clause (ii) could reasonably be expected to
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or materially adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the likelihood of such
transactions being consummated and (iii) in favor of any other matter necessary
for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that
is considered at any such meeting of stockholders or in such consent, and in
connection therewith to execute any documents which are necessary or appropriate
in order to effectuate the foregoing, including the ability for Merger
Subsidiary or its nominees to vote such Shares directly.

         Section 1.02 No Inconsistent Arrangements. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall not during the
Term (i) transfer (which term shall include, without limitation, any sale,
assignment, gift, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition), or consent to any
transfer of, any or all of the Stockholder's Shares or any interest therein, or
create or permit to exist any Encumbrance (as defined below) on such Shares,
(ii) enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding with
respect to any transfer of any or all of such Shares or any interest therein,
(iii) grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization in or with
respect to such Shares, (iv) deposit such Shares into a voting trust or enter
into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such Shares or (v) take
any other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of its obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall prohibit any sale, transfer or assignment of Shares by a Stockholder to
members of such Stockholder's family, a family trust of such Stockholder or a
charitable institution if the transferee of such Shares agrees in writing to be
bound by the terms hereof and notice of such sale, transfer or assignment,
including the name and address of the purchaser, transferee or assignee, is
delivered to Merger Subsidiary.

         Section 1.03 Proxy/Power of Attorney. The Stockholder hereby revokes
any and all prior proxies or powers of attorney in respect of any of the
Stockholder's Shares and constitutes and appoints Merger Subsidiary and Parent,
or any nominee of Merger Subsidiary and Parent, with full power of substitution
and resubstitution, at any time during the Term, as its true and lawful attorney
and proxy (its "PROXY"), for and in its name, place and stead, to vote each of
such Shares as its Proxy, at every annual, special, adjourned or postponed
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, including the right to sign its name
(as stockholder) to any consent, certificate or other document relating to the
Company and any matter referred to in Section 1.01 above that Delaware law may
permit or require.

         THE FOREGOING PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY ARE IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED
WITH AN INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE TERM.

         Section 1.04 Waiver of Appraisal Rights. The Stockholder hereby waives
any rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger.

         Section 1.05 Stop Transfer. The Stockholder shall not request that the
Company register the transfer (book-entry or otherwise) of any certificate or
uncertificated interest representing any of the Stockholder's Shares, unless
such transfer is made in compliance with this Agreement (including the
provisions of Article 3 hereof).

         Section 1.06 No Solicitation. During the Term, the Stockholder shall
not, and it shall cause its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives (collectively, the "REPRESENTATIVES") not to, (i) solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect thereto, (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with,

furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any
third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall, and it shall
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing.

         To the same extent required by the Company pursuant to, and subject to
the same conditions contained in, the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall
notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by
the Stockholder of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that any third party
is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any third party that may be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. To the same extent required by the Company pursuant to,
and subject to the same conditions contained in, the Merger Agreement, the
Stockholder shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify
the third party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
1.06 to the contrary, if the Stockholder or any of its Representatives is a
member of the Company's Board of Directors, such member of the Company's Board
of Directors may take actions in such capacity to the extent permitted by
Section 7.04 of the Merger Agreement.

         Section 1.07 Stockholder Capacity; Fiduciary Duties. No Stockholder
executing this Agreement who is or becomes during the term hereof a director or
officer of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company makes any agreement or
understanding herein or is obligated hereunder in his or her capacity as such
director or officer. The Stockholder signs solely in such Stockholder's capacity
as the record holder and beneficial owner (as further set forth on Schedule I
hereto) of the Stockholder's Shares. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to prohibit a Stockholder who is a member of the Board of Directors of
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or officer of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company from taking any action or inaction solely in such
capacity or from taking any action or inaction with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise, as a member of, or at the direction of, the Board of
Directors of the Company to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                Tender of Shares

         Section 2.01 Tender. The Stockholder shall validly tender (or cause the
record owner of such shares to validly tender) the Stockholder's Shares pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer, not later than the fifth
business day after commencement of the Offer pursuant to Section 2.01 of the
Merger Agreement and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, and not thereafter
withdraw such tender during the Term. The Stockholder hereby acknowledges and
agrees that Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's obligation to accept for payment
and pay for the Stockholder's Shares in the Offer is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer. For all its Shares validly tendered in the Offer and
not withdrawn, the Stockholder will be entitled to receive the highest price
paid by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Offer. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate any Stockholder to exercise any option, warrant or other right to
purchase shares of capital stock of the Company.

         Section 2.02 Certain Warranties. Without limiting the generality or
effect of any other term or condition of the Offer, the transfer by the
Stockholder of the Shares to Merger Subsidiary in the Offer

shall pass to and unconditionally vest in Merger Subsidiary good and valid title
to the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances whatsoever other than
restrictions under applicable securities laws.

         Section 2.03 Disclosure. The Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to publish and disclose in the Offer Documents (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) and, if approval of the Company's stockholders is required
under applicable law, the Proxy Statement (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(including all documents and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission), its identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                                     Option

         Section 3.01 Option Shares.

                  (a) In order to induce Parent and Merger Subsidiary to enter
into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder hereby grants to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, as Parent may designate (the "OPTIONEE"), an irrevocable option
(each such option, a "STOCK OPTION") to purchase all, but not in any part or
less than all, of the Stockholder's Shares (in such context, the "OPTION
SHARES") at a purchase price per share equal to [deal price] (the "EXERCISE
PRICE"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

                  (b) The Stock Option may be exercised by the Optionee in whole
or from time to time in part, at any time following the occurrence of a
Triggering Event (as defined below) and prior to the termination of the Stock
Option in accordance with Section 6.01. In the event the Optionee wishes to
exercise the Stock Option, the Optionee shall send an irrevocable written notice
to the Stockholder (the "Stock Exercise Notice") specifying the total number of
Option Shares it wishes to purchase and a date (not later than 10 business days
and not earlier than three business days from the date such notice is given;
provided, however, that if Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act is applicable at
the time of exercise of the Stock Option, the period in this clause shall not
begin before the expiration or termination of the tender offer and shall extend
for 10 business days after the expiration or termination of the tender offer)
for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"). In the event of any
change in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock by
reason of any stock dividend, stock split, split-up, recapitalization, merger or
other similar change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company, the
number of Option Shares subject to the Stock Option and the Exercise Price per
Option Share shall be proportionally adjusted.

                  (c) The Optionee's right to exercise the Stock Option is
subject to the following conditions:

                           (i) neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall have
breached any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement such that the breach
was the primary cause or resulted in the failure of the Offer to be consummated;

                           (ii) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order issued by any federal, state or foreign court of competent jurisdiction
invalidating the grant or prohibiting the exercise of the Stock Option or the
delivery of the Option Shares shall be in effect;

                           (iii) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and any applicable foreign antitrust
law or regulation shall have expired or been terminated; and

                           (iv) a Triggering Event shall have occurred.

A "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to have occurred if the Merger Agreement
shall have been terminated pursuant to (x) Section 11.01(b)(iii), 11.01(c) or
11.01(d) thereof, (y) Section 11.01(b)(i) thereof, provided that an Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have been made after the
date hereof and prior to such termination (which shall not have been withdrawn
in good faith prior to such termination) or (z) Section 11.01(e)(i) thereof,
except that such termination shall not be deemed a Triggering Event if the
breach causing such termination occurred through no fault of the Company and as
a result of events occurring after the date hereof.

                  (d) The Optionee's obligation to purchase the Option Shares
following the exercise of the Stock Option, and the Stockholder's obligation to
deliver the Option Shares, are subject to the conditions that:

                           (i) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order issued by any foreign, federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
prohibiting the delivery of the Option Shares shall be in effect;

                           (ii) the purchase of the Option Shares will not
violate any material law, rule or regulation; and

                           (iii) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and any applicable foreign antitrust
law or regulation shall have expired or been terminated.

                  (e) At any Closing Date, the Stockholder will deliver to the
Optionee a certificate or certificates for any shares that are certificated
representing the Option Shares in the denominations designated by the Optionee
in its Stock Exercise Notice, and the Optionee will purchase the Option Shares
from the Stockholder at a price per Option Share equal to the Exercise Price,
payable in cash. Payment made by the Optionee to the Stockholder pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer of federal funds to a bank
designated by the Stockholder. After payment of the Exercise Price for the
Option Shares covered by the Stock Exercise Notice, the Stock Option shall be
deemed exercised to the extent of the Option Shares specified in the Stock
Exercise Notice as of the date such Stock Exercise Notice is given to the
Stockholder. Upon the delivery of certificates as described herein, good and
valid title to the Option Shares shall pass to and unconditionally vest in the
Optionee, free and clear of all Encumbrances whatsoever, other than restrictions
imposed by securities laws.

                  (f) Any closing hereunder shall take place on the Closing Date
specified by the Optionee in its Stock Exercise Notice or the first business day
thereafter on which all of the conditions in Section 3.01(c) and (d) are met, at
the principal executive office of the Company, or at such other time and place
as the parties hereto may agree.

                                   ARTICLE 4

                Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder

         The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary as follows:

         Section 4.01 Due Authorization, etc. The Stockholder has all requisite
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, to appoint
Merger Subsidiary and Parent as its Proxy and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
the appointment of Merger Subsidiary and Parent as the Stockholder's Proxy and
the

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Stockholder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the
Stockholder and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms.
There is no beneficiary or holder of a voting trust certificate or other
interest of any trust of which the Stockholder is trustee whose consent is
required for the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by
the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 4.02 No Conflicts; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Stockholder does not, and, subject to compliance with applicable antitrust and
securities laws, the performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will not,
(i) conflict with or violate any trust agreement or other similar documents
relating to any trust of which the Stockholder is trustee, (ii) conflict with or
violate any law applicable to the Stockholder or by which the Stockholder or any
of the Stockholder's properties are bound or affected or (iii) result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
lien or encumbrance on any assets of the Stockholder, including, without
limitation, the Stockholder's Shares, pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the
Stockholder or any of the Stockholder's assets is bound or affected, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such breaches, defaults or other
occurrences that would not prevent or delay the performance by the Stockholder
of the Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b) Subject to compliance with applicable antitrust and
securities laws, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will not,
require the Stockholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing by the Stockholder with or notification by the Stockholder to, any
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, except where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to

OFFER LETTER AMONG NOVELL AND DAVID LITWACK

                                                                  Exhibit (d)(4)

June 5, 2002

Mr. David Litwack
President and Chief Executive Officer
SilverStream Software, Inc.
Two Federal Street
Billerica, MA  01821-3559

Dear David:

As you know, Novell, Inc. is currently negotiating with SilverStream Software,
Inc. to enter into a merger agreement with SilverStream and Novell Subsidiary, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell ("Novell Subsidiary") (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Novell Subsidiary will make a cash tender offer
to acquire all of the outstanding stock of SilverStream (the "Offer"). After
consummation of the Offer, Novell Subsidiary will be merged with and into
SilverStream, with SilverStream becoming the surviving corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Novell (the "Merger").

The purpose of this letter agreement is to (i) confirm the terms of your
continued employment with SilverStream after consummation of the Merger, (ii)
confirm your reaffirmation of the terms of SilverStream's Standard Employee
Agreement, as set forth on Exhibit A (the "SilverStream Agreement"), or, if you
have not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, your agreement to the
terms of the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as further modified by this
letter, and (iii) confirm your agreement to waive your rights to accelerated
vesting and exercisability under the terms of any of your stock option
agreements and any amendment to your outstanding stock option agreements;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not become effective if the Merger
is not consummated. More specifically, in consideration of the position and
benefits outlined in this letter, to induce Novell to enter into the Merger
Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, by signing this letter, you agree (i) to the reaffirmation of the
SilverStream Agreement, or, in the event you have not previously executed the
SilverStream Agreement, to execute the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as
further modified by this letter, and (ii) that immediately prior to execution of
the Merger Agreement by Novell, your rights to the accelerated vesting and
exercisability of your stock options, as set forth in your stock option
agreements, any amendment to your

stock option agreements or otherwise, will be of no further force and effect;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not become effective if the Merger
is not consummated. You will have the following title and be eligible for the
following benefits after the Merger:

     -    After the consummation of the Merger, you will be employed by
          SilverStream in the position of Senior Vice President, Web Services &
          Development Platform with a rate of pay equal to $14,583.33
          semi-monthly (less applicable withholding), which is $350,000
          annualized (less applicable withholding), payable in accordance with
          SilverStream's payroll practices. Such rate of pay is exclusive of
          bonuses, commissions and other incentive pay you may receive during
          your employment. In this position, you will report to Chris Stone.

     -    In addition to your base salary, you will be eligible to participate
          in the Novell Executive Incentive Plan (the "Executive Plan") after
          consummation of the Merger. To participate in the Executive Plan, you
          must be employed for the entire fiscal year. The actual incentive
          amount will be based on a number of factors, including company, team
          and individual performance. Any incentive that may be awarded is
          within the sole discretion of Novell. Your annualized target bonus
          under the Executive Incentive Plan will initially represent 60% of
          your base salary.

     -    After consummation of the Merger, subject to approval by Novell's
          Board of Directors, you will be granted a nonqualified stock option to
          purchase 200,000 shares of Novell common stock at an exercise price
          equal to the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the
          applicable Novell stock option plan) of the stock on the date of
          grant. Your stock option will vest and become exercisable according to
          the following schedule:

          Options vest and become exercisable over a 4 year period; with 25%
          vesting and becoming exercisable one year from the date of grant and
          monthly vesting thereafter.

     -    Your outstanding SilverStream stock options, whether or not vested or
          exercisable as of the date of the consummation of the Merger, will be
          assumed by Novell and converted into stock options to acquire Novell
          stock (subject to the Merger's exchange ratio, as will be set forth in
          the Merger Agreement), with continued vesting and exercisability in
          such options on the vesting and exercisability schedule effective
          immediately prior to their assumption and not subject to any
          accelerated vesting and exercisability as a result of the consummation
          of the Merger

     -    After consummation of the Merger, subject to approval by Novell's
          Board of Directors, you will be granted the right to purchase 200,000
          shares of Novell

          restricted stock (consistent with the terms of the applicable Novell
          restricted stock plan), which will be subject to forfeiture or a
          repurchase right in favor of Novell if you terminate employment prior
          to the lapse of restrictions on the shares. The restricted stock will
          vest according to the following vesting schedule, if you are employed
          by SilverStream on the applicable date:

          -    100% cliff vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant

     -    You will become a participant in the Novell Senior Management
          Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") after consummation of the
          Merger, subject to approval by Novell's Board of Directors. The
          Severance Plan provides severance protection to you both for a
          termination outside of the context of a change of control and for a
          termination following a change of control. Your severance payment, as
          described under Article IV A.1. of the Severance Plan, will be 18
          months of your then current base salary. With respect to your
          non-compete and non-solicitation covenant, as described in Article VII
          A. and B. of the Severance Plan respectively, the period associated
          with each is two years from your termination of employment. The
          Severance Plan is subject to modification or termination in accordance
          with its terms.

     -    Novell intends to continue SilverStream's current employee benefits
          programs after the Merger through the end of 2002, and, thereafter,
          you will become eligible to participate in Novell's employee benefits
          programs at the same levels and with the same benefits as other
          similarly-situated Novell employees. These programs include, but are
          not limited to, medical, dental, life insurance, disability benefits,
          401(k) plan, paid holidays, and flexible time off.

     -    As a condition to receiving the title and benefits described above in
          connection with your continued employment with SilverStream after
          consummation of the Merger, you must reaffirm your acceptance to the
          terms of the SilverStream Agreement in its entirety, or, if you have
          not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, you agree to
          execute the SilverStream Agreement, except that in either case, the
          SilverStream Agreement shall be amended to provide that (i) the
          non-solicitation and non-competition periods in Section 3 thereof
          shall continue for a period of two years after your termination or
          cessation of employment for any reason, (ii) the term "Company" shall
          be amended to mean the Company and all of its subsidiary and
          affiliated companies as they may exist from time to time, whether or
          not you are employed by any such subsidiary or affiliated companies,
          (iii) the second sentence of Section 6(d) shall be deleted, and (iv)
          the term "Development" shall be amended to include intellectual
          property owned by you, or in which you have an interest, that is or
          has been incorporated in a Company product, service, process, software
          or other property. In addition, after consummation of the Merger, you
          will be required to execute Novell's

          Code of Business Ethics, which is required for all employees of Novell
          and its subsidiaries.

If you accept this offer of continued employment, you acknowledge and agree that
the rights and obligations under this letter and its attached Exhibit shall
survive the termination of your employment with SilverStream or Novell for any
reason and shall be binding upon your heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives. This letter, upon its acceptance by you, is binding on
SilverStream's or Novell's successors and assigns, and all covenants in this
letter shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or
assigns.

The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this letter shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, without reference to conflicts of laws principles. In addition,
you agree that any dispute, claim or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this letter shall be commenced and maintained in any state or federal court in
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and you submit to the exclusive venue and
jurisdiction of such court. The language of all parts of this letter shall be
construed as a whole according to its fair meaning and shall not be construed
strictly either for or against either party. Moreover, the terms "and" and "or"
shall both mean "and/or."

You acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this agreement describing
the terms of your continued employment with SilverStream after the consummation
of the Merger, including, but not limited to the restricted stock and stock
option grant, is sufficient consideration for your reaffirmation of the terms of
the SilverStream Agreement, or, in the event you have not previously executed
the SilverStream Agreement, your execution of the SilverStream Agreement, in
either case as further modified by this letter, and the waiver of your rights
under your stock option agreements and any amendment to your stock option
agreements that provides for acceleration of vesting and exercisability with
respect to such stock options. You agree that the restrictions in this letter
are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Novell and you
consider them to be reasonable for such purpose.

You also acknowledge and agree that upon your acceptance of this offer of
continued employment that any breach or threatened breach of any provision of
this letter will cause Novell substantial and irrevocable damage and monetary
damages would be inadequate to compensate Novell and, in addition to any other
remedies or rights it may have, Novell shall be entitled to seek an injunction
and all other available equitable relief to enforce the terms of this letter.

You further acknowledge and agree that the provisions in this letter are
necessary to protect Novell's interests and are reasonable under the
circumstances, given that Novell conducts business worldwide and that a
competitive business may be carried out anywhere in the world as a result of
advanced communications technology. Each provision herein shall be treated as a
separate and independent clause, and the

unenforceability of any of the other clauses shall in no way impair the
enforceability of any of the other clauses of this letter. If any provision of
this letter shall be for any reason held to be excessively broad as to length of
time, scope, range of activities, geographic area or otherwise so as to be
unenforceable at law, such provision(s) shall be reformed and construed by the
appropriate judicial body to the fullest extent enforceable, and the remaining
provisions of this letter will not be affected.

Please signify acceptance of this offer of continued employment with
SilverStream, as well as your reaffirmation of the SilverStream Agreement, or,
in the event you have not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, you
execute the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as further modified by this
letter, and your waiver of any provision under your stock option agreements and
any amendment to your stock option agreements that provides for the accelerated
vesting and exercisability on your outstanding SilverStream stock options as a
result of the Merger, by signing the "Acceptance and Acknowledgment" attached to
this letter. You must return an executed copy of this letter agreement and an

Sincerely,

/s/ Alan J. Friedman

                                    EXHIBIT A

                    SILVERSTREAM STANDARD EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

                    SILVERSTREAM STANDARD EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

This agreement is made between SilverStream Software Inc. (the "Company"), and
__________________________________________ (the "Employee").

In consideration of the employment or the continued employment of the Employee
by the Company, the Company and the Employee agree as follows:

1.   PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

a) The Employee agrees that all information, whether or not in writing, of a
   private, secret or confidential nature concerning the Company's business,
   business relationships or financial affairs (collectively, "Proprietary
   Information") is and will continue to be the exclusive property of the
   Company. In order to illustrate this definition, Proprietary Information may
   include, without limitation, inventions, products, processes, methods,
   techniques, formulas, compositions, compounds, projects, developments, plans,
   research data, clinical data, financial data, personnel data, computer
   programs, customer and supplier lists, and contact at or knowledge of
   customers or prospective customers of the Company, as well as materials and
   tangible property of customers of the Company or suppliers to the Company.
   The Employee will not communicate any Proprietary Information to any person
   or entity other than employees of the Company or use Proprietary Information
   for any purpose (other than in the performance of his/her duties as an
   employee of the Company) without written approval by an officer of the
   Company, either during or after his/her employment with the Company, unless
   and until such Proprietary Information has become public knowledge without
   activity by the Employee.

b) The Employee agrees to return promptly to the Company, upon (i) a request by
   the Company or (ii) termination of his/her employment, whichever is earlier,
   all Proprietary Information and all tangible property furnished to or
   prepared by the Employee in the course of or relating to his/her employment.
   After such delivery, the Employee shall not keep any Proprietary Information
   or copies of Proprietary Information or any such tangible property.

2.   DEVELOPMENTS

a) The Employee will make full and prompt communication to the Company of all
   inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software, and
   works of authorship, whether patentable or not, which are created, made,
   conceived or reduced to practice by him/her or under his/her direction or
   jointly with others during his/her employment by the Company, whether or not
   during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (collectively,
   "Developments").

b) The Employee agrees to transfer and does hereby transfer to the Company (or
   any person or entity designated by the Company) all his/her rights, title and
   interest in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent
   applications, copyrights and copyright applications. However, this paragraph
   2(b) shall not apply to Developments which do not relate to the present or
   planned business or research and development of the Company and which are
   made by the Employee not during normal working hours, not on the Company's
   premises and not using the Company's tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary
   Information. If this Agreement is interpreted under the laws of any state
   that does not permit a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain
   classes of inventions made by an employee, this paragraph 2b will be
   interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the
   Company agrees falls within such classes.

c) In the event that the Company decides that any Development is copyrightable
   or patentable or otherwise registrable, the Employee agrees to assist the
   Company (at its expense) in obtaining and maintaining letters, patents, or
   other applicable registrations and in vesting the Company with full title. If
   the Company is unable to obtain the signature of the Employee on any document
   necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain, or enforce any patent, copyright,
   or other right or protection relating to any Development, the Employee
   irrevocably appoints the Company and each of its authorized officers and
   agents as the Employee's agent to

    do all lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, and
    enforcement of patents, copyrights, or other rights or protection with the
    same force and effect as if executed and delivered by the Employee.

3.  NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION

While the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of one year
after the termination or cessation of such employment for any reason, the
Employee will not directly or indirectly

a)  recruit, solicit, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any employee
    of the Company, or induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company
    to terminate his/her employment with the Company;

b)  solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away any of
    the clients, customers or accounts, or prospective clients, customers or
    accounts, of the Company which were contacted, solicited or served by the
    Employee while employed by the Company.

In addition, if the Employee is a Vice President-, Director- or Senior
Developer-level employee, then, for a period of one year after the termination
or cessation of such employment for any reason, the Employee will not directly
or indirectly in the geographic territory or territories where the Company does
business, as an individual proprietor, partner, officer, employee, director,
joint venturer, consultant or in any other capacity whatsoever (other than as
the holder of not more than one percent of the combined voting power of the
outstanding stock of a publicly held company), develop, design, produce,
market, sell or render (or assist any other person in developing, designing,
producing, marketing, selling or rendering) products or services competitive
with those developed, designed, produced, marketed, sold or rendered by the
Company while the Employee was employed by the Company;

If any restriction set forth in this Section is found by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of
time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area,
it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range
of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.

4.  OTHER AGREEMENTS

The Employee hereby states that, except as the Employee has disclosed in
writing to the Company, the Employee is not obligated by the terms of any
agreement with any previous employer or other party to not use or communicate
any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of
his/her employment with the Company or to not compete, directly or indirectly,
with the business of such previous employer or any other party. The Employee
further states that he/she will not disclose to the Company, or use, or induce
the Company to use, any proprietary information or trade secrets of others.

5.  NOT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

The Employee understands that this Agreement is not a contract of employment
and does not mean that his/her employment will continue for any period of time.
The Employee understands that all employment with the Company is on an "at
will" basis.

6.  MISCELLANEOUS

a)  Even if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable.

b)  This Agreement replaces all previous agreements, written or oral, between
    the Employee and the Company relating to the subject matter of this
    Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified, changed, or terminated in
    whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee
    and the Company.

c) No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement
   by the Company or the Employee will be a waiver of this Agreement.

d) This Agreement will be binding upon the Employee's heirs, executors and
   administrators and may be assigned by the Company and its successors and
   assigns. The Employee expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of
   this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
   of the Company to whom the Employee may be transferred without the necessity
   that this Agreement be re-executed at the time of such transfer.

e) The restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary for the protection
   of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the
   Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. The Employee agrees that any
   breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and
   irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, the
   Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies which
   may be available, shall be entitled to specific performance and other
   injunctive relief.

f) This Agreement is to be interpreted by the laws of the Commonwealth of
   Massachusetts. Any legal proceeding which is commenced to resolve any
   dispute arising under this Agreement shall be commenced only in a court of
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or, if appropriate, a federal court
   located within Massachusetts), and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of
   such court.

THE EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND
UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT.

                                                                  EXHIBIT (d)(5)

June 17, 2002

Mr. Steve S. Benfield
Vice President, Chief Technology Officer
SilverStream Software, Inc.
Two Federal Street
Billerica, MA  01821-3559

Dear Steve:

As you know, Novell, Inc. ("Novell") has entered into a merger agreement with
SilverStream Software, Inc. ("SilverStream"), dated June 9, 2002, (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Delaware Planet Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Novell ("Novell Subsidiary") will make a cash tender offer to acquire all of
the outstanding stock of SilverStream (the "Offer"). After consummation of the
Offer, Novell Subsidiary will be merged with and into SilverStream, with
SilverStream becoming the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Novell (the "Merger").

The purpose of this letter agreement is to (i) confirm the terms of your
continued employment with SilverStream or Novell for a minimal period of 6
months after consummation of the merger, and (ii) confirm your reaffirmation of
the terms of SilverStream's Standard Employee Agreement, as set forth on Exhibit
A (the "SilverStream Agreement"), or, if you have not previously executed the
SilverStream Agreement, your agreement to the terms of the SilverStream
Agreement, in either case as further modified by this letter; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not become effective if the Merger is not consummated.
More specifically, in consideration of the position and benefits outlined in
this letter, to induce Novell to enter into the Merger Agreement and to perform
its obligations thereunder, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, by signing this
letter, you agree to the reaffirmation of the SilverStream Agreement, or, in the
event you have not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, to execute
the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as further modified by this letter;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not become effective if the Merger
is not consummated. You will have the following title and be eligible for the
following benefits after the Merger:

         -        After consummation of the Merger, you will be employed by
                  SilverStream or Novell in your current position of Vice
                  President, Chief Technology Officer with a rate of pay equal
                  to $7,083.33 semi-monthly (less applicable withholding), which
                  is $170,000.00 annualized (less applicable withholding),
                  payable in accordance with SilverStream's or Novell's payroll
                  practices. Such rate of pay is exclusive of bonuses,
                  commissions and other incentive pay you may receive during
                  your employment.

         -        If the Merger is consummated, your outstanding SilverStream
                  stock options, whether or not vested or exercisable as of the
                  date of the consummation of the Merger, will be assumed by
                  Novell and converted into stock options to acquire Novell
                  stock (subject to the Merger's exchange ratio, as will be set
                  forth in the Merger Agreement), with continued vesting and
                  exercisability in such options on the vesting and
                  exercisability schedule effective immediately prior to their
                  assumption.

         -        If the Merger is consummated, if your employment with
                  SilverStream or Novell is terminated (i) due to your
                  resignation or (ii) by SilverStream or Novell for any reason
                  other than Cause (as defined below), after the consummation of
                  the Merger; provided in either case you execute, and do not
                  revoke, a release of claims in a form satisfactory to Novell,
                  you will receive severance benefits in an amount that is equal
                  to one year of your then current annual base salary, as in
                  effect immediately prior to your termination of employment.
                  Such severance benefits shall be in lieu of any severance
                  program or plan maintained by SilverStream or Novell, and
                  shall be paid to you in one lump sum (less applicable
                  withholding) after your termination of employment with
                  SilverStream or Novell in accordance with SilverStream's or
                  Novell's payroll practices.

         -        Novell intends to continue SilverStream's current employee
                  benefits programs after the Merger through December 31, 2002.
                  While you are employed by SilverStream or Novell, you will be
                  eligible to participate in these employee benefit programs at
                  the same levels and with the same benefits, in the aggregate,
                  as other similarly-situated employees of SilverStream or
                  Novell. If the Merger is consummated, if your employment with
                  SilverStream or Novell is terminated (i) due to your
                  resignation or (ii) by SilverStream or Novell for any reason
                  other than Cause, after the consummation of the Merger, if you
                  elect to receive healthcare benefits under COBRA, Novell will
                  make COBRA healthcare (medical and dental) payments on your
                  behalf to the applicable medical and/or dental insurance
                  provider for a period that is no longer than 12 months after
                  your termination of employment.

         -        Provided that you remain employed by SilverStream or Novell
                  for a minimum of 6 months after the consummation of the
                  Merger, or such longer period as

                  mutually agreed to between you and SilverStream or Novell, you
                  will receive a cash stay bonus equal to 50% of your base
                  salary earned during the stay period (excluding vacation hours
                  taken), plus an additional month's base salary (less
                  applicable withholding). This stay bonus will be paid to you
                  after your termination of employment with SilverStream or
                  Novell in accordance with SilverStream's or Novell's payroll
                  practices. If you voluntarily resign from SilverStream or
                  Novell prior to the end of the requested stay period or are
                  terminated by SilverStream or Novell for Cause prior to the
                  end of the requested stay period, you will not receive any
                  portion of the stay bonus. If your employment with
                  SilverStream or Novell terminates for any reason other than
                  that provided in the preceding sentence, you will be entitled
                  to the stay bonus that you would have been provided if you
                  remain employed by SilverStream or Novell for the entire stay
                  period.

         -        As a condition to receiving the title and benefits described
                  above in connection with your continued employment with
                  SilverStream or Novell after consummation of the Merger, you
                  must reaffirm your acceptance to the terms of the SilverStream
                  Agreement in its entirety, or, if you have not previously
                  executed the SilverStream Agreement, you agree to execute the
                  SilverStream Agreement, except that in either case, the
                  SilverStream Agreement shall be amended to provide that (i)
                  the non-solicitation period in Section 3 thereof shall
                  continue for a period of two years after your termination or
                  cessation of employment for any reason, (ii) the term
                  "Company" shall be amended to mean the Company and all of its
                  subsidiary and affiliated companies as they may exist from
                  time to time, whether or not you are employed by any such
                  subsidiary or affiliated companies, (iii) the second sentence
                  of Section 6(d) shall be deleted, and (iv) the term
                  "Development" shall be amended to include intellectual
                  property owned by you, or in which you have an interest, that
                  is or has been incorporated in a Company product, service,
                  process, software or other property. In addition, after
                  consummation of the Merger, you will be required to execute
                  Novell's Code of Business Ethics, which is required for all
                  employees of Novell and its subsidiaries.

For purposes of this letter, "Cause" shall mean your (i) demonstrably willful or
deliberate violation of your obligations with respect to your employment with
SilverStream or Novell, (ii) engaging in willful misconduct which is injurious
to SilverStream or Novell or their affiliates, (iii) committing a felony, an act
of fraud against or the misappropriation of property belonging to SilverStream
or Novell or their affiliates, (iv) breaching, in any material respect, terms of
any confidentiality or proprietary information agreement between you and
SilverStream or Novell, or (v) breaching any written noncompetition or
nonsolicitation agreement between you and SilverStream or Novell.

Please signify acceptance of this offer of continued employment with
SilverStream or Novell, as well as your reaffirmation of the SilverStream
Agreement, or, in the event you have not previously executed the SilverStream
Agreement, you execute the SilverStream

Agreement, in either case as further modified by this letter, by executing this
letter agreement. You must return an executed copy of this letter agreement and

Sincerely,

Alan J. Friedman
Senior Vice President, People

market, sell or render (or assist any other person in developing, designing,
producing, marketing, selling or rendering) products or services competitive
with those developed, designed, produced, marketed, sold or rendered by the
Company while the Employee was employed by the Company;

If any restriction set forth in this Section is found by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of
time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area,
it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range
of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.

4.  OTHER AGREEMENTS

writing to the Company, the Employee is not obligated by the terms of any

any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of

with the business of such previous employer or any other party. The Employee
further states that he/she will not disclose to the Company, or use, or induce
the Company to use, any proprietary information or trade secrets of others.

and does not mean that his/her employment will continue for any period of time.
The Employee understands that all employment with the Company is on an "at
will" basis.

6.  MISCELLANEOUS

    unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable.

b)  This Agreement replaces all previous agreements, written or oral, between

    Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified, changed, or terminated in
    whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee
    and the Company.

c) No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement
   by the Company or the Employee will be a waiver of this Agreement.

   administrators and may be assigned by the Company and its successors and
   assigns. The Employee expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of
   this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
   of the Company to whom the Employee may be transferred without the necessity
   that this Agreement be re-executed at the time of such transfer.

e) The restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary for the protection
   of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the
   Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. The Employee agrees that any
   breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and
   irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, the
   Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies which
   may be available, shall be entitled to specific performance and other

OFFER LETTER AMONG NOVELL AND ROGER DURN

                                                                  Exhibit (d)(6)

June 5, 2002

Mr.  Roger Durn
Vice President, Asia Pacific
SilverStream Software, Inc.
Two Federal Street
Billerica, MA  01821-3559

Dear Roger:

As you know, Novell is currently negotiating with SilverStream to enter into a
merger agreement with SilverStream and Novell, Inc. Subsidiary, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Novell ("Novell Subsidiary") (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which Novell Subsidiary will make a cash tender offer to acquire all of the
outstanding stock of SilverStream (the "Offer"). After consummation of the
Offer, Novell Subsidiary will be merged with and into SilverStream, with
SilverStream becoming the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Novell (the "Merger").

The purpose of this letter agreement is to (i) confirm the terms of your
continued employment with SilverStream OR Novell after consummation of the
Merger, (ii) confirm your reaffirmation of the terms of SilverStream's Standard
Employee Agreement, as set forth on Exhibit A (the "SilverStream Agreement"),
or, if you have not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, your
agreement to the terms of the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as further
modified by this letter, and (iii) confirm your agreement to waive your rights
to accelerated vesting and exercisability under the terms of any of your stock
option agreements and any amendment to your outstanding stock option agreements;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not become effective if the Merger
is not consummated. More specifically, in consideration of the position and
benefits outlined in this letter, to induce Novell to enter into the Merger
Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, by signing this letter, you agree (i) to the reaffirmation of the
SilverStream Agreement, or, in the event you have not previously executed the
SilverStream Agreement, to execute the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as
further modified by this letter, and (ii) that immediately prior to execution of
the Merger Agreement by Novell, your rights to the accelerated vesting

and exercisability of your stock options, as set forth in your stock option
agreements, any amendment to your stock option agreements or otherwise, will be
of no further force and effect; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
become effective if the Merger is not consummated. You will have the following
title and be eligible for the following benefits after the Merger:

     -    After consummation of the Merger, you will be employed by SilverStream
          OR Novell in the position of Vice President, Asia Pacific with a rate
          of pay equal to $7,916.67 semi-monthly (less applicable withholding),
          which is $190,000.00 annualized (less applicable withholding), payable
          in accordance with SilverStream's payroll practices. Such rate of pay
          is exclusive of bonuses, commissions and other incentive pay you may
          receive during your employment. In this position you will report to
          David Litwack.

     -    In addition to your base salary, you will also be eligible to
          participate in the SilverStream Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan")
          after consummation of the Merger. Under the Incentive Plan, as an
          eligible employee, you may receive an annual incentive award that will
          be $75,000.00 annualized run rate through October 31, 2002. Your
          incentive for fiscal year 2003 will be no less than your current
          SilverStream incentive potential.

     -    After consummation of the Merger, subject to approval by Novell's
          Board of Directors, you will be granted a nonqualified stock option to
          purchase 20,000 shares of Novell common stock at an exercise price
          equal to the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the
          applicable Novell stock option plan) of the stock on the date of
          grant. Your stock option will vest and become exercisable according to
          the following schedule:

          Options vest and become exercisable over a 4 year period; with 25%
          vesting and becoming exercisable one year from the date of grant and
          monthly vesting thereafter.

     -    Your outstanding SilverStream stock options, whether or not vested or
          exercisable as of the date of the consummation of the Merger, will be
          assumed by Novell and converted into stock options to acquire Novell
          stock (subject to the Merger's exchange ratio, as will be set forth in
          the Merger Agreement), with continued vesting and exercisability in
          such options on the vesting and exercisability schedule effective
          immediately prior to their assumption and not subject to any
          accelerated vesting and exercisability as a result of the consummation
          of the Merger.

     -    You will become eligible to participate in the Novell Limited
          Severance Plan after consummation of the Merger. Your severance
          protection will be equivalent to that provided to a similarly-situated
          Novell employee. As a participant, if you are permanently laid off for
          a reason other than cause, you

          will be eligible to receive the greater of either (i) 6 months (of
          monthly pay) or (ii) 2 months (of monthly pay) plus 1 week (of weekly
          pay) for every 1 year of service calculated at your then current base
          salary.

     -    Novell intends to continue SilverStream's current employee benefits
          programs after the Merger through December 31, 2002, and, thereafter,
          you will become eligible to participate in Novell's employee benefits
          programs at the same levels and with the same benefits as other
          similarly-situated Novell employees. These programs include, but are
          not limited to, medical, dental, life insurance, disability benefits,
          401(k) plan, paid holidays, and flexible time off.

     -    As a condition to receiving the title and benefits described above in
          connection with your continued employment with SilverStream OR Novell
          after consummation of the Merger, you must reaffirm your acceptance to
          the terms of the SilverStream Agreement in its entirety, or, if you
          have not previously executed the SilverStream Agreement, you agree to
          execute the SilverStream Agreement, except that in either case, the
          SilverStream Agreement shall be amended to provide that (i) the
          non-solicitation period in Section 3 thereof shall continue for a
          period of two years after your termination or cessation of employment
          for any reason, (ii) the term "Company" shall be amended to mean the
          Company and all of its subsidiary and affiliated companies as they may
          exist from time to time, whether or not you are employed by any such
          subsidiary or affiliated companies, (iii) the second sentence of
          Section 6(d) shall be deleted, and (iv) the term "Development" shall
          be amended to include intellectual property owned by you, or in which
          you have an interest, that is or has been incorporated in a Company
          product, service, process, software or other property. In addition,
          after consummation of the Merger, you will be required to execute
          Novell's Code of Business Ethics, which is required for all employees
          of Novell and its subsidiaries.

Please signify acceptance of this offer of continued employment with
SilverStream or Novell, as well as your reaffirmation of the SilverStream
Agreement, or, in the event you have not previously executed the SilverStream
Agreement, you execute the SilverStream Agreement, in either case as further
modified by this letter, and your waiver of any provision under your stock
option agreements and any amendment to your stock option agreements that
provides for the accelerated vesting and exercisability of your outstanding
SilverStream stock options as a result of the Merger, by executing this letter

Dated: June 7, 2002.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                    SILVERSTREAM STANDARD EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

                    SILVERSTREAM STANDARD EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

This agreement is made between SilverStream Software Inc. (the "Company"), and
__________________________________________ (the "Employee").

In consideration of the employment or the continued employment of the Employee
by the Company, the Company and the Employee agree as follows:

1.   PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

a) The Employee agrees that all information, whether or not in writing, of a
   private, secret or confidential nature concerning the Company's business,
   business relationships or financial affairs (collectively, "Proprietary
   Information") is and will continue to be the exclusive property of the
   Company. In order to illustrate this definition, Proprietary Information may
   include, without limitation, inventions, products, processes, methods,
   techniques, formulas, compositions, compounds, projects, developments, plans,
   research data, clinical data, financial data, personnel data, computer
   programs, customer and supplier lists, and contact at or knowledge of
   customers or prospective customers of the Company, as well as materials and
   tangible property of customers of the Company or suppliers to the Company.
   The Employee will not communicate any Proprietary Information to any person
   or entity other than employees of the Company or use Proprietary Information
   for any purpose (other than in the performance of his/her duties as an
   employee of the Company) without written approval by an officer of the
   Company, either during or after his/her employment with the Company, unless
   and until such Proprietary Information has become public knowledge without
   activity by the Employee.

b) The Employee agrees to return promptly to the Company, upon (i) a request by
   the Company or (ii) termination of his/her employment, whichever is earlier,
   all Proprietary Information and all tangible property furnished to or
   prepared by the Employee in the course of or relating to his/her employment.
   After such delivery, the Employee shall not keep any Proprietary Information
   or copies of Proprietary Information or any such tangible property.

2.   DEVELOPMENTS

a) The Employee will make full and prompt communication to the Company of all
   inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software, and
   works of authorship, whether patentable or not, which are created, made,
   conceived or reduced to practice by him/her or under his/her direction or
   jointly with others during his/her employment by the Company, whether or not
   during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (collectively,
   "Developments").

b) The Employee agrees to transfer and does hereby transfer to the Company (or
   any person or entity designated by the Company) all his/her rights, title and
   interest in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent
   applications, copyrights and copyright applications. However, this paragraph
   2(b) shall not apply to Developments which do not relate to the present or
   planned business or research and development of the Company and which are
   made by the Employee not during normal working hours, not on the Company's
   premises and not using the Company's tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary
   Information. If this Agreement is interpreted under the laws of any state
   that does not permit a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain
   classes of inventions made by an employee, this paragraph 2b will be
   interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the
   Company agrees falls within such classes.

c) In the event that the Company decides that any Development is copyrightable
   or patentable or otherwise registrable, the Employee agrees to assist the
   Company (at its expense) in obtaining and maintaining letters, patents, or
   other applicable registrations and in vesting the Company with full title. If
   the Company is unable to obtain the signature of the Employee on any document
   necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain, or enforce any patent, copyright,
   or other right or protection relating to any Development, the Employee
   irrevocably appoints the Company and each of its authorized officers and
   agents as the Employee's agent to

    do all lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, and
    enforcement of patents, copyrights, or other rights or protection with the
    same force and effect as if executed and delivered by the Employee.

3.  NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION

While the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of one year
after the termination or cessation of such employment for any reason, the
Employee will not directly or indirectly

a)  recruit, solicit, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any employee
    of the Company, or induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company
    to terminate his/her employment with the Company;

b)  solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away any of
    the clients, customers or accounts, or prospective clients, customers or
    accounts, of the Company which were contacted, solicited or served by the
    Employee while employed by the Company.

In addition, if the Employee is a Vice President-, Director- or Senior
Developer-level employee, then, for a period of one year after the termination
or cessation of such employment for any reason, the Employee will not directly
or indirectly in the geographic territory or territories where the Company does
business, as an individual proprietor, partner, officer, employee, director,
joint venturer, consultant or in any other capacity whatsoever (other than as
the holder of not more than one percent of the combined voting power of the
outstanding stock of a publicly held company), develop, design, produce,
market, sell or render (or assist any other person in developing, designing,
producing, marketing, selling or rendering) products or services competitive
with those developed, designed, produced, marketed, sold or rendered by the
Company while the Employee was employed by the Company;

If any restriction set forth in this Section is found by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of
time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area,
it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range
of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.

4.  OTHER AGREEMENTS

The Employee hereby states that, except as the Employee has disclosed in
writing to the Company, the Employee is not obligated by the terms of any
agreement with any previous employer or other party to not use or communicate
any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of
his/her employment with the Company or to not compete, directly or indirectly,
with the business of such previous employer or any other party. The Employee
further states that he/she will not disclose to the Company, or use, or induce
the Company to use, any proprietary information or trade secrets of others.

5.  NOT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

The Employee understands that this Agreement is not a contract of employment
and does not mean that his/her employment will continue for any period of time.
The Employee understands that all employment with the Company is on an "at
will" basis.

6.  MISCELLANEOUS

a)  Even if one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable.

b)  This Agreement replaces all previous agreements, written or oral, between
    the Employee and the Company relating to the subject matter of this
    Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified, changed, or terminated in
    whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Employee
    and the Company.

c) No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement
   by the Company or the Employee will be a waiver of this Agreement.

d) This Agreement will be binding upon the Employee's heirs, executors and
   administrators and may be assigned by the Company and its successors and
   assigns. The Employee expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of
   this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
   of the Company to whom the Employee may be transferred without the necessity
   that this Agreement be re-executed at the time of such transfer.

e) The restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary for the protection
   of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the
   Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. The Employee agrees that any
   breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and
   irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, the
   Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies which
   may be available, shall be entitled to specific performance and other
   injunctive relief.

f) This Agreement is to be interpreted by the laws of the Commonwealth of
   Massachusetts. Any legal proceeding which is commenced to resolve any
   dispute arising under this Agreement shall be commenced only in a court of
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or, if appropriate, a federal court
   located within Massachusetts), and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of
   such court.

THE EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND
UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT.
