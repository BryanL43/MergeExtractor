We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to holders of MessageMedia
common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies by MessageMedia's
board of directors for use at MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting to be
held on [            ], 2001, and any adjournment or postponement of that
meeting.

    
This proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed to MessageMedia
stockholders on or about [            ], 2001.
This proxy statement/prospectus
is also being furnished to MessageMedia's stockholders as a prospectus in
connection with the issuance by DoubleClick of shares of DoubleClick common
stock as contemplated by the amended merger agreement.


DATE, TIME AND PLACE

    MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting will be held on [            ],
2001 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at MessageMedia's principal offices, located at
371 Centennial Parkway, Louisville, Colorado 80027.


MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

    At the MessageMedia special stockholders' meeting, and any adjournment or
postponement of the special stockholders' meeting, MessageMedia stockholders
will be asked to:

     consider and vote upon the adoption of the amended merger agreement;

     grant MessageMedia's board of directors discretionary authority to adjourn
     the special stockholders' meeting to solicit additional votes for adoption
     of the agreement; and

     transact such other business as may properly come before the special
     stockholders' meeting.


RECORD DATE

    MessageMedia's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[            ], 2001 as the record date for determination of MessageMedia's
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special stockholders'
meeting.


VOTING OF PROXIES

    MessageMedia requests that its stockholders complete, date and sign the
accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or
otherwise mail it to MessageMedia.
Brokers holding shares in 'street name' may
vote the shares only if the stockholder provides instructions on how to vote.

Brokers will provide instructions to beneficial owners on how to direct the
broker to vote the shares.
All properly executed proxies that MessageMedia
receives prior to the vote at the special stockholders' meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no direction is indicated, to adopt the amended merger agreement.

MessageMedia's board of directors does not currently intend to bring any other
business before the special stockholders' meeting and MessageMedia's board of
directors currently is not aware of any other matters to be brought before the
special stockholders' meeting.
If other business properly comes before the
special stockholders' meeting, the proxies will be voted in accordance with the
judgment of the proxyholders.

    
A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time prior to its use:

     by delivering to the Secretary of MessageMedia a signed notice of
     revocation or a later-dated, signed proxy; or

     by attending the special stockholders' meeting and voting in person.

    
Attendance at the special stockholders' meeting does not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.


VOTE REQUIRED

    As of the close of business on [            ], 2001, there were [        ]
shares of MessageMedia common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
The
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of MessageMedia
common stock outstanding as of this date is required to adopt the amended merger
agreement.
MessageMedia stockholders have one vote per share of MessageMedia
common stock owned on the record date.

    
As of [            ], 2001, directors and executive officers of MessageMedia
and their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of [        ] shares of
MessageMedia common stock (exclusive of any shares issuable upon the exercise of
options or warrants), or approximately [  ]% of the shares of MessageMedia
common stock outstanding on such date.
Pursuant to stockholder agreements in the
form attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B [(and stockholder
letters in the form attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix B-1)], MessageMedia stockholders have agreed to vote 25,661,381 shares
of MessageMedia common stock (or approximately [37.4]% of MessageMedia's common
stock outstanding as of [            ], 2001) for adoption of the amended merger
agreement.
As of [            ], 2001, directors and executive officers of
DoubleClick did not own any shares of MessageMedia common stock.
See 'The
Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.'

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

    The required quorum for the transaction of business at the MessageMedia
special stockholders' meeting is a majority of the shares of MessageMedia common
stock issued and outstanding on the record date.
Abstentions and broker
non-votes each will be included in determining the number of shares present at
the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Because
adoption of the amended merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of MessageMedia common stock entitled to
vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes
against adoption of the amended merger agreement.
In addition, the failure of a
MessageMedia stockholder to return a proxy or otherwise vote will have the
effect of a vote against adoption of the amended merger agreement.
Brokers
holding shares for beneficial owners cannot vote on the actions proposed in this
proxy statement/prospectus without the owners' specific instructions.

Accordingly, MessageMedia stockholders are urged to return the enclosed proxy
card marked to indicate their vote.


SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

    In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of MessageMedia may solicit proxies from MessageMedia's stockholders by
telephone, facsimile or in person.
No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees of MessageMedia for any solicitations.

Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested
to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for
their reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to beneficial
owners.
The expenses of soliciting proxies, including expenses related to the
printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, are being shared
equally by DoubleClick and MessageMedia.

                                   
THE MERGER

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of
the proposed merger.
While we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain
all of the information that is important to you.
MessageMedia stockholders
should read the entire amended merger agreement and the other documents we refer
to carefully and in their entirety for a more complete understanding of the
merger.


BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    During the first week of January 2001, Court Cunningham, DoubleClick's Vice
President and General Manager of DARTMail Technology, called A. Laurence Jones,
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mary Beth Loesch,
MessageMedia's Senior Vice President Corporate Development, to set up a meeting
on January 8, 2001 to discuss ways in which DoubleClick and MessageMedia could
potentially work together.
At this meeting, Mr. Cunningham provided a high level
overview of DoubleClick's strategy in email marketing.

    
On January 18, 2001, Mr. Cunningham and David Rosenblatt, DoubleClick's
President of Technology, Data and Research, called Mr. Jones and Ms. Loesch to
express DoubleClick's interest in continuing discussions with MessageMedia.

    
On February 6, 2001, during a regularly scheduled meeting of the
MessageMedia board of directors, the board discussed strategic options for
MessageMedia, including a business combination with DoubleClick.
After the
meeting, Gerald Poch, Co-Chairman of the MessageMedia board of directors, called
Kevin Ryan, DoubleClick's Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jones called Mr.
Cunningham.
The parties agreed to schedule a subsequent meeting with several
senior executives of each company.

    
On February 21, 2001, Messrs. Ryan, Rosenblatt and Cunningham, Jeffrey
Epstein, Executive Vice President of DoubleClick, Jonathan Shapiro,
DoubleClick's Senior Vice President of Strategy, Jennifer Haggerty, Director of
Corporate Development at DoubleClick and Steven Cohn, an analyst in the
Corporate Development group of DoubleClick, met at DoubleClick's New York
offices with Messrs. Poch and Jones and Ms. Loesch to discuss the operations and
business strategies of MessageMedia and DoubleClick.

    
Based on the previous day's discussions, on February 22, 2001, Mses.
Haggerty and Loesch executed a mutual confidentiality agreement on behalf of
DoubleClick and MessageMedia.

    
On March 16, 2001, Ms. Haggerty discussed the preliminary terms of a
potential acquisition of MessageMedia with Mr. Poch and separately with Ms.
Loesch.

    
On March 20, 2001, Mr. Cunningham and Scott Knoll, DoubleClick's Vice
President of Operations, Global TechSolutions, met at MessageMedia's offices in
Louisville, Colorado with Mr. Jones, Ms. Loesch and Prabhuling Patel,
MessageMedia's Senior Vice President and General Manager of Online Marketing and
Communications.
At this meeting, Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Knoll learned more about
MessageMedia's products and services.

    
On March 23, 2001, Jeremy Palley, an associate in the Corporate Development
group of DoubleClick, called Ms. Loesch and made a verbal non-binding offer for
DoubleClick to acquire MessageMedia in a stock-for-stock exchange.
Following
this discussion, Ms. Haggerty submitted a non-binding indication of interest and
term sheet to Ms. Loesch.

    
On March 27, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met to discuss a
potential combination with DoubleClick.
Between March 27 and March 30, 2001, a
series of telephone conversations took place between senior representatives of
DoubleClick and MessageMedia to discuss the terms of a potential business
combination.
On March 30, 2001, MessageMedia and DoubleClick determined that the
stage of their discussions justified commencing mutual due diligence and the
negotiation of definitive documentation, all subject to the approval of each
company's board of directors.
On March 30, 2001, MessageMedia entered into a
limited duration exclusivity agreement with DoubleClick.

    
On April 2 and April 3, 2001, a team from DoubleClick and attorneys from
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, DoubleClick's legal counsel, met with
representatives from MessageMedia and with

attorneys from Cooley Godward LLP, MessageMedia's legal counsel, at the offices
of Cooley Godward in Broomfield, Colorado.
The purpose of these meetings was to
conduct business, financial and legal due diligence.

    
On April 5, 2001, Mr. Ryan telephoned Mr. Jones, and Ms. Haggerty telephoned
Ms. Loesch, to inform them that DoubleClick was not interested in pursuing a
business combination with MessageMedia based on then current business
conditions, and the parties terminated the exclusivity agreement.
On April 11,
2001, Ms. Haggerty confirmed with Ms. Loesch that DoubleClick was not interested
in pursuing a transaction with MessageMedia.

    
On April 12, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met during a
regularly scheduled meeting and engaged Stephens Inc. to act as MessageMedia's
financial advisor, including advising the board as to financial and strategic
alternatives.
In late April 2001, Stephens solicited indications of interest for
the acquisition of MessageMedia and received indications of interest from a
number of parties.
On May 2, 2001, MessageMedia received a call from an
enterprise web solutions company's financial advisor expressing such company's
interest in acquiring MessageMedia.
MessageMedia executives and their financial
advisors met with this company and its financial advisors on May 11, 2001 at
MessageMedia's offices in Louisville, Colorado.
On May 15, 2001, MessageMedia
executives and their financial advisors again met with this company to discuss
terms of a potential business combination.

    
On May 16, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met to discuss the
proposed transaction with the enterprise web solutions company and the status
of other firms that had expressed an interest in acquiring MessageMedia to
Stephens during its marketing process.
The discussion focused on the strategic
fit of the potential acquirers, such as cross-selling opportunities, the
strength of the potential acquirers' financial condition, the ability to
increase the scale and scope of the operations of the combined entity and
efficiencies that could be achieved through a combination.
The board of
directors authorized Mr. Jones to continue discussions with the enterprise web
solutions company and also to contact DoubleClick before entering into an
exclusive arrangement with the enterprise web solutions company.

    
Following the May 16, 2001 MessageMedia board meeting, Mr. Jones placed
calls to Messrs. Ryan and Epstein at DoubleClick to determine whether
DoubleClick would be interested in acquiring MessageMedia.
On May 17, 2001, Mr.
Jones, Ms. Loesch, William Buchholz, MessageMedia's Senior Vice President,
Finance and Administration, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Pat
Hayes, MessageMedia's Director Financial Planning, had a telephone conference
call with Mr. Cunningham and William Mills, DoubleClick's Vice President of
Corporate Development, to provide an update on the MessageMedia business.

    
On May 18, 2001, Ms. Haggerty and Mr. Cunningham called Ms. Loesch to
further discuss the update on the MessageMedia business and the potential terms
of a business combination.
Ms. Haggerty then delivered a non-binding term sheet
to Ms. Loesch which reflected the terms discussed.
Over the next few days,
representatives from DoubleClick and MessageMedia held a series of telephone
conversations to discuss the potential terms of a business combination.

    
On May 21, 2001, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison delivered an initial draft of
the merger agreement to MessageMedia and Cooley Godward.
That same day,
representatives of DoubleClick, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, Cooley Godward and
MessageMedia resumed business, financial and legal due diligence of MessageMedia
and DoubleClick at the Broomfield, Colorado offices of Cooley Godward.
The due
diligence inspections included numerous discussions between senior management of
both companies regarding various business, financial, operational and technical
issues involved in combining the companies.

    
On May 24, 2001, Messrs. Ryan, Epstein, Rosenblatt and Cunningham, Ms.
Haggerty, Elizabeth Wang, Vice President and General Counsel of DoubleClick,
Bruce Dalziel, Vice President of Finance and Operations, Tech, Data and Research
at DoubleClick and Benjamin Naftalis, an analyst in the Corporate Development
group of DoubleClick, discussed the proposed transaction at a meeting of
DoubleClick's board of directors.
DoubleClick's board engaged in a full
discussion of the terms of the proposed merger, including the strategic benefits
of the combination, financial and legal analyses, the terms and conditions of
the proposed merger agreement and the analyses and opinion of DoubleClick's

management.
Following the discussion, the DoubleClick board of directors
approved the terms of the merger, including the issuance of DoubleClick common
stock in the merger, and authorized management to continue to negotiate the
final terms of the merger agreement and related agreements.
That same day,
MessageMedia's management determined that a combination with DoubleClick
represented the most attractive strategic alternative then available to
MessageMedia, and DoubleClick and MessageMedia entered into a second limited
duration exclusivity agreement.
Representatives of DoubleClick and
MessageMedia then began to negotiate the merger agreement.
These discussions
continued that week and throughout the next week.

    
Beginning May 30, 2001, the parties convened at the Broomfield, Colorado
offices of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison to finalize the documentation of the
merger.

    
On May 30, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors held a special meeting
to discuss the proposed business combination.
Attorneys from Cooley Godward
reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement and the related agreements
with the board.
MessageMedia's management, legal counsel and financial advisors
reported on the results of their due diligence reviews of DoubleClick.
Stephens
then made a presentation to the MessageMedia board of directors regarding the
financial analyses it performed in connection with its opinion and stated orally
that Stephens was prepared to render a written opinion to the effect that, based
on the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of its review set forth
in its opinion, the share exchange ratio in the merger was fair to
MessageMedia's disinterested stockholders from a financial point of view.

Following a discussion, the MessageMedia board of directors stated that it was
prepared to approve the final terms of the merger agreement and related
agreements, subject to the resolution of several transaction issues.
The meeting
was adjourned until May 31, 2001.

    
On May 31, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors (with Messrs. Diamond
and Duryea absent) reconvened the special meeting begun on May 30, 2001, and
MessageMedia's management, legal counsel and financial advisors updated the
MessageMedia board of directors on negotiations and related transaction issues.

Following the discussion, all members of the MessageMedia board of directors who
were present at the special meeting approved the terms of the merger agreement
and related agreements.
All of MessageMedia's directors subsequently approved
the terms of the merger agreement in a unanimous written consent.

    
On June 1, 2001, the merger agreement was signed and DoubleClick and
MessageMedia jointly announced the agreement to merge.

    
DoubleClick subsequently decided to exercise its right, contained in
the merger agreement, to change the method of effecting the business combination
between DoubleClick and MessageMedia in order to minimize the risk of the merger
not qualifying as a tax-deferred 'reorganization' for United States federal
income tax purposes, as the parties originally intended.
After discussions,
DoubleClick and MessageMedia determined that it would be advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to merge
MessageMedia with and into DoubleClick, instead of merging Atlas Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of DoubleClick, with and into MessageMedia.
On
June 26, 2001, DoubleClick, MessageMedia and Atlas Acquisition Corp. signed an
amendment to the merger agreement to reflect the change in structure.


DOUBLECLICK'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    The DoubleClick board of directors unanimously determined that the merger is
fair to, and in the best interest of, DoubleClick and its stockholders.

    
This determination was based on several potential benefits of the merger
that the DoubleClick board believes will contribute to DoubleClick's success,
including:

     the ability to enhance DoubleClick's email technology business by making
     more innovative products available to more customers;

     the ability of DoubleClick to sell MessageMedia's products and services
     through DoubleClick's substantially larger sales network and large customer
     base, and to sell its own products and services to MessageMedia's
     customers;

     the quality and loyalty of MessageMedia's customer base;

     the perceived value of MessageMedia's business relative to the value of the
     merger consideration;

     MessageMedia's skilled workforce; and

     the ability of DoubleClick to enhance MessageMedia's products and services
     with added features and better meet the needs of MessageMedia's existing
     and future customer base.

    
The DoubleClick board of directors reviewed a number of factors in
evaluating the merger, including, but not limited to, the following:

     information concerning DoubleClick's and MessageMedia's respective
     businesses, customers, prospects, strategic business plans, financial
     performance and condition, results of operations, technology positions,
     management and competitive positions;

     the due diligence investigation of MessageMedia conducted by DoubleClick's
     management and legal advisors;

     DoubleClick management's view of the positive results of combining the
     operations and businesses of DoubleClick and MessageMedia;

     the current financial market conditions and historical stock market prices,
     volatility and trading information of MessageMedia and DoubleClick; and

     the impact of the merger on DoubleClick's customers and employees.

    
During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger, the
DoubleClick board also identified and considered a variety of potentially
negative factors that could materialize as a result of the merger, including the
following:

     the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
     realized;

     the possibility that the merger might not be completed;

     risks related to retaining key MessageMedia employees;

     risks related to retaining key MessageMedia customers;

     the effect of the public announcement of the merger on MessageMedia's
     business, including its employees and customers; and

     the uncertainty concerning the liabilities of MessageMedia
     Europe, B.V.

    The DoubleClick board of directors concluded that these factors were
outweighed by the potential benefits to be gained by the merger.
In view of the
wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered by the
DoubleClick board of directors, the directors did not find it practical to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
discussed above.


MESSAGEMEDIA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION OF
MESSAGEMEDIA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER

    The MessageMedia board of directors determined to enter into the merger
agreement and to recommend that MessageMedia stockholders approve the merger
agreement in pursuit of MessageMedia's strategy to join with a company with a
strong commitment to the email marketing business.

    
The decision of the MessageMedia board of directors was the result of its
careful consideration of a range of strategic alternatives, including potential
business combinations with DoubleClick and other companies, in the pursuit of
its long-term business strategy.

    
The MessageMedia board of directors' primary consideration was to identify
and secure the alternative that would provide the best strategic fit for
MessageMedia and to provide long-term stockholder value to MessageMedia
stockholders.
In this regard, the MessageMedia board of directors concluded that
a combination with DoubleClick represents the best transaction among other

alternatives considered by the MessageMedia board of directors.
In reaching this
determination, the MessageMedia board of directors considered the following
factors:

     the price per share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger, based on
     DoubleClick's 10-day average closing stock price ending May 31, 2001, which
     the MessageMedia board of directors determined represents: (A) a premium of
     40% over the closing price of MessageMedia common stock as of the last
     trading day prior to the announcement of the merger and (B) a premium of
     42% over the average closing price of MessageMedia common stock in the 10
     trading days prior to the announcement of the merger;

     the exchange ratio in the merger and the implied per share price, which
     compares favorably according to a number of applicable valuation
     methodologies, including the analysis of companies comparable to
     MessageMedia and transactions comparable to the merger used by Stephens in
     connection with providing its fairness opinion to the MessageMedia board of
     directors; and

     the opinion of Stephens delivered in writing on May 31, 2001, that as of
     May 31, 2001, and subject to assumptions made, matters considered and
     limitations on the review set forth in its opinion, the share exchange
     ratio in the merger is fair to MessageMedia's disinterested stockholders
     from a financial point of view.
Please see ' -- Opinion of MessageMedia's
     Financial Advisor.'

    
The MessageMedia board of directors also believes that the merger will
provide the opportunity for the combined company to:

     sell MessageMedia's products and services through DoubleClick's
     substantially larger sales network and large customer base, and sell
     DoubleClick's products and services to MessageMedia's customers;

     increase the scale and scope of the messaging business of the combined
     company; and

     achieve certain cost synergies and economies of scope and scale by
     eliminating duplicative costs.

    
In reviewing its alternatives and making its determination to approve the
merger, the MessageMedia board of directors reviewed:

     the results of the due diligence review by MessageMedia's management, legal
     advisors and financial advisors regarding DoubleClick's business,
     operations, technology and financial and competitive position;

     the financial strength of DoubleClick;

     the expected notice from The Nasdaq National Market as to the delisting of
     MessageMedia's common stock;

     possible expansion opportunities for the combined company and the ability
     for the combined company to realize cost-reduction opportunities;

     the current and prospective business environment in which MessageMedia
     operates; and

     the competitive environment.

    
The MessageMedia board of directors also reviewed with its legal advisors:

     the terms and conditions of the merger agreement;

     the terms and conditions of the stockholder agreements;

     the events triggering payment of the termination fee; and

     the limitations on the ability of MessageMedia to negotiate with other
     companies regarding an alternative transaction and the potential effect
     these provisions would have on MessageMedia receiving alternative proposals
     that could be superior to the merger with DoubleClick.

    
The MessageMedia board of directors also considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including:

     the risk that, because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes
     in the market price of either DoubleClick common stock or MessageMedia
     common stock, the per share value of the

     consideration to be received by MessageMedia stockholders might be
     significantly less than the price per share implied by the exchange ratio
     immediately prior to the announcement of the merger;

     the risk that the merger might not be consummated;

     the potential loss of revenues and business opportunities by MessageMedia
     caused by the announcement of the merger;

     the possibility of management disruption associated with the merger and
     integrating the operations of the companies and the risk that, despite the
     efforts of the combined company, the services of key management and
     technical personnel of MessageMedia might not continue with the combined
     company;

     the risk that the benefits sought to be achieved by the merger will not be
     realized; and

     other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
     'Risk Factors.'

    
The MessageMedia board of directors did not quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors discussed above.
After carefully
evaluating these factors, both positive and negative, the MessageMedia board of
directors determined that the merger is in the best interests of MessageMedia
and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that MessageMedia stockholders
vote for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger.

    
In considering the recommendation of the MessageMedia board of directors
with respect to the amended merger agreement, MessageMedia stockholders should
be aware that MessageMedia's directors and officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of MessageMedia
stockholders generally.
Please see ' -- Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger.'

OPINION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S FINANCIAL
ADVISOR

    The MessageMedia board of directors retained Stephens Inc. to advise it
with respect to financial and strategic alternatives.
The management of
MessageMedia recommended Stephens to its board of directors after interviewing
three candidates to be its financial advisor.
Stephens was selected based on
its in-depth knowledge of the industry in which MessageMedia operates and
relationship with potential buyers.

    
Stephens delivered a written opinion, dated May 31, 2001, to the
MessageMedia board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject
to the qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by
disinterested MessageMedia stockholders in the merger was fair from a
financial point of view to them.
A 'disinterested stockholder' is a holder
of MessageMedia's common stock other than a director, officer or employee of
MessageMedia, or any holder of ten percent or more of the outstanding shares
of MessageMedia common stock (assuming the exercise of convertible securities
beneficially owned by the holder).

    
No limitations were imposed by MessageMedia's board of directors on Stephens
with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in
furnishing its opinion.
The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations
between the management of DoubleClick and MessageMedia.
Although Stephens did
assist the management of MessageMedia in these negotiations, it was not asked by
MessageMedia to propose or recommend, and did not propose or recommend, any
specific exchange ratio as the appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

    
The full text of the fairness opinion of Stephens, dated May 31, 2001, which
sets forth the assumptions made, general procedures followed, factors considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by Stephens in rendering its opinion,
is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference.
You should read this opinion in its entirety.

    
Stephens has consented to the use of its fairness opinion as an appendix to
this proxy statement/prospectus.
Stephens provided the fairness opinion to the
board of directors of MessageMedia for its information and the fairness opinion
is directed only to the fairness from a

financial point of view of the offer price and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of MessageMedia as to how any stockholder
should vote on the merger or any matter related thereto.
The summary of the
fairness opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the fairness opinion.

    
In arriving at the fairness opinion, Stephens:

     analyzed certain publicly available financial statements and reports
     regarding MessageMedia;

     analyzed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
     operating data (including financial projections for the year ended
     December 31, 2001)
concerning MessageMedia prepared by management of
     MessageMedia;

     analyzed, on a pro forma basis, the effect of the merger;

     reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for shares of common
     stock of MessageMedia and DoubleClick;

     compared the financial performance of MessageMedia and DoubleClick and the
     prices and trading activity of shares of common stock of MessageMedia and
     DoubleClick with that of certain other comparable publicly-traded companies
     and their securities;

     reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
     mergers that Stephens deemed to be relevant;

     reviewed the merger agreement and related documents;

     discussed with management of MessageMedia the operations of, and future
     business prospects for, MessageMedia and the anticipated financial
     consequences of the merger to MessageMedia;

     assisted in deliberations regarding the material terms of the merger and
     the negotiations with DoubleClick; and

     performed other analyses and investigations and took into account other
     matters that Stephens deemed appropriate.

    
In preparing the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or reviewed by it in
connection with its analysis of the merger and has further relied on the
assurances of management of MessageMedia that they are not aware of any facts
that would make this information inaccurate or misleading.
Stephens has not
assumed any responsibility for independently verifying this information and has
not undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities of MessageMedia or DoubleClick or been furnished with any evaluation
or appraisal, nor conducted a physical inspection of the properties or
facilities of MessageMedia or DoubleClick.
With respect to the financial
projections furnished to, or discussed with, Stephens by MessageMedia, Stephens
assumed that the financial projections were reasonably prepared and reflected
the best currently available estimates and judgment as to the expected future
financial performance of MessageMedia.
Stephens expressed no opinion as to these
financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

    
For purposes of rendering the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed, in all
respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of
each party to the merger agreement and all related documents and instruments
contained therein were true and correct, that each party to these documents
would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by
each party under these documents and that all conditions to the consummation of
the merger would be satisfied without waiver thereof.
Stephens assumed that in
the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals
(contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no restrictions, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modification, would be imposed that
would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

    
Stephens was not asked to consider, and the fairness opinion does not in any
manner address, the price at which MessageMedia or DoubleClick would trade
following either the announcement or consummation of the merger.
The fairness
opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they
existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of the opinion.

    
When Stephens delivered its written fairness opinion, it took into account
that the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock to be received in
exchange for each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock, plus the
amount of assumed debt of MessageMedia less the amount of assumed cash of
MessageMedia is approximately $42.4 million, representing 1.3x and 1.2x
MessageMedia's revenues for the calendar year 2000 and projected calendar
year 2001, respectively.

    
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Stephens in connection with the preparation of its fairness opinion dated May
31, 2001.

    
Stock Price History.
To provide contextual data and comparative market data,
Stephens examined the history of the trading prices for both MessageMedia common
stock and DoubleClick common stock for the one-year period ending May 25, 2001.

Stephens reviewed the daily closing prices of MessageMedia common stock and
compared the performance of the price of MessageMedia common stock to that of
the NASDAQ Composite Index and an index of the share prices of five selected
publicly traded companies that Stephens believed to be appropriate for
comparison to corresponding financial information and operating data of
MessageMedia, specifically, ClickAction, Inc., Digital Impact, Inc., DoubleClick
Inc., Engage Inc. and Kana Communications, Inc.
(collectively, the 'Public
Comparables').
Stephens also reviewed the daily closing prices of DoubleClick
common stock and compared the performance of the price of DoubleClick common
stock to that of the NASDAQ Composite Index and an index of the share prices of
six publicly traded comparable companies, specifically, AvenueA, Inc., Engage
Inc., L90 Inc., Mediaplex, 24/7 Media, Inc. and ValueClick, Inc.
This
information was presented solely to provide the board of directors of
MessageMedia with background information regarding the prices of MessageMedia
common stock and DoubleClick common stock over the periods indicated.

    
Publicly Traded Company Analysis.
Stephens analyzed certain publicly
available financial information, operating data and projected financial
performance (per research analyst estimates) of the Public Comparables.

Stephens' analysis yielded ratios of market value of common equity plus total
outstanding debt less total outstanding cash ('Enterprise Value') to the
calendar 2000 revenues ranging from 0.3x to 2.9x, with a median of 1.0x, and
Enterprise Value to projected calendar 2001 revenues ranging from 0.1x to 3.2x,
with a median of 0.6x.

    
Stephens derived a range of implied trading values of MessageMedia common
stock of $0.30 to $0.60 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to 2000 calendar
revenues, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0212 to .0424 and a range of
$0.25 to $0.51 per share based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to projected 2001
calendar revenues, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0177 to .0360.

    
Precedent Transaction Analysis.
Stephens analyzed the financial terms, to
the extent publicly available, of two transactions comparable to that of the
proposed DoubleClick and MessageMedia combination, which were announced since
December 26, 2000.
The selected transactions were Chordiant Software, Inc.'s
acquisition of Prime Response, Inc. and SEAT Pagine Gialle SpA's acquisition of
NetCreations, Inc.
(collectively, the 'Transaction Comparables').
Stephens'
analysis of the Transaction Comparables yielded ratios of Enterprise Value to
the latest twelve month ('LTM') revenues of 0.4x and 1.4x and Enterprise Value
to projected next twelve month ('NTM') revenues of 0.2x.

    
Stephens derived a range of implied value of MessageMedia common stock of
$0.22 to $0.88 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to LTM revenues, which
implies an exchange ratio range of .0155 to .0622, and a range of $0.10 to $0.65
per share based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to NTM revenues, which implies an
exchange ratio range of .0071 to .0459.

    
Offer Premium Analysis.
Stephens compared the offer prices, to the extent
publicly available, of transactions publicly announced from May 22, 2000 to
May 22, 2001, with a transaction size ranging from $25 million to $100 million
to the closing prices one-day, one-week and one-month prior to the announcement
of the respective transaction.
Stephens' analysis of the offer premiums yielded
a median range of 28% to 36%.
Stephens derived a range of implied value of
MessageMedia common stock of $.50 to $0.59 using an offer premium range of 20%
to 40%, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0353 to .0417.

    
The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses performed by Stephens but describes, in summary form, the principal
elements of the presentation

made by Stephens to the MessageMedia board of directors on May 30, 2001.
The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore,
such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
Each of the
analyses conducted by Stephens was carried out in order to provide a different
perspective on the transaction and to add to the total mix of information
available.
Stephens did not form a conclusion as to whether any individual
analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion as
to the fairness of the merger from a financial point of view.
Rather, in
reaching its conclusion, Stephens considered the results of the analyses in
light of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based on the analyses
taken as a whole.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized
above, Stephens has indicated to MessageMedia that it believes that
consideration of some of the analyses and factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete or inaccurate
view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion.
The analyses performed by
Stephens are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such
analyses.

    
Fees.
Stephens will receive a fee for its services to MessageMedia.
Pursuant
to a letter agreement between MessageMedia and Stephens, MessageMedia agreed to
pay Stephens, upon the rendering of a fairness opinion, a fee of $150,000 for
such services.
In addition, MessageMedia engaged Stephens as its financial
advisor in connection with the proposed transaction and has agreed, if the
merger is consummated, to pay Stephens additional compensation (reduced by the
$150,000 fee paid for the fairness opinion) for such services to be calculated
based on the transaction value of the proposed merger.
It is estimated that the
aggregate fee will be no more than $750,000.
Stephens will also be reimbursed
for its out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses for its
legal counsel up to $25,000 in the aggregate.
In addition, MessageMedia has
agreed to indemnify Stephens for certain liabilities related to or arising out
of the engagement.

    
As part of Stephens' investment banking business, it regularly issues
fairness opinions and is continually engaged in the valuation of companies and
their securities in connection with business reorganizations, private
placements, negotiated underwritings, mergers and acquisitions and valuations
for estate, corporate and other purposes.
In the ordinary course of business,
Stephens and its affiliates at any time may hold long or short positions and may
trade or otherwise effect transactions as principal or for the accounts of
customers, in debt or equity securities or options on securities of MessageMedia
and DoubleClick.


INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

    
In considering the recommendation of the MessageMedia board of directors,
MessageMedia stockholders should be aware that certain officers and directors of
MessageMedia have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition
to, those of MessageMedia stockholders generally.
The MessageMedia board was
aware of these potential conflicts and considered them.

    
As of [            ], 2001, the officers and directors of MessageMedia owned
stock options to purchase an aggregate of [5,408,417] shares of MessageMedia
common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $[14.875] to $[0.030] per share,
[3,584,154] of which were not vested.
If the merger is completed, all
[1,406,250] of the stock options unvested as of [         ], 2001 owned by
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer will automatically become
vested and exercisable.
The vesting schedules for the remaining unvested options
do not accelerate upon consummation of the merger because they will be assumed
by DoubleClick.
However, pursuant to change of control agreements recently
entered into between MessageMedia and certain of its other officers and key
employees, each such person would be entitled to 12 months of accelerated
vesting of the options to purchase shares of MessageMedia common stock owned
by such person if the merger closes and such person is involuntarily terminated
or voluntarily terminates his or her employment for a permitted reason within
one month before or 12 months after the closing of the merger.
The vesting of
the remaining [2,334,065] stock options held by these officers and key
employees unvested as of [         ], 2001 may be accelerated pursuant to
these change of control agreements.

    
MessageMedia officers have agreements, including the change of control
agreements described above, pursuant to which, if such officers are
involuntarily terminated or if they terminate their employment for a permitted
reason, such officers would receive benefits including severance payments.

    
MessageMedia may grant transaction bonuses to certain employees (including
MessageMedia officers) involved in effectuating the merger, in an amount not to
exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.

    
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer owes $200,000 to
MessageMedia, which amount the MessageMedia board of directors has agreed to
forgive if the merger is consummated.

    
Because the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock outstanding is
significantly larger than the number of shares of MessageMedia common stock
outstanding, affiliates of MessageMedia, including its officers and directors,
who receive shares of DoubleClick common stock in the merger may be allowed to
sell or transfer a greater number of shares in a single transaction than would
be possible prior to the merger pursuant to the volume restrictions of Rule 144
of the Securities Act.

    
The amended merger agreement provides that, from and after the effective
time, DoubleClick will indemnify and provide advancement of expenses to each
person who is or was a director or officer of MessageMedia or any of its
subsidiaries at or at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, to the
same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to the advancement of
expenses as of the date of the merger agreement by MessageMedia pursuant to
MessageMedia's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
of the merger agreement.
DoubleClick will also fulfill the obligations of
MessageMedia pursuant to any indemnification agreements between MessageMedia and
any of the indemnified parties in effect immediately prior to the date of the
merger agreement.
In addition, the amended merger agreement provides that for a
period of six years after the effective time, DoubleClick will pay up to 150% of
the $310,000 annual premium currently paid by MessageMedia to maintain
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering persons who are covered by
MessageMedia's directors' and officers' insurance policy.
See 'The Amended
Merger Agreement and Related Agreements -- Director and Officer Indemnification
and Insurance.'

REGULATORY MATTERS

    Currently, neither DoubleClick nor MessageMedia is required to file any
information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the amended merger agreement.

    
DoubleClick and MessageMedia are not aware of any other governmental
approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger other than
compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware.
Should any approval or
action be required, DoubleClick and MessageMedia currently plan to seek the
approval or take any necessary action.
Failure to obtain the approval or take
any necessary action is not anticipated to have a material effect on the merger.


FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

    Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, counsel to DoubleClick, and Cooley Godward,
counsel to MessageMedia, are of the opinion that the following discussion
accurately describes the material federal income tax considerations generally
applicable to MessageMedia stockholders in connection with the exchange of
shares of MessageMedia common stock for DoubleClick common stock pursuant to the
amended merger agreement.
This discussion is based on currently existing
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed United States
Treasury Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.

Any such change could alter the tax consequences to MessageMedia stockholders as
described herein.

    
MessageMedia stockholders should be aware that this discussion does not deal
with all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular
MessageMedia stockholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as
stockholders who:

     are financial institutions, dealers in securities, tax-exempt organizations
     or insurance companies;

     are foreign persons;

     hold MessageMedia common stock which constitutes qualified small business
     stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     do not hold their MessageMedia common stock as capital assets;

     acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase
     plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

     acquired their shares as part of an integrated investment such as a hedge,
     straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other risk reduction
     transaction.

    
In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the
merger (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with
the merger), including any transaction in which shares of MessageMedia common
stock are acquired or shares of DoubleClick common stock are disposed of, or the
tax consequences of the assumption by DoubleClick of MessageMedia stock options.

    
ACCORDINGLY, MESSAGEMEDIA STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING
THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

    
It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that DoubleClick and
MessageMedia receive the opinions of their respective counsel, Brobeck, Phleger
& Harrison and Cooley Godward, that the merger will constitute a
'reorganization' under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
These
opinions will be rendered on the basis of certain facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in the opinions, including representations
contained in certificates of officers of DoubleClick and MessageMedia.
These
opinions of counsel will neither bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts
nor preclude the Internal Revenue Service from successfully arguing a contrary
position in court.
No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal
Revenue Service as to the United States federal income tax consequences of the
merger.

    
If the merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, the merger will result in the following federal income
tax consequences to MessageMedia stockholders described above:

     a holder of MessageMedia common stock will not recognize gain or loss to
     the extent the holder receives DoubleClick common stock in exchange for
     their MessageMedia common stock (except to the extent of any cash received
     in lieu of fractional shares of DoubleClick common stock);

     a holder of MessageMedia common stock who receives cash in lieu of a
     fractional share of DoubleClick common stock will recognize capital gain or
     loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
     received and the holder's tax basis allocable to the fractional share;

     the aggregate tax basis of the DoubleClick common stock received in the
     merger by a MessageMedia stockholder will be the same as the aggregate tax
     basis of the MessageMedia common stock surrendered in exchange for that
     DoubleClick common stock reduced by any tax basis allocable to any
     fractional share interest for which cash is received; and

     the holding period of the DoubleClick common stock received in the merger
     by a MessageMedia stockholder will include the period during which the
     stockholder held the MessageMedia common stock surrendered in exchange for
     that DoubleClick common stock.

    
A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization status
of the merger would result in MessageMedia stockholders recognizing taxable gain
or loss with respect to each share of MessageMedia common stock surrendered
equal to the difference between each stockholder's basis in such share and the
fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the DoubleClick
common stock received in exchange therefor.
In such event, a stockholder's
aggregate basis in the DoubleClick common stock so received would equal such
fair market value and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would
begin the day after the merger.

    
There are other tax-related issues that you should be aware of such as:

     Reporting Requirements.
Each MessageMedia stockholder that receives
     DoubleClick common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement
     with his or her federal income tax return

     providing his or her basis in the MessageMedia stock surrendered and the
     fair market value of the DoubleClick common stock and any cash received in
     the merger and to retain permanent records of these-facts relating to the
     merger.

     
Backup Withholding.
Unless an exemption applies under applicable law and
     regulations, the exchange agent is required to withhold, and will withhold,
     31% of any cash payments to a MessageMedia stockholder in the merger unless
     the stockholder provides the appropriate form as described below.
     
Therefore, each MessageMedia stockholder should complete and sign the
     Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to be
     sent to each MessageMedia stockholder, so as to provide the information,
     including the stockholder's taxpayer identification number and
     certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless an applicable
     exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to DoubleClick and
     the exchange agent.


ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    DoubleClick will account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting, which means that DoubleClick will allocate the purchase price to the
fair value of net tangible assets acquired and to intangible assets, which
includes goodwill.
Based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price,
DoubleClick expects to allocate approximately 30% of the purchase price to the
fair value of net tangible assets acquired and approximately 70% to the fair
value of intangible assets, including goodwill to be amortized by DoubleClick
over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend
on the results of the fair value appraisals.
Under the tentative conclusions on
the transition and effective date provisions reached by the Finanicial
Accounting Standard Board in its Exposure Draft, Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets -- Accounting for Goodwill, goodwill acquired in transactions
completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized.
If this standard is adopted
as currently drafted, DoubleClick's operating results will not reflect any
goodwill amortization expense related to the merger, which is expected to be
completed during the third quarter of 2001.


NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

    Stockholders of MessageMedia are not entitled to exercise dissenters' or
appraisal rights as a result of the merger or to demand cash payment for their
shares under Delaware law.


DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    If the merger is completed, MessageMedia's common stock will be delisted
from The Nasdaq National Market, assuming MessageMedia's common stock is then
listed on such market, and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.


RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES

    The shares of DoubleClick common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of DoubleClick common
stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of DoubleClick or
MessageMedia under the Securities Act.
Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or
are under common control of DoubleClick or MessageMedia, as the case may be, and
may include some of the officers, directors or principal stockholders of
DoubleClick or MessageMedia.
Affiliates may not sell their shares of DoubleClick
common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to:

     an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
     resale of those shares;

     an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     another applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

    
DoubleClick's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of
DoubleClick common stock to be received by affiliates in the merger.


OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    DoubleClick is currently formulating its plan for the integration of
the operations and personnel of MessageMedia into DoubleClick's existing
business.
The current DoubleClick officers and directors will continue to
be the officers and directors of the combined company.

    
The stockholders of MessageMedia will become stockholders of DoubleClick and
their rights as stockholders will be governed by DoubleClick's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, DoubleClick's amended and
restated bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware.

              
THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS

    
The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, as amended by the amendment to the merger agreement, copies of which
are attached as Appendix A and Appendix A-1 to this proxy statement/prospectus
and incorporated herein by reference.
We urge you to read the amended merger
agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the merger.
In the
event of any discrepancy between the terms of the amended merger agreement or
other agreements and the following summary, the amended merger agreement and
other agreements will control.


THE MERGER

    MessageMedia will merge with and into DoubleClick, following the adoption of
the amended merger agreement by the MessageMedia stockholders, and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger.


EFFECTIVE TIME

    At the time of the closing of the merger, the parties will cause the merger
to become effective by filing a certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State.
DoubleClick and MessageMedia are working toward completing
the merger as soon as possible and expect to complete the merger during the
third quarter of 2001.


DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER

    The directors and officers of the combined company will be the current
directors and officers, respectively, of DoubleClick.


CONVERSION OF MESSAGEMEDIA SHARES IN THE MERGER

    At the effective time, each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock
will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.0436 of a share of
DoubleClick common stock.

    
The number of shares of DoubleClick common stock issuable in the merger will
be proportionately adjusted as appropriate for any stock split, stock dividend
or similar event with respect to MessageMedia common stock or DoubleClick common
stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the completion of
the merger.
The exchange ratio will also be proportionately adjusted if the
number of outstanding shares of MessageMedia common stock (calculated in
accordance with the treasury method under United States generally accepted
accounting principles) is greater than the number set forth in the merger
agreement, except as otherwise permitted in the amended merger agreement, in
order to provide to DoubleClick and MessageMedia the same economic effect as
contemplated by the amended merger agreement prior to such increase.


NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

    No fractional shares of DoubleClick common stock will be issued in
connection with the merger.
Instead you will receive an amount of cash, in lieu
of a fraction of a share of DoubleClick common stock, equal to the product of
such fraction (after taking into account all shares that you hold as of the
effective time of the merger) multiplied by the closing price of a share of
DoubleClick common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the business day
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, rounded to the nearest
whole cent.


MESSAGEMEDIA STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of MessageMedia common stock and each outstanding warrant to purchase
shares of MessageMedia common stock will be assumed by DoubleClick.
Each
MessageMedia stock option or warrant assumed by DoubleClick will

continue to have the same terms, and be subject to the same conditions, that
were applicable to the option or warrant immediately prior to the effective
time, except that:

     each MessageMedia stock option or warrant will be exercisable for shares of
     DoubleClick common stock, and the number of shares of DoubleClick common
     stock issuable upon exercise of any given option or warrant will be
     determined by multiplying the number of shares of MessageMedia common stock
     underlying such option or warrant by 0.0436, rounded down, if necessary, to
     the nearest whole share; and

     the per share exercise price of any given option or warrant will be
     determined by dividing the exercise price of the option or warrant
     immediately prior to the effective time by 0.0436, rounded up,
if
     necessary, to the nearest whole cent.

    
Adjustments with respect to any options that are 'incentive stock options'
(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) will be effected in a manner
consistent with the requirements of that code.


EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to MessageMedia's employee stock purchase plan will be
exercised to purchase MessageMedia common stock at the price per share and in
accordance with the terms set forth in the employee stock purchase plan, and
each share of MessageMedia common stock so purchased will be considered issued
and outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive 0.0436 of a
share of DoubleClick common stock.
The employee stock purchase plan will
terminate at the effective time of the merger and no further purchase rights
will be granted thereafter.


THE EXCHANGE AGENT

    As of the effective time, DoubleClick is required to deposit with American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company or another bank or trust company certificates
representing the shares of DoubleClick common stock to be exchanged for shares
of MessageMedia common stock and cash to be paid in lieu of issuing fractional
shares.


EXCHANGE OF MESSAGEMEDIA STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR DOUBLECLICK STOCK CERTIFICATES

    Promptly after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to
MessageMedia stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering MessageMedia stock certificates in exchange for DoubleClick stock
certificates (and cash in lieu of fractional shares).
MessageMedia stockholders
should not submit stock certificates for exchange until receipt of the letter of
transmittal and instructions.


DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES

    MessageMedia stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on DoubleClick common stock with a record date after the merger is
completed until surrender of MessageMedia stock certificates.


REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia each made a number of representations and
warranties in the merger agreement.

    
MessageMedia made representations about the following topics:

     MessageMedia's organization, qualification to do business and good standing
     and existence of subsidiaries;

     MessageMedia's certificate of incorporation and bylaws;

     MessageMedia's capitalization;

     MessageMedia's corporate power to enter into, and its authorization of, the
     merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

     the merger and the merger agreement's non-violation of the certificate of
     incorporation or bylaws of MessageMedia, laws or material agreements or
     permits of MessageMedia;

     required approvals of governmental authorities relating to the merger
     agreement;

     not being satisfied.

    
The agreements related to the conduct of MessageMedia's business contained
in the amended merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized.
We
urge you to carefully read the provision of the amended merger agreement
captioned 'Conduct of Business Pending the Closing.'

    
Each of MessageMedia and DoubleClick has also agreed to:

     notify the other promptly of certain events and changes, including changes
     that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
     either party, or to affect its ability to perform its obligations pursuant
     to the amended merger agreement;

     provide access at reasonable times to its offices, employees and books to
     the other party and to furnish such information as the other party may
     reasonably request; and

     perform certain other actions as set out in greater detail in the amended
     merger agreement.


NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS

    Until the amended merger agreement is terminated, MessageMedia has agreed
not to, directly or indirectly:

     solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
     or offer that constitutes or could lead to a company competing transaction;

     enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person
     in furtherance of such inquiries or obtain a company competing transaction;
     or

     agree to or endorse any company competing transaction, or authorize or
     permit any of its representatives to take any such action.

    
However, MessageMedia may comply with the securities laws with regard to a
tender or exchange offer not made in violation of these prohibitions or, if
presented with a company superior proposal, may provide information in
connection with and negotiate the company superior proposal in accordance with
the fiduciary duties of MessageMedia's board of directors.

    
Further, MessageMedia is required to notify DoubleClick orally and in
writing within 24 hours after any of MessageMedia's Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer or Senior Vice President, Corporate Development receives
any proposal or offer, or promptly after any inquiry or contact with any person
with respect thereto, regarding a company competing transaction, including the
identity of the person making the proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the
terms of the company competing transaction.
MessageMedia must keep DoubleClick
apprised, on a current basis, of the status of the company competing transaction
and of any modifications to the terms.
In addition, MessageMedia must notify
DoubleClick promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) orally and in writing if
at any time MessageMedia's board of directors determines that it believes such
proposal is a company superior proposal.
In connection with any potential
company competing transaction, prior to furnishing any information or entering
into any discussions or negotiations with any person making a proposal,
MessageMedia will provide to DoubleClick prompt oral and written notice (and in
any event within 24

hours) to the effect that MessageMedia is furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person and MessageMedia will keep
DoubleClick promptly informed of the status of the terms and conditions of any
such discussions or negotiations.
Prior to accepting a company competing
proposal, MessageMedia must provide DoubleClick with 24 hours' oral and written
notice of such intention.

    
MessageMedia has agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to a company
competing transaction and will not release any person from or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party.

    
A 'company competing transaction' is defined in the amended merger agreement
as any of the following involving MessageMedia (other than the merger):

     any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
     recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
     (other than, with respect to the termination fee payable in the event
     either MessageMedia or DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement
     because the merger has not been consummated before October 31, 2001 or the
     amended merger agreement and the merger failed to receive the requisite
     votes for approval at MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting, and
     within twelve months after such termination, MessageMedia enters into a
     definitive agreement relating to a company competing transaction or
     consummates a company competing transaction, if MessageMedia acquires
     another person and the shares of MessageMedia common stock issued to the
     equityholders of such other person constitute less than 50% of the capital
     stock of the successor company in such transaction);

     any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of
     the assets of MessageMedia and its subsidiaries in a single transaction or
     series of related transactions;

     any tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
     voting securities of MessageMedia or the filing of a registration statement
     under the Securities Act in connection therewith;

     any person having acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire
     beneficial ownership of, or any group having been formed which beneficially
     owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of
     the outstanding voting securities of MessageMedia;

     any solicitation in opposition to the approval of the amended merger
     agreement by the stockholders of MessageMedia; or

     any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
     foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

    
A 'company superior proposal' is defined in the amended merger agreement as
a company competing transaction that:

     MessageMedia's board of directors shall have concluded in good faith, after
     consultation with independent outside counsel of nationally recognized
     reputation, that taking such action is necessary to prevent MessageMedia's
     board of directors from violating its fiduciary duties;

     if any cash consideration is involved, shall not be subject to any
     financing contingency and with respect to which MessageMedia's board of
     directors shall have determined in the proper exercise of its fiduciary
     duties that the acquiring party is capable of consummating such company
     competing transaction on the terms proposed; and

     MessageMedia's board of directors shall have determined (based on the
     advice of MessageMedia's independent financial advisors of nationally
     recognized reputation) in the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties that
     such company competing transaction provides greater value to MessageMedia's
     stockholders than the merger (and MessageMedia's independent financial
     advisors opine in writing that such company competing transaction is
     superior from a financial point of view).

    
The agreements related to MessageMedia's non-solicitation of transactions
contained in the amended merger agreement are complicated and not easily
summarized.
We urge you to carefully read the provisions of the amended merger
agreement captioned 'No Solicitation of Transactions.'

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

    
The amended merger agreement provides that:

     DoubleClick will indemnify and hold harmless, and will provide advancement
     of expenses to, each person who is or was a director or officer of
     MessageMedia or any of its subsidiaries at or at any time prior to the
     effective time of the merger to the same extent such persons are
     indemnified or have the right to the advancement of expenses as of the date
     of the merger agreement by MessageMedia pursuant to MessageMedia's
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the
     merger agreement.
DoubleClick will also fulfill the obligations of
     MessageMedia pursuant to any indemnification agreements (including
     MessageMedia's certificate of incorporation and bylaws) between
     MessageMedia and any of the indemnified persons in effect immediately prior
     to the date of the merger agreement;

     in the event that DoubleClick or any of its successors or assigns
     consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
     continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
     merger, or transfers a material amount of its properties and assets to any
     person in a single transaction or a series of transactions, then and in
     each such case, DoubleClick will make or cause to be made proper provision
     so that the successors and assigns of DoubleClick assume the
     indemnification obligations described above for the benefit of the
     indemnified parties and have at least substantially equal financial ability
     as MessageMedia (immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
     contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus) to satisfy the obligations
     of the parties pursuant to the amended merger agreement as a condition to
     any such future merger, consolidation or transfer becoming effective; and

     for six years after the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will
     maintain in effect the directors' and officers' liability insurance
     policies maintained by MessageMedia.
DoubleClick is not required to pay
     premiums in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by
     MessageMedia for such coverage, which annual premium is $310,000.
If the
     premium for such coverage exceeds $465,000, DoubleClick will purchase a
     policy with the greatest coverage available for $465,000.


BENEFIT PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS

    After the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will honor and satisfy
all obligations and liabilities with respect to MessageMedia's benefit plans
other than its employee stock purchase plan.
However, DoubleClick will not be
required to continue any particular MessageMedia benefit plan after the
effective time and any MessageMedia benefit plan may be amended or terminated or
may be merged with any DoubleClick benefit plans in accordance with its terms
and applicable law so long as employees of MessageMedia who are employed by
DoubleClick are provided benefits and coverage that are the same or
substantially the same as that provided by DoubleClick to similarly situated
employees.
To the extent permitted under the law, each employee of MessageMedia
or its subsidiaries will be given credit for all service with MessageMedia or
its subsidiaries (or service credited by MessageMedia or its subsidiaries) under
all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
DoubleClick (other than sabbatical benefits, for which employees of MessageMedia
or its subsidiaries will not receive any such past service credit) in which they
participate or in which they become participants for purposes of eligibility and
vesting.
All benefits and service credits are subject to insurance carriers,
outsider providers or the like being able to provide the benefits on terms
reasonably acceptable to DoubleClick and there shall be no duplication of
benefits.
Furthermore, DoubleClick or any of its subsidiaries is entitled to
make any change required by law.

    
As requested by DoubleClick, MessageMedia will take all actions necessary
and appropriate to terminate any MessageMedia benefit plan that is a 401(k) plan
as of the last day of the payroll period

immediately preceding the closing date of the merger and will make no further
contribution to any 401(k) plan.

    
After the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will also honor in
accordance with their terms all existing employment, severance, consulting and
salary continuation agreements between MessageMedia or any of its subsidiaries
and any current or former executive officer or director of MessageMedia or any
of its subsidiaries, subject to any modifications to such agreements agreed to
by such executive officers or directors and DoubleClick.

merger and the related transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver by

     which address matters only as of a certain date, which shall be so true,

     complete and correct as of such certain date), except in each case for any
     failures to be true, complete and correct which do not, in the aggregate,
     have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia, provided that MessageMedia

     DoubleClick;

    The amended merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be
abandoned at any time before the completion of the merger, notwithstanding the

     injunction or decree preventing the consummation of the merger has been

             or indicating its inability to take a position, with respect to the
             acceptance of a company competing transaction involving a tender
             offer or exchange offer by its stockholders) within five business

     MessageMedia has breached any of its representations, warranties,
     covenants or agreements set forth in the amended merger agreement, or a
     representation or warranty of MessageMedia becomes untrue, incomplete or

     DoubleClick to close set forth in the amended merger agreement would not be
     satisfied, and MessageMedia fails to cure such breach within 20 days after
     receipt by MessageMedia of a written notice from DoubleClick of such

Furthermore, the amended merger agreement may be terminated by MessageMedia
if DoubleClick has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

warranty of DoubleClick becomes untrue, incomplete or incorrect, in either
case such that the conditions to the obligation of MessageMedia to close set
forth in the amended merger agreement would not be satisfied, and DoubleClick

     or warranty of MessageMedia becomes untrue, incomplete or incorrect, in
     either case such that the conditions to the obligation of DoubleClick to
     close set forth in the amended merger agreement would not be satisfied,
     and MessageMedia fails to cure such breach within 20 days after
     receipt by MessageMedia of a written notice from DoubleClick of such
     breach;

     DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement following the
     occurrence of any of the following events:

         --  the board of directors of MessageMedia withdraws, modifies or

            transaction by its stockholders (including by taking no position, or
            indicating its inability to take a position, with respect to the
            acceptance of a company competing transaction involving a tender
            offer or exchange offer by its stockholders) within five business

             foregoing actions;

     such termination, either there shall have been proposed or publicly
     announced (A) a company competing transaction or (B) within twelve months

be made that changes the amount or type of consideration into which MessageMedia

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    
The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements of
DoubleClick have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of:

     the assumed acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares of
     MesssageMedia in exchange for 2,992,373 shares of DoubleClick common stock
     and the assumption by DoubleClick of MessageMedia options and warrants
     which, under the merger, convert into options and warrants to acquire
     409,751 shares of DoubleClick common stock;

     the April 23, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares
     of FloNetwork Inc. in exchange for approximately $11.4 million in cash,
     2,770,943 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of FloNetwork options and warrants which, under the merger of
     those two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 430,152
     shares of DoubleClick common stock; and

     the February 2, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding
     shares of @plan.inc in exchange for approximately $39.1 million in cash,
     3,206,474 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of @plan options and warrants which, under the merger of those
     two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 1,213,614
     shares of DoubleClick common stock.

    
Pro forma amounts have been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the
historical consolidated financial information of DoubleClick, MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan.


ACQUISITION OF MESSAGEMEDIA

    The purchase price of MessageMedia has been estimated based on the average
market price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National
Market, for the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately
after, the announcement of the merger, plus the fair value of options and
warrants assumed, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model.
The estimated purchase price does not include the effect of direct
acquisition costs.
The final cost of the acquisition will be a different amount.

    
The excess of the estimated purchase price over the book value of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and assigned a useful life
of three years.
The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on the
results of fair value appraisals.
DoubleClick believes that the effect of the
ultimate allocation will not differ materially from that assumed in the
following unaudited pro forma financial data.

    
The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2000.
The unaudited
pro forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been prepared as if
the merger had occurred on March 31, 2001.
The pro forma adjustments are
described in the accompanying notes.


ACQUISITION OF FLONETWORK

    On April 23, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of FloNetwork, a
privately-held Canadian provider of email marketing technology services.
The
purchase price of FloNetwork has been calculated based on the average market
price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for
the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately after, the day
the number of shares and the amount of cash consideration due to FloNetwork
shareholders became fixed pursuant to the agreement under which FloNetwork was
acquired, plus the fair value of options and warrants assumed, which was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

    
The excess of the purchase price over the recorded amount of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years.
The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on
the results of fair value appraisals.
DoubleClick believes that, as a result of
these fair value appraisals, portions of the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of net tangible assets acquired may be allocated to purchased
technology and in-process research and

development.
Accordingly, to the extent that a portion of the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is assigned
to acquired in-process research and development and immediately expensed,
operating results may differ materially from those presented in the pro forma
statements.

    
The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the FloNetwork acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000.

The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been
prepared as if the acquisition had occurred on March 31, 2001.
The pro forma
adjustments are described in the accompanying notes.


ACQUISITION OF @PLAN

    On February 2, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of @plan, a
leading provider of online target market research planning systems.
The purchase
price of @plan has been determined based on the average market price of
DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for the day
immediately prior to and the day of the final determination of the number of
shares and the amount of cash consideration due to @plan shareholders pursuant
to the merger agreement under which @plan was acquired, plus the fair value of
options and warrants assumed, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years.

    
The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the @plan acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000.
No
pro forma balance sheet information has been provided as @plan's net assets are
reflected in the financial position of DoubleClick as of March 31, 2001.
The pro
forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes.


RECLASSIFICATIONS

    Certain assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of
MessageMedia and FloNetwork have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma condensed balance sheet.
Certain costs and other
deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma condensed statements of operations.

   (b) The average market price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The
       Nasdaq National Market for the day immediately prior to, the day of and
       the day immediately after, the announcement of the merger.

   
The adjustment to deferred compensation reflects the unearned compensation
   cost associated with the unvested options of MessageMedia assumed by
   DoubleClick.
Pursuant to the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board
   Interpretation 44, this unearned compensation cost is calculated as the
   intrinsic value of an assumed option multiplied by the ratio of the option's

                 CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

   remaining vesting period to its total vesting period.
This cost is then
   subsequently recognized over the award's remaining vesting period.

   
The book value of the net assets acquired reflects: (1) the forgiveness of a
   $200 thousand loan receivable from MessageMedia's President and Chief
   Executive Officer upon the consummation of the merger and (2) the elimination
   of MessageMedia's historical goodwill balance as the result of the purchase
   business combination.

    expense related to its acquisition of MessageMedia should this standard be
    adopted as currently drafted.

MessageMedia was originally incorporated in the state of Wyoming on
March 11, 1994, under the name of First Virtual Holdings Incorporated.

It was reincorporated in the state of Delaware on January 12, 1996.
From
inception through 1998, its revenues principally were derived from its
Internet payment system and related services.
In June 1998, MessageMedia
was recapitalized by SOFTBANK Corp. and affiliates through a series of
transactions resulting in their acquisition of 19.1 million shares of
MessageMedia common stock.
In July 1998, MessageMedia made a strategic
decision to focus exclusively on e-messaging and related services, leveraging
the expertise of its key technical personnel and its existing proprietary
technology from the Internet payment system, which was phased out.
In
December 1998, MessageMedia changed its name from First Virtual Holdings
Incorporated to MessageMedia, Inc. in connection with its acquisitions of
two e-messaging companies, Email Publishing, Inc., also known as Epub, and
Distributed Bits, L.L.C. also known as Dbits.
As a result of the acquisitions,
EPub and DBits became wholly owned subsidiaries of MessageMedia.
These
acquisitions enabled MessageMedia to expand its suite of e-messaging services.

In August 1999, MessageMedia acquired two additional e-messaging companies,
Revnet Systems, Inc., also known as Revnet, and Decisive Technology Corporation,
also known as Decisive, to further broaden its comprehensive suite of
e-messaging solutions and its customer base.
All of these acquisitions were
accounted for as purchase transactions.
A summary of these acquisitions follows:

     EPub was a leading provider of outsourced email message delivery services
     to businesses and organizations.
On December 9, 1998, MessageMedia acquired
     all of the common stock of Epub in exchange for 5,582,676 shares of
     MessageMedia common stock and assumed all of their options and warrants in
     exchange for approximately 417,324 additional shares of MessageMedia common
     stock.

     
Dbits was a development state company developing customer email management
     systems and solutions.
On December 11, 1998, MessageMedia acquired all
     equity interests in DBits in

     exchange for 1,305,320 shares of MessageMedia common stock and warrants to
     purchase an additional 500,000 shares of MessageMedia common stock.

     
Revnet was a leading developer and supplier of software solutions providing
     businesses and organizations with 'in-house' email message delivery
     capability.
Revnet also provided outsourced email message delivery
     services.
On August 9, 1999, MessageMedia acquired all of the common stock
     of Revnet in exchange for 3,262,120 shares of MessageMedia common stock and
     assumed all of their options and warrants in exchange for approximately
     681,675 additional shares of MessageMedia common stock.

     such as e-surveys.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

    Email marketing has its basis in traditional direct marketing principles.

For decades, direct marketers have used traditional mail to communicate with
their customers.
The purpose of the direct mail pieces was to give customers
promotional information, offers and incentives that would encourage them to
purchase particular products.
Direct marketers soon realized that email could be
used to supplant or enhance traditional methods.
Email can be used to
effectively interact with customers and for a variety of purposes other than
purchase incentives.

    
Permission-based Email can be a Highly Strategic Tool for Online Business.

Permission-based, or 'opt-in,' email is a highly reliable, cost-effective and
timely way for businesses to create a personal, two-way dialogue with their
customers.
The complexity and functionality of commercial email is changing
dramatically.
For example, email can be used for a variety of highly strategic
functions such as marketing, customer service and transaction confirmations.

Email functions can also be quickly customized or adapted to allow businesses to
target and shape their communications to meet the rapidly changing needs of
their customers.
As businesses and consumers grow more comfortable with
conducting commerce over the Internet, email volume associated with business
communication and e-commerce is expected to grow even more quickly.
As the cost
benefits and flexibility of email are more widely recognized, MessageMedia
expects businesses to more rapidly embrace email as a strategic tool for
building customer relationships and responding to large volumes of inbound email
communications.

    
Changing Business Environment and Need to Foster Customer Relationships.
The
dramatic growth of the Internet and the proliferation of email in the last five
years have changed the way businesses and customers interact.
Prior to the
advent of email, businesses relied primarily on in-person interaction and
physical proximity to the customer as well as techniques such as direct mail and
telemarketing to foster customer relationships.
Such methods, however, vary in
their degree of effectiveness and are often characterized by high costs and slow
response times.

    
Email marketing is effective, fast and inexpensive.
Response rates of 15% or
more are common and marketers receive immediate feedback from customers.
Email
marketing costs may be 90% less than traditional direct marketing costs.

Moreover, many companies use email as a strategic tool to drive Web site
traffic, facilitate transactions and test new offers.

    
As a result, businesses are increasingly in need of strategic applications
that enable them to expand their customer base, foster customer loyalty and
provide personalized, one-to-one communication.
According to a Yankee Group
research report (Internet Market Strategies, December 2000), 'The

forecast for related email marketing services will grow from approximately $100
million by the end of 2000 to almost $3 billion by the end of 2004.
This is a
compound growth rate of 140%.'

    
Complexity of E-messaging Supports Comprehensive Outsourced Services.
To
create strong and effective e-messaging programs, businesses will need a broad
range of technology and strategic expertise to adapt and implement effective
solutions in today's rapidly changing business and regulatory environment.

MessageMedia believes this will lead to an increase in the outsourcing of
e-messaging applications.
In order to effectively leverage e-messaging as a key
competitive tool, businesses not only must be able to gather information about
customer preferences and needs, but employ systems that are robust enough to
seamlessly and quickly respond to such data.

    
The implementation of effective e-messaging systems requires substantial
hardware, software and technical and administrative resources.
As email grows in
volume and sophistication, the resources and expertise required to
cost-effectively implement, enhance and scale e-messaging applications increases
exponentially.
Given the complexities of these strategic and technical problems
and the need to deploy a solution quickly and cost-effectively, businesses
increasingly are looking to outsource their e-messaging services to 'one-stop'
outsourced providers.
In general, as the level of complexity increases,
outsourcing becomes a more attractive option.

     requests in a personalized manner.

     
e-Survey -- MessageMedia provides its customers with a wide array of email
     based survey services.
These services range from the development of the
     permission profiling questions that may be asked in the permission center
     to periodic and on-going transaction surveys to measure customer
     satisfaction to surveys directed at a specific target audience, question or
     problem.

     
MessageMedia employs quantitative methods professionals with extensive
     experience in the design, development and deployment of surveys in both the
     conventional and e-survey delivery modes.
These professionals also have
     extensive data analysis and data modeling experience that is used by
     customers in the targeting and database segmentation aspects of their
     outbound e-messaging campaigns.

     
Database Services -- MessageMedia tracks and reviews the success of current
     and past e-messaging campaigns and can deliver multiple offers to
     separately defined customer groups.
This allows MessageMedia's customer to
     identify what worked and what did not and adaptively update and manage
     their campaigns in a proactive manner.
All messaging activity is
     automatically tracked and logged into MessageMedia's database, creating a
     clear history of all customer actions to aid in resolution of individual
     requests as well as total campaign analysis.
This detailed customer record
     provides a wealth of information and enables customers to fine-tune their
     direct marketing efforts and increase the return on investment in the next
     campaign.
Additionally, customers often bring other data from their legacy
     systems to their e-messaging database maintained by MessageMedia so that
     this additional data may be used to more effectively segment and target
     their customer communications.

COMPETITION

    MessageMedia's principal competitors are in the e-messaging services arena,
and MessageMedia may experience additional competition from Internet
service providers and other large established businesses that may enter the
market for e-messaging services.
MessageMedia competes for customers based on
service levels, product offerings and price.

    
Internet marketing companies, in general, and MessageMedia's e-messaging
solutions, in particular, also must compete for a share of advertisers' total
advertising budgets with traditional advertising media such as television,
radio, cable and print.
Consequently, MessageMedia competes with advertising and
direct marketing agencies.
To the extent that e-messaging is perceived to be a
limited or ineffective

advertising medium, companies may be reluctant to devote a significant portion
of their advertising budget to MessageMedia's e-messaging solutions, which could
limit the growth of e-messaging and negatively affect MessageMedia's business.

    
MessageMedia also expects that competition may increase as a result of
industry consolidation.
Potential competitors may choose to enter the market for
e-messaging solutions by acquiring one or more of MessageMedia's existing
competitors or by forming strategic alliances with such competitors.
In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the
ability of their products or services to address the needs of MessageMedia's
potential customers.
Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
Increased
competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of
market share, any of which would harm MessageMedia's business, results of
operations and financial condition.


SALES

    MessageMedia's sales efforts are currently conducted through a regionally
based, direct sales force.
MessageMedia's sales force typically markets its
solutions to the senior level marketing personnel and senior corporate
management within potential customer organizations.
MessageMedia has worked
with a number of 'blue chip' customers who have agreed to help facilitate
MessageMedia's sales efforts by acting as customer references.

    
MessageMedia maintains a separate group of regionally based sales
professionals that are responsible for selling its packaged software
applications, principally UnityMail.

    
MessageMedia's regionally based, direct sales force is focused on attracting
new customers.
MessageMedia's existing customers are supported by the account
management and customer services organization.
This group is responsible for
working with current customers on their communications and dialog programs, for
retaining these customers and for increasing the usage of MessageMedia's
services by these customers.
MessageMedia's account management and customer
services professionals are highly effective at managing relationships and
selling additional services to existing customers when the need arises.


RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING

    MessageMedia's research, development and engineering activities are focused
primarily on the design, development and enhancement of e-messaging services, as
well as on increasing the capacity and reliability of existing products and
services.
MessageMedia has devoted a significant portion of its resources to
research, development and engineering programs.
MessageMedia's research,
development and engineering expenses were $1.4 million for the three month
period ended March 31, 2001, and $6.2 million, $4.9 million and $4.8 million for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
MessageMedia
believes that significant research, development and engineering expenditures
will be required in order for it to remain competitive.
Accordingly,
MessageMedia expects that research, development and engineering expenses will
continue to constitute a significant portion of its overall expenses in the
future.

    
MessageMedia's ability to design, develop, test and support new software
products and enhancements on a timely basis is critical to MessageMedia's future
success.
There can be no assurance that MessageMedia will be successful in
developing and marketing new software products and enhancements that meet
changing customer needs and respond to such technological changes or evolving
industry standards.
MessageMedia's current services are designed around certain
widely used and accepted standards, including the MIME and SMTP email standards,
and integrate process-based security using email confirmation.
Current and
future use of MessageMedia's services will depend, in part, on industry
acceptance of such standards and practices as they apply to the Internet and
Internet commerce.


INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

    On March 13, 2000, MessageMedia entered into a definitive agreement with
@viso Limited, a strategic partnership between Vivendi and SOFTBANK Corp., to
create MessageMedia Europe, B.V., a

joint venture between MessageMedia and @viso.
MessageMedia owns 51% and @viso
owns 49% of the joint venture.
The initial capitalization of the joint venture
was funded with $14.8 million during the second quarter of 2000.
MessageMedia
Europe B.V. is consolidated into MessageMedia's financial statements.
On May 9,
2001, MessageMedia and @viso agreed to effect an orderly liquidation of the
joint venture.
Pursuant to that agreement, the parties released each other from
all claims, liabilities and demands relating to, among other things, the
formation and operation of the joint venture.
The initial capital to effect the
liquidation of the joint venture was provided by @viso, and MessageMedia issued
two promissory notes to @viso in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million.

Upon the closing of the merger, the notes will be immediately due and payable to
@viso.
Furthermore, upon the closing of the merger, a payment of up to $562,500
must be made to @viso as a change of control premium.
Upon the closing of the
merger, satisfaction of the two promissory notes and payment of the change of
control premium will become obligations of DoubleClick.
SOFTBANK Corp.
indirectly owns 50% of the interest in @viso and approximately 17% of the
outstanding common stock of MessageMedia.
SOFTBANK Corp. is not represented on
the MessageMedia board of directors.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION

    A number of states have adopted laws restricting the distribution of
unsolicited commercial emails, or Spam.
MessageMedia actively monitors such
legislation and regulatory development to minimize the risk of its participation
in activities that violate anti-Spam legislation.
Additionally, a number of
legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal and
state lawmakers and regulatory bodies and may be adopted with respect to the
Internet.
Some of the issues that such laws or regulations may cover include
user privacy, obscenity, fraud, pricing and characteristics and quality of
products and services.
The adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease
the growth of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the projected demand
for MessageMedia's products and services or increase its cost of doing business.

Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing U.S. and international
laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyright, trade secret,
libel, taxation and personal privacy is uncertain and developing.
Any new
legislation or regulation, or application or interpretation of existing laws,
could have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.


EMPLOYEES

    As of May 31, 2001, MessageMedia employed 205 employees, all of whom were
employed on a full time basis.
Of these 205 employees, 34 were in research,
development and engineering, 92 were in operations, 51 were in marketing and
sales and 28 were in administration.


PROPERTIES

    MessageMedia's corporate facilities consist of approximately 73,485 square
feet of leased space in Louisville, Colorado and 33,805 square feet in Superior,
Colorado.
The Louisville facility lease expires on October 14, 2010 and the
Superior facility lease expires on April 30, 2005.
MessageMedia leases space in
Denver, Colorado for its computer processing center.
In connection with the
December 1998 acquisition of EPub, MessageMedia acquired a facility lease
consisting of approximately 6,500 square feet of leased space in Boulder,
Colorado.
This facility lease expires on June 30, 2002.
Additionally,
MessageMedia leases facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, New York, New York,
Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF MESSAGEMEDIA

OVERVIEW

    MessageMedia is a leader in permission-based, email marketing and messaging
solutions.
MessageMedia uses advanced technology, tools and applications to help
its customers fully utilize the Internet to increase sales, improve customer
communications and develop long-term customer loyalty and customer dialogue.

    
MessageMedia's outsourced services provide customers with:

     a comprehensive set of e-messaging solutions for businesses that seek to
     increase sales, improve customer communications and develop long-term
     customer loyalty;

     permission-based e-messaging, which is a rapidly deployable, cost-effective
     outsourced solution to create an immediate two-way dialogue with customers;

     tools to track, review and refine e-messaging campaigns by leveraging
     MessageMedia's expertise and proprietary technology; and

     the ability to manage large volumes of simple or complex customer
     communications and easily integrate more advanced e-messaging and database
     applications.

    
MessageMedia's software solutions provide customers with:

     a complete solution for email marketing and email communications that
     integrates with relational databases such as Oracle or SQL Server;

     functions such as targeted email (filtering and data segmentation),
     personalized email, dynamic content editing and trackable URLs and campaign
     sequencing; and

     typical email list server functions such as reliable high throughput email
     delivery, bounce management, discussion lists, announcement lists and easy
     unsubscribes.

    
In December 1998, MessageMedia acquired Distributed Bits LLC, or DBits, and
Email Publishing Inc., or Epub.
DBits was a development stage company developing
customer email management systems and solutions and Epub was a leading provider
of outsourced email message delivery services.
In August 1999, MessageMedia
acquired Revnet Systems, Inc., or Revnet, and Decisive Technology Corporation,
or Decisive.
Revnet was a leading developer and supplier of software solutions
providing businesses and organizations with 'in-house' email message delivery
capability and outsourced email message delivery services.
Decisive was a
leading provider of online e-intelligence solutions such as surveys.

    
On March 13, 2000, MessageMedia entered into a definitive agreement with
@viso Limited, a strategic partnership between Vivendi and SOFTBANK Corp., to
create MessageMedia Europe B.V., a joint venture between MessageMedia and @viso.

MessageMedia owns 51% and @viso owns 49% of the joint venture.
The initial
capitalization of the joint venture was funded with $14.8 million during the
second quarter of 2000.
MessageMedia Europe B.V. is consolidated into
MessageMedia's financial statements.
On May 9, 2001, MessageMedia and @viso
agreed to effect an orderly liquidation of the joint venture.
Pursuant to that
agreement, the parties released each other from all claims, liabilities and
demands relating to, among other things, the formation and operation of the
joint venture.
The initial capital to effect the liquidation of the joint
venture was provided by @viso, and MessageMedia issued two promissory notes to
@viso in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million.
Upon the closing of the
merger, the notes will be immediately due and payable to @viso.
Furthermore,
upon the closing of the merger, a payment of up to $562,500 must be made to
@viso as a change of control premium.
Upon the closing of the merger,
satisfaction of the two promissory notes and payment of the change of
control premium will become obligations of DoubleClick.
SOFTBANK Corp.
indirectly owns 50% of the interest in @viso and approximately 17% of the
outstanding common stock of MessageMedia.
SOFTBANK Corp. is not represented on
the MessageMedia board of directors.

    
In the fourth quarter of 2000, MessageMedia recorded a charge of $7.0
million for restructuring.
An assessment of the adequacy of this restructuring
charge will be completed during the second quarter of 2001.
Any adjustment to
the reserve will be recorded in the second quarter of 2001.

    
MessageMedia has incurred net operating losses in each quarter since
inception.
As of March 31, 2001, MessageMedia had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $191.7 million.
There can be no assurance that MessageMedia's
future revenues will increase or not decrease.
In addition, since MessageMedia
expects to introduce new functionality of its services and explore opportunities
to merge with or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, MessageMedia
expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable
future.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND MARCH 31, 2001

    Revenues.
MessageMedia derives its revenues from outsourced services,
software products and related support services.
MessageMedia's outsourced
services include information distribution, email marketing and messaging
services.
MessageMedia's software products provide e-messaging capabilities for
customers desiring their own 'in-house' solution.
For the three months ended
March 31, 2001, revenues increased to approximately $8.7 million compared to
approximately $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000.
This
increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers
using MessageMedia's software products and services in the United States and an
increase in messaging and software services generated by MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    Cost of Revenues.
The cost of revenues for the messaging and software
service businesses consists of salaries, benefits, consulting fees and
operational costs related to providing MessageMedia's services and software.

    
For the three months ended March 31, 2001, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $3.8 million compared to approximately $2.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000.
This increase is primarily attributable to
increased headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base,
the related growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volume and the
incremental increase in cost of revenues as a result of the startup of
MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    Operating Expenses.
MessageMedia's operating expenses consist of marketing
and sales, research, development and engineering and general and administrative
expenses.
For the three months ended March 31, 2001, operating expenses
decreased to $8.1 million, compared to approximately $10.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000.
This decrease is primarily due to cost cutting
measures, including a reduction in labor force of approximately 125 employees
implemented in December 2000.

    
Marketing and sales expenses.
Marketing and sales expenses, which include
salaries, wages, consulting fees, advertising, trade shows, travel and other
marketing expenses, decreased to approximately $3.0 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2001, compared to approximately $5.5 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000.
This decrease is primarily due to a reassessment of
marketing needs and a corresponding reduction in marketing activities for the
fiscal year 2001.

    
Research, development and engineering expenses.
Research, development and
engineering expenses, which include salaries, wages and consulting fees to
support the development, enhancement and maintenance of MessageMedia's products
and services, increased to approximately $1.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2001, compared to approximately $1.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2000.
This increase is primarily due to expenses incurred in
relation to the ongoing engineering efforts related to the development of a more
robust messaging platform.

    
General and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, wages, professional and consulting fees, facility
costs and other expenses associated with the general management and
administration of MessageMedia.
General and administrative expenses increased to
approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared
to $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000.
This increase is
primarily due to additional facility

costs associated with the relocation of the corporate function and messaging
business unit within Colorado.

    EBITDA.
EBITDA is defined as loss from operations before depreciation and
amortization.
For the three months ended March 31, 2001, EBITDA loss decreased
to approximately ($3.3) million from ($6.2) million for the three months ended
March 31, 2000.
This decrease is primarily due to the effect of cost cutting
measures, including a reduction in labor force of approximately 125 employees,
implemented in December 2000.


YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND DECEMBER 31, 1998

    Revenues.
Prior to July 1998, MessageMedia derived its revenue from its
First Virtual Internet Payment System ('FVIPS') and related services.
In
August 1998, MessageMedia phased out the operations of the FVIPS and launched
its e-messaging services.
In December 1998, MessageMedia acquired DBits and
EPub, and in August 1999, MessageMedia acquired Revnet and Decisive.

------

    For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues increased to approximately
$33.6 million compared to approximately $10.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999.
This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the
number of customers using MessageMedia's products and services, increased
e-messaging volume, an incremental increase in revenue as a result of the
Decisive and Revnet acquisitions and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    
For the year ended December 31, 1999, revenues increased to approximately
$10.0 million compared to approximately $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998.
This increase is primarily due to the change in
MessageMedia's business strategy from an internet payment system product to
e-messaging and software products.
In August 1998, MessageMedia began its
e-messaging services, which is now its primary business, and phased out its
FVIPS operations.
The increase in revenue was also due to increases in the
number of customers using MessageMedia's services, increased e-messaging volume
and an incremental increase in revenue as a result of the EPub, Revnet and
Decisive acquisitions.

    
Cost of Revenues.
The cost of revenues for e-messaging solutions consists of
salaries, benefits, consulting fees and operational costs related to providing
MessageMedia's outsourced services.
Cost of revenues for software licenses
consists of software packaging and distribution costs.
The cost of revenues from
FVIPS consisted of fees paid to third parties for processing transactions, costs
of setting up new accounts and communication expenses related to providing
services from the FVIPS.
MessageMedia incurred cost of revenues from messaging
services, software products and FVIPS, as detailed in the table below:

    For the year ended December 31, 2000, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $17.3 million compared to approximately $4.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999.
This increase is primarily attributable to increased
headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base, the related
growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volume and the incremental

increase in cost of revenues as a result of the startup of MessageMedia Europe,
B.V. and the acquisitions of Decisive and Revnet.

    
For the year ended December 31, 1999, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $4.6 million compared to approximately $98,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998.
This increase is primarily attributable to increased
headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base, the related
growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volumes and the Decisive and
Revnet acquisitions.

    
Operating Expenses.
MessageMedia's operating expenses consists of marketing
and sales, research, development and engineering and general and administrative
expenses.
Overall operating expenses increased for the year ended December 31,
2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999 due to increased headcount and
related expenses and MessageMedia's startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V., which
began operations in March 2000.
Operating expenses increased for the year ended
December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 also due to
increased headcount and related expenses.
Additionally, MessageMedia's
acquisitions of EPub and DBits were completed in December 1998 and
MessageMedia's acquisitions of Revnet and Decisive were completed in August of
1999, therefore their operating results were not included in the comparable
period in 1998.

    
If the merger is not consummated, MessageMedia expects operating expenses to
continue to be substantial as development and enhancement of technological
capabilities associated with its e-messaging solutions and software services
continue, as it explores opportunities to merge with or acquire complementary
businesses or technologies and as it adds employees to service its growing
customer base.

    
Marketing and sales expenses.
Marketing and sales expenses, which include
salaries, wages, consulting fees, advertising, trade shows, travel and other
marketing expenses, increased to approximately $21.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to approximately $9.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999.
This increase is primarily due to growth in headcount in
sales, customer services and marketing staff as a result of increased sales
efforts related to MessageMedia's new e-messaging and e-intelligence solutions
and an incremental increase in headcount from the Decisive and Revnet
acquisitions and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V. Additionally,
advertising and promotional spending increased as a result of promoting
MessageMedia's new services and products in both the United States and Europe.

    
For the year ended December 31, 1999, marketing and sales expenses increased
to approximately $9.7 million compared to approximately $1.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998.
This increase is primarily due to growth in
domestic sales, customer services and marketing headcount, and increased
advertising and promotional spending.
Marketing and sales expense for the year
ended December 31, 1999 includes a one-time charge of approximately $855,000 in
compensation expense from acceleration of stock options.
This compensation
expense relates to an employment agreement with a former officer, which included
an option vesting acceleration clause that was triggered upon MessageMedia
obtaining certain sales contracts and/or certain sales levels.

    
Research, development and engineering expenses.
Research, development and
engineering expenses, which include salaries, wages and consulting fees to
support the development, enhancement and maintenance of MessageMedia's products
and services, increased to approximately $6.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to approximately $4.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999.
This increase is due to growth in headcount and related
compensation expense associated with MessageMedia's ongoing research,
development and engineering efforts.

    
For the year ended December 31, 1999, research, development and engineering
expenses increased to approximately $4.9 million, compared to approximately $4.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1998.
This increase is due to growth in
headcount and related compensation expense.

    
General and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, wages, professional and consulting fees and other
expenses associated with the general management and administration of
MessageMedia.
General and administrative expenses increased to approximately
$20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $7.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999.
This increase is primarily due to increases in
MessageMedia's

administrative staff and related compensation expense as a result of
MessageMedia's growth.
Additionally, there was an incremental increase in
headcount and related expenses due to MessageMedia's acquisitions of Revnet and
Decisive and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    General and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $4.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998.
This increase is primarily due to growth in headcount and
related compensation expense and general and administrative expenses associated
with the Revnet and Decisive acquisitions.

    
Restructuring charges.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, MessageMedia recorded
a charge of $7.0 million as a result of its decision to eliminate its e-services
line of business and reduce overhead by centralizing its Colorado offices to one
facility and reducing occupancy costs in its Chicago and San Francisco sales
offices.
The restructuring charge includes $2.0 million in facilities related
expenses, $1.1 million in e-services contract terminations, $1.5 million of
employee severance and related expenses and $2.4 million in asset impairment
charges for e-services software and costs related to closing MessageMedia's
facilities.

    
In the first quarter of 1999, MessageMedia recorded a charge of $1.0 million
as a result of its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from San
Diego, California to a new facility in Boulder, Colorado.
This decision was made
to create efficiencies in MessageMedia's e-messaging services operations, reduce
overhead by centralizing its offices to one facility and eliminate duplication
of efforts from similar positions in the separate offices.
The merger
integration and restructuring activity of MessageMedia, DBits and EPub included
a company-wide staff reduction, which resulted in approximately $632,000 of
employee severance pay and other related expenses and approximately $393,000 in
moving expenses and costs related to closing the San Diego facility.

    
In the second quarter of 1998, MessageMedia recorded a restructuring charge
of approximately $812,000 as a result of its decision to focus its efforts on
the messaging platform, initiate efforts to cease operations of its FVIPS and
better align its cost structure with expected revenue projections.
The
restructuring activity included the elimination of job responsibilities company
wide, resulting in approximately $545,000 of employee severance pay and other
related expenses and approximately $267,000 of expenses related to relocating
its corporate office and termination fees for cancellation of certain contracts
related to FVIPS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND MARCH 31, 2001

    At March 31, 2001, MessageMedia had $14.0 million in cash and cash
equivalents, including $4.5 million in restricted cash.
Of the $14.0 million,
$12.3 million was held by MessageMedia and $1.7 million by MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    On December 29, 2000, MessageMedia received a $3.0 million bank loan from
Wells Fargo and on February 22, 2001, MessageMedia raised $8.0 million in
funding from a private placement of MessageMedia's common stock to SOFTBANK
Venture Capital, Pequot Capital Management and Rebar LLC.
Historically,
MessageMedia has experienced recurring losses and has been unable to generate
sufficient working capital needed to meet its cash needs.
During 2000,
MessageMedia began restructuring its organization to reduce its expenditures on
infrastructure, including rent, salaries and other service expenses related to
its e-services division.
There can be no assurance that the restructuring

of its organization will achieve the desired results or that revenues will
increase to the level necessary to generate positive cash flow from operations.

However, MessageMedia believes that the additional capital raised through the
February 2001 private placement will be sufficient to allow it to maintain its
operations at least through December 31, 2001.
In addition, if MessageMedia is
unable to grow its revenues or obtain additional funding, it intends to further
limit expenditures in the areas of marketing, advertising, product development,
purchases of furniture and fixtures, salaries, bonuses and commissions.

    
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $8.9 million and
$8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.

Net operating cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2001 were
primarily attributable to net losses, increases in minority interest, settlement
of accounts payable and payment of restructuring charges offset by non-cash
charges for depreciation and amortization.
Net operating cash flows for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 were primarily attributable to net losses
offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, as well as
increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.

    
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $733,000 and $4.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.

Investing activities related to additions of furniture, computer equipment and
software.

    
Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $7.6 million and
$3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31,
2001 related primarily to proceeds from the February 22, 2001 private placement
of MessageMedia's common stock to SOFTBANK Venture Capital, Pequot Capital
Management and Rebar LLC.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 related primarily to proceeds received from
the exercise of stock options.


YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND DECEMBER 31, 1998

    
At December 31, 2000, MessageMedia had $15.8 million in cash and cash
equivalents, including $4.5 million in restricted cash.
Of the $15.8 million,
$11.1 million was in the United States and $4.7 million in MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $31.5 million, $19.0
million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
respectively.
Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2000 were
primarily attributable to net losses, and increases in minority interest and
accounts receivable, partially offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and
amortization, and increases in the restructuring reserve, accounts payable,
other accrued liabilities, and the write-off of furniture, equipment, and
software.
Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1999 resulted
from net losses, an increase in accounts receivable, and a decrease in other
accrued liabilities, offset by depreciation and amortization, and a decrease in
accrued compensation.
Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31,
1998 were primarily due to net losses offset by depreciation and amortization.

    
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $16.3 million, $1.7
million and $422,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Investing activities related to additions to furniture, computer
equipment and software.
For the year ended December 31, 1999, asset additions
were partially offset by cash acquired through the Revnet and Decisive
acquisitions.

    
Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $21.5 million,
$54.0 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2000 related primarily to proceeds from MessageMedia Europe, B.V.,
the exercise of stock options, and proceeds from the Wells Fargo bank loan.
The
net cash flow from financing activities in 1999 primarily resulted from proceeds
from issuance of common stock as a result of two separate private placements of
equity in March 1999 and October 1999, and proceeds from the exercise of stock
options.
Net cash flow from financing and activities in 1998 was primarily due
to proceeds from issuing common stock in a private placement and borrowings from
stockholders.

                       
COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia are both organized under the laws of the State

If the number of directors to be elected to the DoubleClick
board is increased and DoubleClick has not made a public announcement naming all
of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board at
least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's
annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than 30 days before or
60 days after such anniversary date, at least 70 days prior to such annual
meeting), a notice would be timely with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it is received by DoubleClick's Secretary
no later than 10 days following the day on which DoubleClick makes such public
announcement.
At a special meeting to elect directors to the board, a
stockholder who provides notice that is received by DoubleClick's Secretary
between 90 and 60 days before the date of the special meeting, or 90 days before
the date of the special meeting and 10 days after the date on which DoubleClick
makes a special announcement of the special meeting and the nominees proposed to
be elected.

    
The stockholder's written notice must include:

     the name and record address of the stockholder;

     the number of shares owned beneficially or of record by the stockholder;
     and

     a brief description of the business to be discussed and the reasons why it
     should be discussed at the annual meeting.

    
Although MessageMedia's amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
as amended, and bylaws are silent on the issue, under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, a stockholder wishing to bring business before the annual
stockholders' meeting must provide timely notice to MessageMedia's principal
executive offices not less than 120 days before the date that MessageMedia's
proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous
year's annual meeting.
However, if there was no meeting the previous year, or if
the date of this year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days
from the date of the previous year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable
time before MessageMedia begins to print and mail its proxy materials.
