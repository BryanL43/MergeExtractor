BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Historically, Solectron has been one of Centennial's more significant
customers.
For Centennial's fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and March 31,
1999, Centennial's sales to Solectron represented 8% and 10% of Centennial's
overall sales of PC cards and related products, respectively.
Centennial's sales
to Solectron increased to 17% and 12% of Centennial's sales of these products
for the three and nine months ended December 23, 2000, respectively.

Furthermore, as of December 23, 2000, accounts payable from Solectron to
Centennial amounted to approximately $1,555,000.
In December 1999, Solectron
merged with SMART, one of Centennial's competitors.
To date, Centennial has not
experienced a materially adverse reduction in sales to Solectron as a result of
the Solectron merger with SMART, although Centennial cannot be sure of any
future impact on its sales.

     
During the Spring of 2000, Centennial had preliminary discussions with a
variety of third parties with respect to potential strategic alternatives with
these parties.
None of these overtures advanced materially past preliminary
discussions and thus were not pursued by any of the relevant parties.

     
On June 7, 2000, the executive committee of the board of directors of
Centennial met and L. Michael Hone, the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Centennial, informed the executive committee of the existence of these overtures
and that all related discussions had been terminated, including one with a
particular third party, Company A.

     On June 30, 2000, a number of representatives of Company A, including the
Chief Executive Officer of Company A, met with Mr. Hone and Richard J. Pulsifer,
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Centennial, in Boston
to reinitiate preliminary discussions regarding the potential of engaging in a
business combination transaction.
At this meeting, the companies exchanged
business plans and limited financial forecasts and discussed the potential
synergies that could be achieved if the companies engaged in a business
combination.
At the conclusion of the meeting, representatives of Company A
indicated their need to review internally the materials exchanged and determine
if they would have further interest in a business combination.

     
Between July 1, 2000 and August 30, 2000, Mr. Hone and the CEO of Company A
periodically discussed a potential business combination between the two
companies.
In general, no specific terms were mentioned, although occasionally
they discussed financial information with respect to both companies and the
ability to consummate a business combination that could be accounted for as a
pooling of interests for accounting purposes.
It was generally understood that
Company A would indicate more clearly to Centennial if and when they developed a
serious interest in pursuing a business combination transaction.

     
In light of the discussions with Company A, the overtures in the Spring of
2000 and a determination by Centennial's management that the future success of
Centennial depended on either being acquired by another company or growing
through acquisitions of other businesses, with the input and approval of the
members of the Centennial board of directors, who were consulted individually,
Centennial engaged H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. on August 23, 2000 to serve as
financial advisor to the Company in

connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives, including a possible
sale of Centennial.
H.C.
Wainwright's specific responsibilities included advice
and assistance with respect to:

     - evaluating the business, operations and financial position of Centennial;

     - identifying, qualifying and facilitating discussions with potential
       parties to a significant corporate transaction;

     - structuring, planning and negotiating a significant corporate
       transaction; and

     - evaluating proposals received from potential parties to such a
       transaction.

     
Subsequent to this engagement and through the Fall of 2000, H.C.
Wainwright, on behalf of Centennial, contacted several other potential strategic
partners to determine whether such parties might have an interest in pursuing a
significant corporate transaction with Centennial.
During this period, H.C.
Wainwright contacted seven potential partners, including Company A and
Solectron.
Discussions with four of these partners, including Company A and
Solectron, advanced to the point of executing confidentiality agreements and
delivering and/or exchanging non-public information.
However, except for
developments with Company A and Solectron, no other negotiations advanced to a
material level, including the undertaking of due diligence or delivering of a
proposal for a transaction.
Throughout this period, the members of Centennial's
board of directors spoke frequently with Centennial's management and with
representatives of H.C. Wainwright as to the status of the various negotiations,
their input on the attractiveness of proposals and the progress of the processes
generally.
The board members approved of management's decisions and actions
during this period.

     
On August 30, 2000, Centennial received a term sheet from Company A,
subject to additional due diligence and negotiation, outlining tentative terms
of a proposed transaction to acquire Centennial in a stock for stock merger
valued, in the opinion of Centennial's management and members of Centennial's
board of directors, inadequately.
The proposal in the term sheet also
contemplated some members of Centennial's management entering into retention and
employment contracts.

     
On September 1, 2000, representatives of H.C. Wainwright discussed the
terms of the Company A proposal with the financial advisor representing Company
A and conveyed the opinion of Centennial's management that the offer was
inadequate to Centennial's stockholders.
At the conclusion of the meeting,
Company A's financial advisor indicated they would discuss the possibility of
increasing the offer with Company A utilizing additional updated financial
projections.
Centennial provided these projections to Company A approximately
one week after the meeting.

     
Between September 14, 2000 and September 19, 2000, several conversations
took place between H.C. Wainwright and the financial advisor to Company A.
These
conversations primarily focused on the inability of Company A to increase its
offer price to a level deemed to be adequate by Centennial.

     
In mid-September 2000, H.C. Wainwright, at the request of Mr. Hone,
contacted representatives of Solectron to determine if they had interest in
pursuing a business combination transaction.
Management of Centennial and
Solectron were generally familiar with each other as a result of business
relationships between Centennial and Solectron discussed above.
Following a
preliminary indication of interest from Solectron, on September 22, 2000
Centennial and Solectron entered into a confidentiality agreement to permit the
exchange of confidential information from Centennial to Solectron for the
purpose of evaluating the merits of a potential acquisition of Centennial by
Solectron.
Pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, Centennial thereafter
provided Solectron and its financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants
with confidential information concerning Centennial's business, operations and
financial condition.

     
On September 27, 2000, Mr. Hone, Mr. Pulsifer and representatives of H.C.
Wainwright met with representatives from Company A and their financial advisors
in Chicago to discuss the feasibility of a possible strategic transaction
between the companies.
At the meeting, the attendees discussed the business
operations of Centennial and Company A, potential synergies and their relative
customer bases.
At the conclusion of the meeting, Company A indicated a strong
interest in pursuing a business combination transaction with Centennial and
would be in contact with Centennial again in the near future.

     
At the end of September 2000, Mr. Hone spoke again with the CEO of Company
A, during which mutual interest in a business combination between Centennial and
Company A was reconfirmed, although no additional specific terms were proposed
or agreed upon.

     
On October 4, 2000, Centennial received a revised term sheet, subject to
additional due diligence, from Company A, outlining improved terms of their
proposal for a business combination transaction with Centennial.
Although the
revised proposal increased the number of shares of Company A stock that would be
issued in exchange for the acquisition of Centennial, the total consideration
was still deemed to be inadequate by Centennial.
The revised Company A proposal
also required that any transaction be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

     
At the request of representatives of Solectron, on October 9, 2000, Mr.
Pulsifer and a representative of H.C. Wainwright participated in a conference
call with Ajay Shah, Chief Executive Officer of the Technology Solutions
Business Unit (TSBU) of Solectron, Ann Nguyen, in-house legal counsel to TSBU,
Jack Pacheco, Chief Financial Officer of TSBU, Alan Marten, Vice President and
Business Unit Manager of the Memory Products Division of SMART, and Stephen
Coghlan, Director of Corporate Development for Solectron.
During the call,
Centennial's business and financial prospects and business models, and the
potential benefits of a business combination with Solectron, were discussed in
detail in order to provide Solectron with more information to facilitate their
determination of whether to move forward with the consideration of a business
combination transaction with Centennial.

     
On October 12, 2000, Ms. Nguyen and Mr. Coghlan met telephonically with
representatives of H.C. Wainwright to discuss potential valuation and
consideration amounts in connection with a possible offer to acquire Centennial.

Between October 13, 2000 through October 18, 2000, Ms. Nguyen and a
representative of H.C. Wainwright had several telephone conversations, during
which valuation ranges of $115 to $130 million were discussed and, based on
these discussions and the seriousness with which Solectron presented its
analysis, Centennial agreed to permit Solectron to perform limited, focused due
diligence in order to refine its range of valuations and consideration for
Centennial.

     
Between October 24 and October 26, 2000, representatives of Solectron met
with the management of Centennial and continued performing due diligence at
Centennial's headquarters outside of Boston and at the offices of Goodwin
Procter LLP, Centennial's legal counsel, in Boston.
At the conclusion of these
meetings, management of Solectron expressed a desire to continue to explore a
potential stock-for-stock acquisition of Centennial, but noted that it was
concerned about a perceived inability to retain key Centennial senior
management, a perceived lack of interest by other companies in Centennial and
that Centennial's growth had plateaued.

     
On November 1, 2000, Ms. Nguyen and Mr. Coghlan spoke by phone with
representatives of H.C. Wainwright.
They explained that based on their due
diligence review to date, Solectron was interested in pursuing a possible
acquisition of Centennial and had placed an overall value of Centennial in the
range of $105 million (assuming the transaction could be consummated using
pooling of interests accounting).
However, they indicated that Solectron's
interest was contingent upon the satisfactory completion of further business and
legal due diligence.
The parties did not reach any agreement at this time and
did not immediately continue discussions following the meeting.

     
Between November 1, 2000 and November 17, 2000, representatives of H.C.
Wainwright and Ms. Nguyen had several additional discussions regarding potential
terms of a business combination transaction and an appropriate valuation for
Centennial.
Also, during this period, representatives of Centennial and H.C.
Wainwright engaged in informal conversations with one of the two other companies
who had signed confidentiality agreements with Centennial.
No material
discussions or negotiations occurred with this third company, and no further
contact was made with them after the end of November 2000.

     
On November 17, 2000, Solectron indicated to H.C. Wainwright that Solectron
was prepared to negotiate the acquisition of Centennial assuming a valuation of
Centennial of $100 million, to be paid in Solectron common stock, with the
number of shares to be fixed at the closing of a transaction.

     
Separately, and also on November 17, 2000, the financial advisor for
Company A indicated to H.C. Wainwright that Company A was prepared to
significantly increase the consideration for Centennial's stockholders in their
proposal.
However, the amount of the increase could not be determined until
Company A's management had discussed the matter with its board of directors,
which was expected to occur shortly.

     
On November 21, 2000, pursuant to a series of telephone calls between Mr.
Hone and the CEO of Company A, Company A offered additional shares of Company A
common stock as consideration for the acquisition of Centennial.

     
On November 27, 2000, Mr. Hone and a representative of Company A had
additional conversations concerning obtaining a possible written proposal from
Company A.
On November 28, 2000, Company A sent Centennial a term sheet
outlining their latest proposal, which was substantially the same as their prior
proposals, except that it included the increased amount of consideration
contemplated by the foregoing discussions.

     
At a meeting of the executive committee of Centennial's board of directors
held on November 30, 2000, a representative of H.C. Wainwright updated the
executive committee on the status of Centennial's investigation of strategic
alternatives, including the discussions with Solectron and Company A.
At the
meeting, the executive committee and H.C. Wainwright concluded that based on the
relative valuations of the two proposals, the then-existing offer from Company A
was superior to the latest proposal received from Solectron.
It was also
discussed among the committee that Centennial's management believed that the
failure to progress further with Solectron was due in large part on the
inability to reach agreement on specific terms and provisions of an exclusivity
agreement between Solectron and Centennial, pursuant to which Centennial would
agree to negotiate exclusively with Solectron for a period of time.
The
Centennial executive committee also discussed generally the continuing process
to generate additional and higher offers, and the differences in the structure
of the two proposals.
Following these discussions, the Centennial executive
committee authorized Centennial's advisors to continue to negotiate with each of
Solectron and Company A, with a goal of eliciting the most attractive offer
possible.

     
On December 2, 2000, H.C. Wainwright received a revised proposal from
Solectron which indicated a reduced valuation from the November 17, 2000
proposal and which was also less attractive than the existing proposal from
Company A.

     On December 6, 2000, at the authorization of Mr. Hone, who had individually
conferred with the members of the executive committee, due to the inadequacy of
Solectron's offer and their inability to reach agreement on the terms of an
exclusivity agreement, H.C. Wainwright notified Ms. Nguyen that Centennial was
terminating discussions with Solectron.

     
On December 7, 2000, Mr. Shah telephoned Mr. Hone, reiterating Solectron's
continuing interest in pursuing a transaction with Centennial and that
representatives of the parties should meet.
Later on December 7, 2000, at a
meeting of Centennial's board of directors, Centennial's board discussed the
proposals from Company A and Solectron during which the board authorized
representatives of H.C. Wainwright and Mr. Pulsifer to continue to negotiate
with Solectron.
At this meeting, the board also discussed the apparent lack of
progress by Company A in moving forward with a potential acquisition of
Centennial.
Specifically, the board was concerned that the perceived absence of
commitment to a transaction by Company A's board of directors and Company A's
failure to conduct significant due diligence raised concerns as to whether
Company A was in fact intent on moving forward with an acquisition of
Centennial.
Following these discussions, the Centennial board of directors
authorized management to meet in person with Solectron concerning a potential
transaction, with the objective of obtaining a higher price and other favorable
terms.

     
On December 11, 2000, Mr. Pulsifer and a representative of H.C. Wainwright
met in Fremont, California, the headquarters of TSBU, with Mr. Shah, Mr.
Pacheco, Ms. Nguyen and Mr. Coghlan.
At this meeting, Solectron proposed
entering into a merger pursuant to which all the outstanding shares and
outstanding stock options of Centennial would be acquired or assumed in exchange
for 2.96 million shares of Solectron common stock.
Solectron also proposed that
the terms of any merger agreement would

otherwise be customary and typical for similar public companies, including the
provisions of indemnification for Centennial's directors and officers and the
continued viability of existing employment, severance and retention agreements.

This proposal, in the view of Centennial representatives, was more attractive
than the proposal received from Company A. Solectron indicated that continued
negotiation was contingent on the entering into of an exclusivity agreement by
the parties.
Centennial representatives indicated that entering into an
exclusivity agreement was dependent on Solectron providing a sample model of the
definitive merger agreement Solectron intended the companies to use and a list
of remaining due diligence issues.
The model agreement and diligence list were
delivered to Centennial prior to December 13, 2000.

     
On December 13, 2000, Centennial entered into an exclusivity agreement with
Solectron.
Pursuant to this agreement, Centennial agreed to cease all
acquisition negotiations with all other parties and to negotiate exclusively
with Solectron until January 19, 2001.

     
Later on December 13, 2000, H.C. Wainwright telephoned Company A's
financial advisor and informed it that Centennial had received a more attractive
offer and was ceasing all discussions with Company A.

     From December 14, 2000 through the middle of January 2001, members of
Solectron's management team and representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation, Solectron's legal counsel, and KPMG LLP,
Solectron's independent auditors, conducted business, financial, accounting, tax
and legal due diligence and participated in discussions with Centennial, its
legal counsel and its independent auditors on various issues.
Also during this
period, representatives of Solectron and Centennial met together with some of
Centennial's customers and facilitated the exchange of business, financial,
accounting and legal due diligence.

     
On December 19, 2000, Solectron's legal counsel forwarded an initial draft
of a merger agreement to Centennial, its legal counsel and H.C. Wainwright.

Centennial returned a revised merger agreement on December 22, 2000 and from
then until the middle of January 2001, numerous drafts of the merger agreement
were negotiated and exchanged.

     
On December 26, 2000, Centennial and H.C. Wainwright entered into a
separate engagement letter for H.C. Wainwright to serve as financial advisor
with respect to the acquisition of Centennial by Solectron.
In addition, H.C.
Wainwright agreed to assist the Centennial board of directors in analyzing the
terms of the proposed transaction between Centennial and Solectron to determine
whether the transaction would be fair, from a financial point of view, to
Centennial and its common stockholders, and, if requested, to render an
appropriate fairness opinion to Centennial's board of directors.

     
At various times during the final calendar quarter of 2000, members of
Solectron's board of directors, who also serve on an ad hoc mergers and
acquisitions committee, met telephonically with Susan S. Wang, Senior Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary of Solectron, and
other individuals representing Solectron in this matter, to discuss the merger,
due diligence findings and, ultimately, to authorize and approve the merger.

     
On January 11, 2001, Centennial's board of directors met to discuss the
progress of the due diligence and negotiations on the definitive agreement with
Solectron.
At this meeting, Messrs. Hone and Pulsifer, together with
Centennial's legal counsel, updated the board on the status of negotiations with
Solectron, including the key issues under discussion and the relative positions
of the parties with respect to such issues.
Centennial's legal counsel reviewed
for the board the terms of the merger agreement and the terms of the voting
agreements and indemnification agreements to be entered into by Centennial's
directors and executive officers.
In addition, H.C. Wainwright gave a
presentation of its financial analyses of the transaction terms, as currently
proposed, including a preliminary assessment of the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the range of exchange ratios then being discussed by
management of Centennial and Solectron, including the exchange ratio contained
in the then current draft of the merger agreement.
H.C.
Wainwright's analyses,
however, included a number of assumptions due to the various open issues
remaining.
These issues included the method for calculating the exchange ratio
for the Centennial common stock (and particularly the treatment of outstanding
Centennial stock options), the ability to treat

the merger as a pooling of interests, indemnification provisions, provisions
concerning treatment of existing Centennial employees and restrictive covenants
concerning Centennial's business during the period between signing of the merger
agreement and the completion or termination of the merger.
The Centennial board
of directors, after considering the terms of the merger agreement as discussed
at the meeting and the potential advantages and risks associated with the
merger, and after discussing and considering the analyses and presentation of
H.C. Wainwright, discussed with management acceptable parameters within which
the open issues under the merger agreement could be resolved to the board's
satisfaction.
On the condition that these open issues could be resolved within
the parameters deemed acceptable to the Centennial board of directors, the board
unanimously determined that the merger was advisable, in the best interests of
Centennial stockholders, and on terms that are fair to the stockholders of
Centennial.
Accordingly, the Centennial board of directors unanimously approved
the merger agreement and the merger and recommended that stockholders vote their
shares in favor of adopting and approving the merger agreement and approving the
merger, and further authorized management to complete negotiations of, and
execute, the merger agreement and other related agreements, assuming and on the
condition that the unresolved issues would be resolved within the parameters
established by the board.

     
Following the Centennial board meeting, members of Centennial and Solectron
management, together with their respective legal and financial advisors,
continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed merger, including the method
for calculating the exchange ratio for Centennial common stock, the
indemnification provisions, provisions concerning treatment of existing
Centennial employees, and the restrictive covenants concerning Centennial's
business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the
completion or termination of the merger.
The parties also further investigated
whether the merger could be accounted for as a pooling of interests, and
ultimately determined it could not.
Such negotiations continued throughout the
week, during which period Centennial continued to exchange certain non-public
due diligence information with Solectron.

     
On January 18, 2001, Centennial's board of directors met again to discuss
the final terms of the merger with Solectron.
At this meeting, Messrs. Hone and
Pulsifer, together with Centennial's legal counsel, updated the board on the
status of the final negotiations.
Centennial's legal counsel reviewed for the
board the changes to the terms of the merger agreement since the last board
meeting.
In addition, H.C. Wainwright updated its presentation to the board
concerning the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
set forth in the merger agreement to Centennial's common stockholders, which was
later confirmed in writing, and delivered its opinion that, as of that date, the
exchange ratio, as set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Centennial common stock.
The Centennial board
of directors considered the terms of the merger agreement, and the potential
advantages and risks associated with the merger, and after discussing and
considering the analyses and opinion of H.C. Wainwright, re-affirmed its
previous unanimous determination that the merger was advisable, in the best
interests of Centennial stockholders and on terms that are fair to the
stockholders of Centennial.
Accordingly, the Centennial board of directors
reaffirmed its previous approval of the merger agreement and its prior
recommendation that stockholders vote their shares in favor of adopting and
approving the merger agreement and approving the merger, and its prior
authorization to management to enter into the merger agreement and the other
related agreements.
These negotiations and preparation of final definitive
versions of the merger agreement and related agreements continued through the
evening of January 22, 2001 and the agreement was signed on the evening of
January 22, 2001.
Early in the morning of January 23, 2001, Centennial and
Solectron issued a joint press release publicly announcing the merger.


CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER BY CENTENNIAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  CENTENNIAL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Centennial's board of directors consulted with senior management and
Centennial's financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors,
including those set forth below, in reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to
recommend that Centennial's stockholders vote FOR adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger.

     
The following discussion of Centennial's reasons for the merger contains a
number of forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of
Centennial with respect to future events that may have an effect on its future
financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties.
Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the
results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Cautionary
statements that identify important factors that could cause or contribute to
differences in results and outcomes include those discussed or incorporated by
reference in the section entitled "Cautionary Statements Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements in this Document" beginning on page 15 of this
document, and the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17 of this
document.

     
Merger Consideration.
In addition to the analyses and presentations by
Centennial's financial advisor summarized in the section entitled "Opinion of
Centennial's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 44 of this document, the
Centennial board of directors looked at the premium represented by the
consideration to be offered to the holders of Centennial common stock in the
merger, based upon the same-day price of Solectron common stock compared to the
price of Centennial common stock of $16.75 on January 18, 2001 (a 30.9%
premium), $14.25 on January 11, 2001 (a 45.3% premium), and $12.94 on December
19, 2000 (a 31.5% premium).
Centennial's board of directors also considered the
ability of Centennial's stockholders to continue to participate in the growth of
the combined company since the consideration to be received by Centennial's
stockholders consists of shares of Solectron common stock.

     
Advice from Centennial's Financial Advisor.
Centennial's board of directors
considered the detailed presentations made by H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc.,
Centennial's financial advisor, with respect to the proposed consideration to be
offered to the holders of Centennial's common stock in the merger.
The
Centennial board also considered H.C. Wainwright & Co. Inc.'s oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of its
opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Centennial common stock.
The full
text of this opinion is attached to this document as Annex C.

     Review of Prospects in Remaining Independent.
Centennial's board of
directors considered Centennial's financial condition, results of operations and
business and earnings prospects if it were to remain an independent entity.

     
Effect on Employees and Facility.
The board of directors of Centennial
considered the possible effect of the merger on the current facility and
employees of Centennial.

     
Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement Relating to Alternative
Transactions.
In evaluating the adequacy of the consideration to be received,
the Centennial board of directors determined that the merger agreement did not
preclude a third party offer for Centennial.
In particular, in connection with
an acquisition proposal more favorable from a financial point of view than the
merger, subject to restrictions discussed more fully in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement and Related Transactions -- The Merger Agreement"
beginning on page 53 of this document, the merger agreement permits the
Centennial board of directors, if required by its fiduciary duties, to:

     - provide information to, and engage in discussion or negotiations with, a
       third party that makes an unsolicited proposal; and

     - withdraw its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of
       adopting and approving the merger agreement and approving the merger.

     
Centennial's board of directors also considered that the merger agreement:

     - permits Solectron to terminate the merger agreement if the board of
       directors withdraws its recommendation in favor of the merger with
       Solectron or recommends another proposal; and

     - requires Centennial to pay a termination fee to Solectron if the merger
       agreement is terminated under some circumstances.

     
The Centennial board of directors noted that the termination payment
provisions of the merger agreement could have the effect of discouraging
alternative proposals for a business combination between Centennial and a third
party.
However, the board of directors concluded that the amount of the fee that

Centennial may be obligated to pay, and the circumstances under which it may be
payable, are typical for transactions of this size and type, are not likely to
discourage any such proposals and were necessary to induce Solectron to enter
into the merger agreement.

     
Limited Closing Conditions.
The Centennial board of directors considered
the limited nature of the closing conditions included in the merger agreement,
including regulatory consents, and the likelihood that the merger agreement
would be approved by Centennial's stockholders.

     Realization of Liquidity.
The Centennial board of directors considered the
historical and continued relative illiquidity of Centennial's common stock.
The
Centennial board believes that some of this lack of liquidity is due to the
absence of listing of Centennial common stock on a major stock exchange or the
Nasdaq National Market until November 30, 2000.
In addition, in the board's
opinion, the absence of material market analyst coverage and relatively small
market capitalization of Centennial have also been factors contributing to the
relative illiquidity of Centennial's common stock.
By providing for the exchange
of Centennial common stock for Solectron common stock, the merger may enable
existing Centennial stockholders to experience the advantages of a more liquid
investment, as Solectron common stock has historically experienced much higher
trading volumes than Centennial common stock and is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

     
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
Centennial's board of directors, while not exhaustive, includes the material
factors considered by the board of directors.
In view of the variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, Centennial's board
of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors, and
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

  
RECOMMENDATION OF CENTENNIAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After careful consideration, Centennial's board of directors has
unanimously determined that the merger agreement is advisable, in the best
interests of Centennial stockholders, and on terms that are fair to the
stockholders of Centennial.
Accordingly, the Centennial board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, and RECOMMENDS THAT
CENTENNIAL STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER.

  
OPINION OF CENTENNIAL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     H.C. Wainwright & Co., Inc. has acted as financial advisor to Centennial in
connection with the merger.
As part of its engagement, H.C. Wainwright delivered
its oral opinion to Centennial's board of directors at that board's January 18,
2001 meeting that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to various
considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Centennial common stock.
H.C. Wainwright subsequently confirmed its opinion in
writing.

     
THE FULL TEXT OF H.C. WAINWRIGHT'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED JANUARY 18, 2001,
WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED
AND REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY H.C. WAINWRIGHT, IS ATTACHED TO THIS DOCUMENT AS ANNEX
C AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS DOCUMENT
BY REFERENCE.
CENTENNIAL STOCKHOLDERS
ARE URGED TO CAREFULLY READ THIS OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.
THE SUMMARY OF H.C.
WAINWRIGHT'S OPINION SET FORTH IN THIS DOCUMENT IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     
In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright, among other things:

     - reviewed and analyzed publicly available financial statements for
       Centennial and Solectron and financial information made available to it
       by Centennial's management;

     - analyzed internal financial statements, including financial projections
       and other financial and operating data prepared by Centennial's
       management;

     - discussed with Centennial's management, Centennial's past, current and
       future prospects;

     - compared selected financial and stock market information for Centennial
       and Solectron with similar information for selected companies whose
       securities are publicly traded;

     - reviewed the financial terms of selected recent business combinations
       which it deemed comparable in whole or in part;

     - reviewed the merger agreement; and

     - performed those other studies and analyses and considered those other
       factors as it deemed appropriate.

     
In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright assumed and relied upon,
without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information reviewed by it for the purposes of providing its
opinion, and did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of
that information.
H.C. Wainwright did not assume any responsibility for the
independent valuation and appraisal of any of Centennial's assets and
liabilities.
With respect to financial projections, H.C. Wainwright assumed that
they were reasonably prepared by Centennial's management on a basis reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of Centennial's future
financial performance.
H.C. Wainwright expresses no view as to those projections
or the assumptions on which they were based.
H.C. Wainwright's opinion was
necessarily based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed on the date of its opinion.

     
The projections furnished to H.C. Wainwright were prepared by Centennial's
management.
Centennial does not publicly disclose internal management
projections of the type provided to H.C. Wainwright in connection with H.C.
Wainwright's analysis of the merger, and those projections were not prepared
with a view toward public disclosure.
These projections were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the
control of management, including, without limitation, factors related to general
economic and competitive conditions.
Accordingly, actual results could vary
significantly from those set forth in those projections.

     
Set forth below is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by H.C. Wainwright in connection with its opinion and reviewed with
Centennial's board of directors on January 18, 2001.

     
Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies

     H.C. Wainwright compared selected financial information and commonly used
valuation measurements for Centennial to corresponding information and
measurements for a group of five publicly traded companies who met specified
selection criteria (the SELECTED COMPANIES).
Each of the Selected Companies was:

     - a manufacturer of memory and storage products;

     - whose products are manufactured primarily for the computer and
       communications industries; and

     - whose major customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

     
Based on these criteria, the Selected Companies were:

     - Dataram Corporation

     - Integrated Silicon Solution

     - M-Systems Flash Disk

     - Simple Technology, Inc.

     - White Electronic Designs

     H.C. Wainwright analyzed the relative performance and value of Centennial
by comparing selected publicly available financial data of Centennial with the
Selected Companies, including multiples of:

     - market price to fully diluted earnings per share for the preceding twelve
       months;

     - market price to book value as of the latest available financial data;

     - adjusted market value (defined as common equity market valuation plus
       total debt and preferred stock less cash and cash equivalents) as a
       multiple of the preceding twelve months revenue;

     - adjusted market value as a multiple of the preceding twelve months EBITDA
       (defined as pretax income plus interest expense, less interest income,
       plus depreciation and amortization, excluding non-operating income and
       expense); and

     - adjusted market value as a multiple of the preceding twelve months EBIT
       (defined as pretax income plus interest expense, less interest income,
       excluding non-operating income and expense).

     
To calculate the trading multiples, H.C. Wainwright used, for the Selected
Companies, publicly available historical financial information concerning
historical financial performance and earnings estimates reported by FactSet and
Bloomberg, and for Centennial, historical financial information and projections
provided by Centennial's management.
H.C. Wainwright calculated the ratio of
price per share to earnings for the preceding twelve months and book value as of
the latest available financial data, and the ratio of adjusted market value to
revenue, EBITDA and EBIT for the preceding twelve months, as set forth below:

* Excludes revenues from sales of electronic components, which Centennial
  considers non-recurring.

     Based on the multiples for the Selected Companies set forth in the table
above, and other customary valuation methodologies utilized by H.C. Wainwright,
H.C. Wainwright developed relevant multiple ranges for each of these valuation
methods described in the table.
Based on this information, H.C. Wainwright
estimated that the implied enterprise value for Centennial in the merger based
on this analysis was approximately between $102 million and $113 million.
This
compares to the transaction value of $110 million based on the closing price of
Solectron common stock on January 18, 2001.

     
None of the Selected Companies are identical to Centennial.
Accordingly,
H.C. Wainwright believes the analysis of publicly traded comparable companies is
not simply mathematical in nature.
Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in H.C. Wainwright's
opinion, concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the Selected Companies and other factors that could affect the public trading
value of the Selected Companies.

     
Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions

     H.C. Wainwright reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly
available, of seventeen proposed, pending or completed merger and acquisition
transactions since January 1, 1998, involving targets who were manufacturers of
storage and/or memory products for the computer and communications industries
(the STORAGE AND MEMORY PRODUCTS TRANSACTIONS) or manufacturers of printed
circuit board and other electronic connector products for the computer and
communication industries (the PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD TRANSACTIONS).

     H.C. Wainwright calculated for each of the Storage and Memory Products
Transactions and the Printed Circuit Board Transactions, the ratio of
transaction value (defined as equity value plus debt and preferred stock, less
cash and cash equivalents) to revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and net income for the
twelve month period prior to the announcement of the transaction and compared
them to the corresponding transaction value ratios for Centennial implied by the
merger (except in the case of net income, where H.C. Wainwright compared equity
value, which H.C. Wainwright considers to be the industry practice).
The
following tables summarize the results of these analyses:

Based on the multiples for the Storage and Memory Products Transactions set
forth in the table above, and other customary valuation methodologies utilized
by H.C. Wainwright, H.C. Wainwright estimated that the implied enterprise value
for Centennial in the merger based on this analysis was approximately between
$91 million and $104 million.
This compares to the transaction value of $110.2
million based on the closing price of Solectron common stock on January 18,
2001.

  considers non-recurring.

     
Based on the multiples for the Printed Circuit Board Transactions set forth
in the table above, and other customary valuation methodologies utilized by H.C.
Wainwright, H.C. Wainwright estimated that the implied enterprise value for
Centennial in the merger based on this analysis was approximately between $97
million and $108 million.
This compares to the transaction value of $110 million
based on the closing price of Solectron common stock on January 18, 2001.

     
Transaction Premium Analysis

     H.C. Wainwright also calculated for selected Storage and Memory Products
Transactions and Printed Circuit Board Transactions, the premiums or discounts
to the acquired companies' per share market price one day prior to the
announcement of the transaction, one week prior to the announcement of the
transaction and four weeks prior to the announcement of the transaction.
H.C.
Wainwright excluded from this analysis any transaction which involved the sale
of a division or unit or any transaction for which information was not
available.
The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the per share market price on and one week and four weeks,
  respectively, prior to January 18, 2001.

     
All multiples for these Storage and Memory Products Transactions and
Printed Circuit Board Transactions were based on public information available at
the time of announcement of that transaction, without taking into account
differing market and other conditions during the two-year period during which
these Storage and Memory Products Transactions and Printed Circuit Board
Transactions occurred.

     
Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
precedent transactions analyzed were so diverse, and due to the inherent
differences between Centennial's operations and financial condition and those of
the companies involved in these Storage and Memory Products Transactions and the
Printed Circuit Board Transactions, H.C. Wainwright believes that a comparable
transaction analysis is not simply mathematical in nature.
Rather, this analysis
involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in H.C.
Wainwright's opinion, concerning differences between the characteristics of
these prior transactions and the merger that could affect the value of the these
companies and businesses and Centennial.

     
Exchange Ratio Analysis

     H.C. Wainwright also reviewed the ratios of the closing prices of
Centennial common stock divided by the corresponding closing prices of Solectron
common stock over various periods during the twelve month period ending January
18, 2001.
H.C. Wainwright examined the premia represented by the exchange ratio
over the averages of these daily ratios over various periods.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     H.C. Wainwright performed a discounted cash flow analysis for Centennial.

H.C. Wainwright calculated the discounted cash flow value for Centennial as the
sum of the net present values of (i) the estimated future cash flow that
Centennial will generate for the years 2001 through 2006, plus (ii) Centennial's
value at the end of that period.
The estimated future cash flows were based on
the financial projections and growth rates for Centennial for the years 2001
through 2006, both provided by Centennial's management.
The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis.

  considers non-recurring.

     
Based on the multiples described in the table above, and other customary
valuation methodologies utilized by H.C. Wainwright, H.C. Wainwright estimated
that the implied enterprise value for Centennial in the merger based on this
analysis was approximately between $90 million and $101 million.
This compares
to the transaction value of $110 million based on the closing price of Solectron
common stock on January 18, 2001.

     
In arriving at its opinion, H.C. Wainwright performed a variety of
financial analyses, the material portions of which are summarized above.
The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by H.C. Wainwright or of H.C. Wainwright's presentation to
Centennial's board of directors.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, the opinion is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving
at its opinion,

H.C. Wainwright did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or
factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.
Accordingly, H.C.
Wainwright believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without
considering all of the analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of
the process underlying its analyses set forth in its opinion.

     
H.C. Wainwright's opinion does not imply any conclusion as to the likely
trading range for Solectron's common stock after the date of its opinion or when
issued to Centennial's stockholders in the merger.
In performing its analyses,
H.C. Wainwright made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Centennial and Solectron.
Any estimates
contained in those analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual past or
future results or values, which may be significantly more or less than those
estimates.
Actual values will depend upon several factors, including changes in
interest rates, market conditions, general economic conditions and other factors
that generally influence the price of securities.

     
The terms of the merger were determined through negotiations between
Centennial and Solectron and were approved by Centennial's board of directors.

Although H.C. Wainwright provided advice to Centennial during the course of
these negotiations, the decision to enter into the merger was solely that of
Centennial's board of directors.
As described above, the opinion and
presentation of H.C. Wainwright to Centennial's board of directors were only one
of a number of factors taken into consideration by Centennial's board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the
merger.
H.C.
Wainwright's opinion does not address the merits of the underlying
decision by Centennial to enter into the merger agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the
merger agreement and the merger.

     
Centennial selected H.C. Wainwright as its financial advisor in connection
with the merger based on H.C. Wainwright's qualifications, expertise, reputation
and experience in mergers and acquisitions.
Centennial originally retained H.C.
Wainwright pursuant to a letter agreement, dated August 23, 2000, as
supplemented by a separate letter agreement with respect to the merger, dated
December 26, 2000.
Centennial agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright a $50,000 retainer
in connection with its original retention.
Under the December 26, 2000 letter
agreement, Centennial agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright an additional financial
advisory fee of $150,000 in connection with H.C. Wainwright's rendering of its
opinion.
Centennial has also agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright a transaction fee
equal to between 1% and 2.5% of the aggregate consideration in the merger upon
consummation of the merger.
As of January 23, 2001, the date of the public
announcement of the merger, the transaction fee payable to H.C. Wainwright would
be approximately $2,990,000 based on the aggregate consideration.
As the value
of the aggregate consideration in the merger may be different at the time of the
merger, the transaction fee payable may be higher or lower than this amount.

     
Regardless of whether the merger is consummated, subject to the approval by
Centennial in certain instances, Centennial has agreed to reimburse H.C.
Wainwright for fees and disbursements of H.C. Wainwright's counsel and for H.C.
Wainwright's travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the merger.
Centennial has also agreed to indemnify H.C. Wainwright and certain
related persons to the full extent lawful against various liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws arising out of its engagement or
the merger.

     
H.C. Wainwright is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
experienced in providing advice in connection with merger and acquisitions and
related transactions.
In the ordinary course of its business, H.C. Wainwright
may effect transactions, for its own account or for the account of customers,
and hold at any time a long or short position in securities of Centennial or
Solectron.

  
INTERESTS OF CENTENNIAL'S DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     When you are considering the recommendation of Centennial's board of
directors with respect to approving the merger agreement and the merger, you
should be aware that some of the directors and

executive officers of Centennial have interests in the merger and participate in
arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to, those of Centennial
stockholders generally.
The Centennial board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, when it approved the merger
agreement and the merger.
These interests include the following:

     Accelerated Vesting of Options

     With limited exceptions, the vesting restrictions on all outstanding
options held by directors and executive officers to purchase Centennial stock
will accelerate, thereby causing such stock options to become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the closing of the merger.
The aggregate number
of shares of Centennial common stock issuable upon the exercise of unvested
options held by directors and executive officers as of January 22, 2001, the
date of the merger agreement, was 174,663 shares.
Pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement, all options to purchase Centennial common stock will be
assumed by Solectron in the merger and converted into options to purchase
Solectron common stock.
For further discussion about the treatment of Centennial
options in the merger, see the section entitled "-- The Merger
Agreement -- Treatment of Centennial Stock Options" on page 61 of this document.

     
Executive Employment, Severance and Retention Agreements

     On May 22, 2000, Centennial entered into an executive employment agreement
with L. Michael Hone, Centennial's President and Chief Executive Officer.
The
executive employment agreement continues through May 22, 2003, and provides that
it is to be automatically extended each year for additional one-year periods,
unless Centennial gives prior notice of non-renewal.
The executive employment
agreement provides that Mr. Hone could be entitled to severance benefits
following the merger.
If, following the merger, Mr. Hone's employment is
terminated for any reason, other than for disability or for cause, or if Mr.
Hone terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the executive
employment agreement), then Mr. Hone is entitled to a severance payment that
will be equal to the product of the sum of his current annual base salary and
most recent annual bonus from Centennial, multiplied by the remaining term of
the executive employment agreement.
The severance payment generally would be
made in the form of a lump sum cash payment.
In addition, Centennial would also
be obligated to provide Mr. Hone with all of the health and other insurance and
other benefits to which he was entitled under his executive employment agreement
for 36 months following his termination of employment.
In the event that the
severance payment would be subjected to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code, Centennial would be required to make a "gross up"
payment to Mr. Hone to enable him to pay the excise taxes and all other taxes
imposed on this gross-up payment.

     
On April 11, 2000, Centennial entered into executive severance agreements
with Richard N. Stathes (Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and
Marketing), Jacques Assour (Senior Vice President, Operations), Richard J.
Pulsifer (Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary) and Mary A.
Gallahan (Vice President of Administration and Human Resources).
Under each of
the executive severance agreements, Centennial will be obligated to pay the
covered executive officer a severance amount if Centennial, or its successor,
terminates the employment of the executive officer without cause or if such
executive officer terminates his or her employment for good reason.
Under the
executive severance agreement with Mr. Stathes, the severance amount will be
equal to eighteen months of his base salary.
Under the executive severance
agreement with Dr. Assour, the severance amount will be equal to fifteen months
of his base salary.
Under the executive severance agreements with Mr. Pulsifer
and Ms. Gallahan, the severance amount will be equal to twelve months of his or
her base salary.
The severance payments generally would be made either in the
form of a lump sum cash payment or in bi-weekly installments, at the discretion
of Centennial or its successor.
If it terminated a covered executive without
cause, Centennial, or its successor, would also be obligated to provide the
covered executive with all of the health and other insurance benefits to which
the covered executive was entitled at the time of his or her termination for a
period of time equal to the number of months of salary included in the severance
amount.

     
During 1999, Centennial entered into retention agreements with Mr. Hone,
Mr. Stathes, Dr. Assour, Mr. Pulsifer, Ms. Gallahan and John C. Nugent, Managing
Director of Centennial Technologies

International Limited.
The retention agreements continue through March 31, 2001
and provide that they are to be automatically extended each year for additional
one-year terms unless Centennial gives prior notice of termination.
The
retention agreements provide that the covered executive officer could be
entitled to certain severance benefits following the merger.
If, following the
merger, the executive officer's employment is terminated for any reason, other
than for disability or for cause, or if such executive officer terminates his or
her employment for good reason, then the executive officer is entitled to a
severance payment that will be equal to the sum of the executive officer's
highest annual base salary and highest annual bonus from Centennial during the
five-year period prior to the merger, multiplied by a factor of 2.5 (or 3.0 in
the case of Mr. Hone).
The severance payments generally would be made in the
form of a lump sum cash payment.
In addition, Centennial would also be obligated
to provide the covered executive with all of the health and other insurance
benefits to which the covered executive was entitled at the time of his or her
termination for 30 months following his or her termination of employment.
In the
event that any severance payments would be subjected to the excise tax imposed
by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Centennial would be required to
make "gross up" payments to the affected executives to enable them to pay the
excise taxes and all other taxes imposed on this gross-up payment.

     
Any payments to Mr. Stathes, Dr. Assour, Mr. Pulsifer, Ms. Gallahan or Mr.
Nugent under their retention agreements are in lieu of any payments to them
under their executive severance agreements.
Any payments to Mr. Hone under his
retention agreement are in addition to any payments to him under his executive
employment agreement.
In the event that the employment of the executive officers
is terminated immediately after the merger, it is estimated that, based on
specific assumptions, the severance payments payable under these agreements,
plus the value of the related benefits and vesting of unvested stock options,
would be approximately $5,940,000 to Mr. Hone, $1,524,186 to Mr. Stathes,
$1,197,385 to Dr. Assour, $889,329 to Mr. Pulsifer, $798,207 to Ms. Gallahan,
and $919,615 to Mr. Nugent.
Additionally, the gross-up payments are estimated to
be approximately $3,317,500 to Mr. Hone, $721,750 for Mr. Stathes, $558,807 for
Dr. Assour, $378,032 for Mr. Pulsifer, and $347,937 for Ms. Gallahan.

     
Indemnification and Directors and Officers Insurance

     Centennial officers and directors are entitled to continuing
indemnification against some liabilities by virtue of provisions contained in
Centennial's certificate of incorporation, by-laws and the merger agreement.

Unless required by applicable law, for a period of six years following the
completion of the merger, Solectron has agreed to cause Centennial's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to contain exculpation and indemnification
provisions that are at least as favorable to Centennial's current directors and
officers as were in effect on the date that the merger agreement was signed.
The
merger agreement also provides that Centennial may purchase either a new
directors' and officers' insurance policy or a "tail" under Centennial's
existing policy to provide the currently covered directors and officers of
Centennial with liability insurance coverage for six years following the
completion of the merger for actions and omissions prior to the completion of
the merger.
In addition, the merger agreement requires that Solectron honor the
existing indemnification agreements between Centennial and its directors and
officers.
On January 12, 2001, Centennial entered into indemnification
agreements with each of its directors and executive officers which provide the
covered directors and officers with indemnification rights, including the right
to be advanced payments for incurred expenses in some circumstances.
Centennial
believes that the terms of the indemnification agreements are generally
customary and in line with those indemnification provisions other similar public
companies provide to their directors and officers.


CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER BY SOLECTRON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Solectron board of directors approved the merger agreement and the
merger because it determined that the combined company would have the potential
to realize a stronger competitive position and improved long-term operating and
financial results.
In particular, the Solectron board of directors believes that
the merger will allow Solectron and Centennial the opportunity to:

     - provide existing and new customers a more complete range of products and
       services;

     - capitalize on the strength of some industries served by Centennial;

     - benefit from combining established customer and supplier relationships of
       both companies;

     - leverage manufacturing and production resources and PC card manufacturing
       technology; and

     - cross-sell products into each other's installed customer base.

     
The Solectron board of directors also believes that the merger will
contribute to the success of the combined companies because:

     - the merger offers the opportunity to better serve the demands of many
       customers who order small quantities of products, which segment of the
       business is often more profitable than serving few customers who order
       significant quantities of such products; and

     - the merger will further strengthen Solectron's pool of sales and
       engineering talent.

     
After taking into account these and other factors, the Solectron board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger were
in the best interests of Solectron and its stockholders and that Solectron
should enter into the merger agreement and complete the merger.


THE MERGER AGREEMENT

  STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centers will be merged with and
into Centennial, and Centennial will survive the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Solectron.

  COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger contained in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived.
The
merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the
State of Delaware.
Centennial and Solectron expect to file the certificate of
merger shortly following the special meeting of Centennial stockholders at which
the merger agreement and the merger will be considered and voted upon.

     
We are working toward satisfying these conditions and completing the merger
as quickly as possible.
We currently plan to complete the merger during the
second calendar quarter of 2001.
Because the merger is subject to governmental
and regulatory approvals and other conditions, some of which are beyond our
control, we cannot predict the exact timing.

  
CONVERSION OF CENTENNIAL SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK IN THE MERGER

     In connection with the acquisition of a flash memory card business of Intel
Corporation, Centennial issued 60,000 shares of series B convertible preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share.
The series B convertible preferred stock
converts at a ratio of 10 to 1 and has a liquidation preference value of $80.00
per preferred share.
The series B convertible preferred stock is not redeemable
and ranks senior to Centennial common stock and to all other classes or series
of equity securities of Centennial which by their terms do not rank senior to
Centennial's series A junior participating preferred stock.
The preferred stock
shares are entitled to a number of votes in any matter submitted to the
stockholders of Centennial equal to the number of shares of Centennial common
stock into which they are then convertible.

     
The holders of Centennial series B convertible preferred stock are entitled
to receive, when and if declared by the board of directors of Centennial,
dividends in the same amount per share as would be payable on the number of
shares of Centennial common stock into which the preferred stock is then
convertible, payable in preference and in priority to any payment of any cash
dividend on common stock or any other class of stock or series thereof.

     
As of -, 2001 the 60,000 shares of series B convertible preferred stock
represent 600,000 shares, or approximately 15.1% of Centennial's total voting
shares.

     
At the effective time of the merger, each such share of Centennial series B
convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
merger will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive $80.00 in cash (payable in U.S. currency in immediately

available funds) pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and Centennial's
certificate of designation of rights, preferences and terms of the series B
convertible preferred stock.

     
If all of the shares of series B convertible preferred stock were converted
prior to the merger, they could be converted into 600,000 shares of Centennial
common stock.
Alternatively, if all these shares remain outstanding at the time
of the merger, they would convert in to the right to receive an aggregate of
$4.8 million in cash from Solectron.

     
Neither Centennial nor Solectron can predict if the holder of the series B
convertible preferred stock will exercise the right to convert prior to the
effective time of the merger.
If the shares are converted into Centennial common
stock prior to the merger, such shares of Centennial common stock will be
treated as all other Centennial common stock shares outstanding and will be
entitled to have such shares converted into the right to receive that number of
Solectron common stock shares as determined pursuant to the merger agreement.

  
CONVERSION OF CENTENNIAL COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER

     At the effective time of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without
any action on the part of Solectron, Centers, Centennial or any of their
respective securityholders, each outstanding share of Centennial common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive a fixed
number of shares of Solectron common stock based on an exchange ratio to be
calculated at the completion of the merger.

     
Assuming that all of Centennial's series B convertible preferred stock is
converted into Centennial common stock prior to the merger, the exchange ratio
for Centennial common stock in the merger will be calculated by dividing
2,960,000 by the sum of all shares of Centennial common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (including the number of
shares of Centennial common stock issued upon the conversion of Centennial's
outstanding series B convertible preferred stock and shares of Centennial common
stock issued upon the exercise of all purchase rights outstanding under
Centennial's employee stock purchase plan and shares of Centennial common stock
issuable upon the exercise of Centennial stock options outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger).
In the event that all of
Centennial's outstanding series B convertible preferred stock is not converted
into Centennial common stock prior to the merger, the exchange ratio for the
merger will be calculated in the same manner except that the numerator in the
calculation of the exchange ratio will be 2,960,000 minus a quotient, the
numerator of which is the product of $80.00 times the number of shares of
Centennial's series B convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, and the denominator of which is the average
closing price of Solectron common stock during the five trading days prior to
the effective time of the merger, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

     
Based upon Centennial's capitalization on the date of this document and
assuming that all of Centennial's series B convertible preferred stock is
converted into Centennial common stock prior to the effective time of the
merger, the exchange ratio for the merger would be approximately 0.536.
Based
upon Centennial's capitalization on the date of this document, assuming that
none of Centennial's series B convertible preferred stock is converted into
Centennial common stock prior to the effective time of the merger, and further
assuming that the average closing price of Solectron common stock during the
five trading days prior to the effective time of the merger is equal to the
closing price of Solectron common stock on the date prior to the date of this
document (i.e., $29.50), the exchange ratio for the merger would be
approximately 0.569.
These examples are based upon assumptions that may or may
not be accurate at the effective time of the merger.
The actual exchange ratio
for Centennial common stock in the merger may differ from these examples.

     
The exchange ratio for the merger will also be adjusted to reflect the
effect of any forward stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Solectron
common stock or Centennial common stock), extraordinary cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like changes with respect to Solectron common stock or
Centennial common stock occurring prior to the effective time of the merger.

     
Each share of Centennial common stock held by Centennial, Solectron,
Centers or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Solectron
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and
extinguished.

  
FRACTIONAL SHARES

     No fractional shares of Solectron common stock will be issued in connection
with the merger.
In lieu of a fraction of a share of Solectron common stock each
holder of Centennial common stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Solectron common stock will receive an amount of cash,
without interest, and rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying
such fraction by the average closing price of a share of Solectron common stock
for the five most recent days that Solectron common stock has traded ending on
the trading day immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

  EXCHANGE OF CENTENNIAL STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR SOLECTRON STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Promptly after the effective time of the merger, if you are the holder of a
Centennial stock certificate EquiServe Trust, N.A., the exchange agent for the
merger, will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering your Centennial stock certificates in exchange for Solectron stock
certificates, cash in lieu of a fractional share of Solectron common stock and
any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which you are or may be
entitled, or in the case of a holder of Centennial's series B convertible
preferred stock, the $80.00 per share cash consideration payable in respect of
Centennial preferred stock.
When you deliver your Centennial stock certificates
to EquiServe Trust, N.A. along with any required documents, your Centennial
stock certificates will be canceled and, if you are a holder of Centennial
common stock, you will receive Solectron stock certificates representing the
number of full shares of Solectron common stock to which you are entitled under
the merger agreement, or if you are a holder of Centennial series B convertible
preferred stock, you will receive a check payable in the amount of the aggregate
cash consideration payable to you in connection with the merger.
If you are a
holder of Centennial common stock, you will also receive payment in cash,
without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Solectron common stock
which would have been otherwise issuable to you as a result of the merger, and
any dividends or other distributions to which you may be entitled.

     
YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT YOUR CENTENNIAL STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR EXCHANGE UNTIL
YOU RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT FOR THE MERGER.

     
You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Solectron common stock with a record date after the merger is completed until
you have surrendered your Centennial stock certificates in exchange for
Solectron stock certificates.
Promptly after your Solectron stock certificates
are issued, you will receive payment for any dividend or other distribution on
Solectron common stock with a record date after the merger and a payment date
prior to the date you surrender your Centennial stock certificates.

     
Solectron will only issue a Solectron stock certificate in a name other
than the name in which a surrendered Centennial stock certificate is registered
if you present the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect
the unrecorded transfer of ownership of the shares of Centennial common stock
formerly represented by such Centennial stock certificate, and show that you
paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

     
If your Centennial stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
you may be required to deliver an affidavit and a lost certificate bond as a
condition to receiving your Solectron stock certificate or the preferred cash
consideration, as applicable.

CENTENNIAL'S CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial agreed that, until the
earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement,
or unless Solectron consents in writing, Centennial will:

     - carry on its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course, in

  SOLECTRON'S CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Solectron agreed that, until the
earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement,
or unless Centennial consents in writing, Solectron will not engage in any

as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) Internal Revenue Code.

  
MATERIAL COVENANTS

     Solicitations by Centennial; Withdrawal of Recommendation by Centennial
     Board of Directors

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial agreed to cease, as of
the date of the merger agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any parties other than Solectron conducted prior to the
date of the merger agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

     
Under the terms of the merger agreement, an Acquisition Proposal is any
offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than an offer or
proposal from Solectron), and an Acquisition Transaction is any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than the merger) involving any of the
following:

     - the acquisition or purchase from Centennial by any person or group of
       more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
       Centennial or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
       any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
       outstanding voting securities of Centennial or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Centennial in which the stockholders of Centennial immediately
       preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in
       the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;

     - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
       transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
       disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Centennial; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of Centennial.

     
Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, under
the terms of the merger agreement Centennial further agreed that neither it nor
any of its subsidiaries will (nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any of their
investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or representatives to):

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
       announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;

     - subject to certain limited exceptions applicable upon receipt of a
       Superior Offer, as described below, participate in any discussions or
       negotiations regarding, or furnish non-public information with respect
       to, any Acquisition Proposal;

     - take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
       proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any
       Acquisition Proposal;

     - subject to certain limited exceptions applicable upon receipt of a
       Superior Offer, as described below, engage in discussions with any person
       with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;

     - subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a Superior Offer,
       as discussed below, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
       Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       Acquisition Transaction.

     
Any violation of any of the restrictions described in the preceding
paragraph by any officer or director of Centennial or any of its subsidiaries,
or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of
Centennial or any of its subsidiaries is deemed to be a breach of the relevant
restriction by Centennial.

     
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial has agreed to inform
Solectron, as promptly as practicable, of any request received by Centennial for
non-public information that Centennial reasonably believes would lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by
Centennial with respect to or which Centennial reasonably should believe would
lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or
group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
Centennial
further agreed to use reasonable efforts to keep Solectron informed in all
material respects of the status and details, including material amendments or
proposed amendments, of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

     
Centennial is expressly permitted, however, to furnish non-public
information regarding Centennial and its subsidiaries to, and to enter into a
confidentiality agreement with or discussions with, any person or group in
response to a Superior Offer submitted by the person or group, and not
withdrawn, if all of the following conditions are met:

     - neither Centennial nor any of its representatives, or subsidiaries has
       breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
       agreement described above;

     - the board of directors of Centennial concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required
       in order for the Centennial board of directors to comply with its
       fiduciary duties to Centennial's stockholders under applicable law;

     - at least three business days prior to furnishing any such information to,
       or entering into discussions or negotiations with, the person or group,
       Centennial gives Solectron written notice of the identity of such person
       or group and of Centennial's intention to furnish information to, or
       enter into discussion or negotiations with, such person or group, and
       Centennial receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
       agreement containing customary limitations on the use and

       disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished to
       such person or group by or on behalf of Centennial; and

     - contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to the
       person or group, Centennial furnishes the same non-public information to
       Solectron, to the extent such non-public information has not been
       previously furnished by Centennial to Solectron.

     
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a Superior Offer is an
unsolicited, bona fide, written offer from a third party to consummate any of
the following transactions on terms that the board of directors of Centennial
determines, in its reasonable judgment, based on the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be more favorable to the
Centennial stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms of the
merger:

     - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Centennial
       pursuant to which the stockholders of Centennial immediately preceding
       such transaction hold less than a majority of the equity interests in the
       surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender or
       exchange offer or issuance by the Company, directly or indirectly, of
       beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
       representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
       Centennial's capital stock; or

     - a sale or other disposition by Centennial of substantially all of its
       assets.

     
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Centennial board of directors
is permitted to withdraw, amend or modify its unanimous recommendation in favor
of the merger only if:

     - a Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn;

     - neither Centennial nor any of its representatives has breached the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement described above; and

     - the board of directors of Centennial concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with its outside counsel that, in light of the Superior
       Offer, the withdrawal, amendment or modification of its recommendation is
       required in order for the Centennial board of directors to comply with
       its fiduciary duties to Centennial's stockholders under applicable law.

     
Centennial must give Solectron at least 72 hours notice of the commencement
of the change to the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors, and
provide Solectron with the opportunity to meet with Centennial and its counsel.

In addition, under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial has agreed to
provide Solectron with at least 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as provided to the Centennial board of directors, but in no event less
than eight hours) of any meeting of the Centennial board of directors at which
the Centennial board of directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior
Offer.
Furthermore, Centennial has agreed to provide Solectron with at least
three business days prior written notice of a meeting of the Centennial board of
directors at which the Centennial board of directors is reasonably expected to
recommend a Superior Offer to Centennial's stockholders (together with a copy of
the definitive documentation relating to such Superior Offer).

     
Regardless of whether there has been a Superior Offer, and regardless of
whether the Centennial board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies its
unanimous recommendation in favor of the merger, Centennial is obligated, under
the terms of the merger agreement, to hold and convene the special meeting of
Centennial stockholders at which the merger agreement and the merger will be
considered and voted upon.

     
Employee Matters

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Solectron agreed that, after the
completion of the merger, it will:

     - provide Centennial employees who remain after the merger with the types
       and levels of benefits provided by Solectron to similarly situated
       employees of Solectron;

     - honor the existing terms of those employment, retention, termination,
       severance, change of control, post-employment and other compensation
       agreements, arrangements and plans specified in the merger agreement; and

     - not terminate any Centennial employees who have accepted employment with
       Solectron or any of its subsidiaries, other than for cause, within 60
       days following the completion of the merger.

     
Solectron further agreed that if any Centennial employee becomes a
participant in any Solectron employee benefit plan, the employee will be given
credit under the plan for all service with Centennial prior to the merger, and
prior to the time the employee becomes a participant in the plan, for purposes
of eligibility (including waiting periods), and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual (except vacation accrual), provided that such service credit will not
result in the duplication of benefits.

     
Other Covenants

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of Solectron and Centennial
have also agreed, prior to the effective time of the merger, except as
specifically permitted or contemplated by the merger agreement, to:

     - use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers
       and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries' respective
       agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
       connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
       merger agreement;

     - promptly notify the other of any breach in any material respect of any
       representation or warranty contained in, or failure to comply in any
       material respect with any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied

     - use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
       all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
       or advisable to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious
       manner practicable the merger and transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing such
       things, including:

       - taking all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions to the
         completion of the merger to be satisfied;

       - taking all actions or nonactions necessary to obtain any necessary
         waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations by or from any
         governmental entity or third party required and taking all reasonable
         steps to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by
         any governmental entity;

       - defending all lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging the
         merger agreement or the consummation of the merger; and

       - executing or delivering any additional instruments reasonably necessary
         to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     
The agreements related to the conduct of Centennial and Solectron prior to
the closing of the merger are complicated and not easily summarized.
You are
urged to carefully read Article V of the merger agreement entitled "Additional
Agreements.
"

  TREATMENT OF CENTENNIAL STOCK OPTIONS

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase
Centennial common stock, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by
Solectron and become an option to purchase that number of shares of Solectron
common stock equal to the number of shares of Centennial common stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Centennial stock option, multiplied by the exchange
ratio for the merger, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares.
The
per share exercise price of each such Centennial stock option will be adjusted
to an exercise price equal to the per share exercise price of such Centennial
stock option divided by the exchange ratio for the merger, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent.
All other terms of each Centennial stock option will be
unchanged by the merger.
As of -, 2001, options to purchase approximately
1,542,968 shares of Centennial common stock were outstanding in the aggregate
under the various Centennial stock option plans.

     
Solectron will file a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the
shares of Solectron common stock issuable upon the exercise of Centennial stock
options assumed by Solectron within 15 business days after the effective time of
the merger.

  TREATMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER CENTENNIAL
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial's employee stock
purchase plan will be terminated as of the effective time of the merger.

Outstanding purchase rights under the Centennial employee stock purchase plan
will be exercised on the business day immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, and each share of Centennial common stock purchased pursuant to such
exercise will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of
Solectron common stock equal to the exchange ratio for the merger.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms at any

approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Centennial's
stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of directors of
       Solectron and Centennial;

     - by Solectron or Centennial, if the merger is not completed before April
       30, 2001 (or June 30, 2001, in the event that the registration statement
       on Form S-4 is reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission),
       except that either party's right to terminate the merger agreement under
       this provision will not be available to any party whose action or failure
       to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
       merger to occur on or before such dates, and such action or failure to
       act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

     - by Solectron or Centennial, if any governmental authority has issued an
       order, or taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
       restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger and which is
       final and nonappealable;

     - by Solectron or Centennial, if Centennial's stockholders fail to adopt
       and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger at the Centennial
       special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of that meeting,
       except that either party's right to terminate the merger agreement under
       this provision is not available to Centennial where the failure to obtain
       stockholder approval was caused by Centennial's action or failure to act
       which constitutes a breach by Centennial of the merger agreement;

     - by Centennial, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement on the part of Solectron in the merger agreement, or if any of
       Solectron's representations or warranties are or become untrue such that
       the condition to Centennial's obligation to complete the merger relating
       to the continued accuracy of Solectron's representations and warranties
       would not be satisfied.
However, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable
       by Solectron through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts,
       and Solectron continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,
       Centennial may not terminate the merger agreement for 30 days after
       delivery of written notice to Solectron of the breach.
If the breach or
       inaccuracy is cured during those 30 days, or if Centennial shall
       otherwise be in material breach of the merger agreement, Centennial may
       not terminate the merger agreement under this provision;

     - by Solectron, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement on the part of Centennial set forth in the merger agreement, or
       if any of Centennial's representations or warranties are or become untrue
       such that the condition to Solectron's obligation to complete the merger
       relating to the continued accuracy of Centennial's representations and
       warranties would not be satisfied.
However, if the breach or inaccuracy
       is curable by Centennial through the exercise of its commercially
       reasonable efforts, and Centennial continues to exercise such
       commercially reasonable efforts, Solectron may not terminate the merger
       agreement for 30 days after delivery of written notice to Centennial of
       the breach.
If the breach or inaccuracy is cured during those 30 days, or
       if Solectron shall otherwise be in material breach of the merger
       agreement, Solectron may not terminate the merger agreement under this
       provision;

     - by Solectron, if Centennial has breached the provisions of the merger
       agreement that prohibit the solicitation of, and discussions and
       negotiations with respect to, Acquisition Proposals; or

     - by Solectron, if a Triggering Event shall have occurred.

     
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a TRIGGERING EVENT is deemed to
have occurred if:

     - Centennial's board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies in a manner
       adverse to Solectron, its unanimous recommendation in favor of the

       merger;

       Proposal;

       not send to its securityholders within 10 business days after such tender
       or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
       disclosing that Centennial recommends rejection of such tender or
       exchange offer.

  
PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial must pay Solectron a
termination fee of $4,825,000, within one business day after demand by
Solectron, if the merger agreement is terminated by Solectron upon the
occurrence of a Triggering Event or following a breach by Centennial of the
provisions of the merger agreement that prohibit the solicitation of, and
discussions and negotiations with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal.

     
Further, under the terms of the merger agreement, Centennial must pay to
Solectron a termination fee of $4,825,000 if the merger agreement is terminated
by Solectron or Centennial because the merger is not consummated by April 30,
2001 (or June 30, 2001, if the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this
document forms a part is reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission) or
because Centennial's stockholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement

inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is materially adverse to the business,
assets (including intangible assets), capitalization, financial condition or
results of operations of such entity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

However, under the terms of the merger agreement, none of the following will be
deemed to constitute a material adverse effect on any entity:

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect relating
       to the United States economy or United States financial markets in
       general;

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that
       results from changes affecting any of the industries in which such entity
       operates or conducts business and not specifically related to, or having
       a materially disproportionate effect (relative to most other industry
       participants) on, such entity; or

     - any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
       resulting from the return of specified Centennial's inventory to Hitachi,
       the write-off of Hitachi controllers on Centennial's financial
       statements, books and records, or the write down of Hitachi flash memory
       components to its fair market value in accordance with generally accepted
       accounting principles.

  
EXPENSES

     Except with respect to the termination fee described above, each party will
pay all fees and expenses it incurs in the merger, except that Solectron will
pay all fees and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of Centennial's
attorneys and accountants) incurred in connection with the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration statement on Form S-4 of
which this document forms a part and any antitrust filing fees, and Centennial

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     
In the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to Solectron, and Goodwin Procter LLP, counsel to
Centennial, the following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger generally applicable to Centennial stockholders.
This
discussion is based on existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
existing treasury regulations and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change.
Any such change, which may or may
not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to Solectron, Centennial or
Centennial stockholders as described herein.

     
We do not discuss all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances.
Factors that could
alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

     - if you are a dealer in securities;

     - if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Internal Revenue Code;

     - if you are a non-U.S. person or entity;

     - if you are a financial institution or insurance company;

     - if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
       purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions;

     - if you hold Centennial common stock as part of an integrated investment,
       including a "straddle," comprised of shares of Centennial common stock
       and one or more other positions; or

     - if you hold Centennial common stock subject to the constructive sale
       provisions of Section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code.

     
This discussion assumes you hold your shares as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.

     
In addition, we do not discuss the tax consequences of the merger under
foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of transactions
effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the merger, whether or
not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the merger,
including without limitation any transaction in which Centennial shares are
acquired or shares of Solectron common stock are disposed of, or the tax
consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to acquire
Centennial common stock.
ACCORDINGLY, WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE
MERGER.

     
Completion of the merger is conditioned upon receipt by Solectron and
Centennial of opinions from their respective counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation, and Goodwin Procter LLP, that the merger will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code.
In the event that this opinion requirement is waived as a result
of a material change in the tax consequences of the merger from those expressed
in this tax consequences section, a revised tax consequences section will be
prepared and distributed to Centennial stockholders as part of a revised
document in connection with resoliciting stockholder approval for the merger.

     
The tax opinions contained herein and the tax opinions to be provided at
the completion of the merger will be rendered on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions,
including factual representations contained in certificates of officers of
Solectron and Centennial.
These tax opinions will also be based upon the
Internal Revenue Code, existing treasury regulations, and current administrative
rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect.

     
With respect to Centennial common stockholders, including a holder of
Centennial series B convertible preferred stock who converts its series B
convertible preferred stock into Centennial common stock prior to the effective
time of the merger, who hold their Centennial common stock as a capital asset,

qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Internal Revenue Code will result in the following federal income tax
consequences:

     - you will not recognize any gain or loss upon your receipt of Solectron
       common stock in the merger, except on cash received for a fractional
       share of Solectron common stock;

     - the aggregate tax basis of the Solectron common stock received by you in
       the merger, including any fractional share of Solectron common stock not
       actually received, will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the
       Centennial common stock surrendered in exchange therefor;

     - the holding period of the Solectron common stock received by you in the
       merger will include the period for which the Centennial common stock
       surrendered in exchange therefor was considered to be held;

     - cash payments received by you for a fractional share of Solectron common
       stock will be treated as if such fractional share had been issued in the
       merger and then redeemed by Solectron.
You will recognize gain or loss
       with respect to such cash payment, measured by the difference, if any,
       between the amount of cash received and the basis in such fractional
       share; and

     With respect to a holder of Centennial series B convertible preferred stock
(who does not convert to Centennial common stock prior to the effective time of
the merger), the merger will result in your recognition of taxable gain or loss
with respect to each share of Centennial series B convertible preferred stock
surrendered equal to the difference between your basis in such shares and the
$80.00 cash you receive with respect to such share.

     
Solectron, Centers and Centennial will not recognize gain or loss solely as
a result of the merger.

     
Neither Solectron nor Centennial will request a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service in connection with the merger.
The tax opinions do not bind the
Internal Revenue Service and do not prevent the Internal Revenue Service from
successfully asserting a contrary opinion.


ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     Solectron intends to account for the merger using the "purchase" method.


REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     
The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, under which a transaction cannot
be completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and the waiting periods expire or are terminated.
In addition, the merger may be
subject to various foreign antitrust laws, some of which may require us to make
filings with foreign antitrust authorities.
We have made the required filings
with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and received
early termination of the mandatory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act on February 13, 2001.
We intend to make required
foreign antitrust filings, and will not be permitted to complete the merger
until we have obtained all necessary approvals from foreign antitrust
authorities under all material applicable foreign antitrust laws.

     
However, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal
Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds after termination
of the mandatory waiting period.
Accordingly, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.
Other persons,
including any state or private person, could also take action under applicable
antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger.
There can be no
assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a
challenge is made, we will prevail.

     
Neither Solectron nor Centennial is aware of any other material
governmental or regulatory approval required for completion of the merger, other
than compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware.


RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SOLECTRON COMMON STOCK BY AFFILIATES OF CENTENNIAL

     
The shares of Solectron common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger have been registered under the Securities Act and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Solectron common
stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either
Solectron or Centennial.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control of either of Solectron or Centennial and may include some of our
officers and directors, as well as our principal stockholders.

not sell their shares of Solectron common stock acquired in connection with the
merger except pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     
Solectron's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this document
forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Solectron common stock to
be received by any person in the merger.


LISTING ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE OF SOLECTRON COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN
THE MERGER

     Solectron has agreed to cause the shares of Solectron common stock to be
issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange
before the completion of the merger, subject to official notice of issuance.


DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF CENTENNIAL
COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, Centennial common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act.


DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

     Under Delaware corporate law, holders of Centennial common stock and
holders of Solectron common stock are not entitled to dissenters' rights of
appraisal in connection with the merger because, on the record date, Centennial

In 1992, Centennial began to
design, manufacture and market cards that met the specifications agreed upon by
the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA).
These
cards have become universally known as PC cards.
Thereafter, Centennial
gradually de-emphasized and later ceased the marketing and sales of font
cartridges and began to focus on the growing PC card market for data storage.
In
1994, Centennial re-incorporated in Delaware.

     
On December 29, 1999 Centennial acquired the flash memory card business of
Intel Corporation which complimented and enhanced Centennial's current product
line.
The consideration for this transaction was approximately $2.0 million in
cash, a $4.0 million promissory note and 60,000 shares of series B convertible
preferred stock.
Through this transaction, Centennial acquired a variety of
Intel's PC card families, and related inventory, including the following lines:

     - Series 2;

     - Value Series 100 and 200; and

     - Miniature Card Families (Series 100 and 200).


INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

     In recent years, digital computing and processing have expanded beyond the
boundaries of desktop computer systems to include a broader array of electronic
systems.
Today, digital computing and processing can be found in many diverse
types of products such as:

     - mobile communication systems;

     - network switches;

     - medical devices;

     - navigation systems;

     - cellular telephones;

     - portable computers;

     - digital cameras; and

     - portable data collection terminals.

     
From a reliability and efficiency standpoint these products are better
served by PC cards than by traditional hard drive and floppy disk storage
solutions.
In particular, the following characteristics make PC cards better
suited:

     - high shock and vibration tolerance;

     - low power consumption; and

     - small size and high access speed.

     
PC cards are fully encapsulated to protect against environmental hazards
such as temperature variations and repetitive handling.

     
Centennial believes that demand for PC cards will continue to increase as a
result of:

     - more uniform and expanded adoption of PCMCIA standards by electronic
       equipment manufacturers;

     - the inclusion of PC card slots on next generation electronic devices; and

     - the development of PC cards offering new applications.

     
In addition, Centennial believes that the acceptance of portable computers
and the growing market surrounding hand-held computers and personal digital
assistants (PDAs), which use PC cards for storage and other applications, may
stimulate demand for Centennial's products.


BUSINESS STRATEGY

     
As an independent company, Centennial's goal is to become a leading
worldwide provider of PC card-based solutions to OEMs in the following
industries:

     - communications;

     - transportation;

     - mobile computing; and

     - medical and consumer OEM industries.

     
To reach this goal Centennial intends to:

     - Offer Comprehensive PC Card-Based Solutions.
Centennial offers an
       extensive PC card product line, which includes the following related
       value-added services:

      - in-house design expertise;

      - on-site technical and customer support;

      - flexible manufacturing, including the ability to make small production
        runs with minimum down time;

      - private packaging and labeling;

      - programming and testing capabilities;

      - rapid order turnaround; and

      - just-in-time delivery programs.

          
By offering comprehensive solutions for OEM PC card requirements, from
     design to shipment, Centennial has attempted to carve for itself a
     competitive advantage in the PC card market.

     - Focus on OEM Customers.
Centennial markets products and services to OEMs
       and value added resellers who sell products for applications within
       Centennial's target industries.
Centennial's intention is to achieve
       higher gross margins and customer loyalty by serving the OEM market
       rather than consumer markets.
Centennial believes these advantages exist
       due to the requirements for value-added services, such as design
       expertise, programming and prototype development.
In addition, Centennial
       believes that serving OEMs provides exposure to new technologies and
       emerging applications.
This, in turn, should enable Centennial to respond
       to technological advances and anticipate changes in market conditions.

     - Provide Flexible and High Quality Manufacturing Solutions.
As technology
       has changed, Centennial has upgraded and automated its manufacturing
       facilities to expand and enhance its in-house production capacity.
By
       manufacturing its own PC cards, Centennial can offer more flexible
       production schedules to its customers.
This is particular helpful as OEMs
       often require the delivery of a number of different products within a
       short time frame.
Centennial's PC card manufacturing facility in
       Wilmington, Massachusetts is ISO 9001 certified.
ISO 9001 certification
       is based on numerous aspects of Centennial's business, including
       manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, engineering and research.


CENTENNIAL PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENTS

     Centennial's PC cards may contain one or more of the following components:

     - memory chips, such as flash memory and static random access memory, for
       storage capacity;

     - input/output chips for transmitting and receiving data; and

     - memory chips with programmed software and other devices used in
       applications such as sewing machines and telecommunications equipment.

     
Centennial typically works with OEMs to design application-specific PC
cards.
This allows Centennial to develop and design PC cards for specific
industries or commercial application.
The following are some of the applications
in which Centennial's PC cards are used:

        INDUSTRY                                  APPLICATIONS
        --------                                  ------------

Communications..........  
Centennial's products are used for storage in certain
                          wireless telephone base stations, network routers and
                          switches.

Transportation..........  
Centennial's products are used in navigation systems, such
                          as Global Positioning Satellite equipment used in rental
                          cars and fleets of vehicles operated by corporations,
                          emergency and rescue vehicles, airplanes, ships and military
                          vehicles.
These systems interpret signals from a dedicated
                          network of satellites that circle the Earth, providing data
                          on the position, direction, altitude and speed of an object.
                          
Centennial also develops PC cards used to interact with
                          on-board information systems embedded in air, marine and
                          land based vehicles.

Mobile Computing and
  Office Automation.....  
Centennial's products are used for supplemental data storage
                          in portable computing devices, such as laptop computers,
                          handheld computers, and personal digital assistance.
Office
                          automation products, such as laser printers, fax machines
                          and desktop computers also employ Centennial's products for
                          supplemental data storage.

Medical.................  
Centennial's products are used to store patient data from
                          medical monitoring and diagnostic equipment, including:
                          - blood gas analysis systems;
                          - defibrillators; and
                          - hand-held glucometers.

Consumer OEM............  Centennial's products are used by OEMs who design and sell
                          various consumer products, such as sewing machines and
                          digital cameras.
In these particular applications, PC cards
                          are used to store digital image and embroidery pattern
                          information.

     
Centennial also manufactures and provides other products that do not meet
the PCMCIA specifications, but which are based on flash memory technology.
Flash
memory devices do not require power to retain data, are re-programmable and are
extremely reliable.
Because of these advantages, flash memory solutions have
grown in popularity and become more prevalent in equipment requiring data

storage.
Centennial believes that other flash based products which it
manufactures provide Centennial's customers with flexible alternatives to
address data storage and processing requirements.
Examples of these flash memory
products include:

     - single in-line memory modules (SIMMs);

     - dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs);

     - small form factor flash cards;

      - miniature cards;

      - compact flash cards; and

     - custom modules.

     
Single in-line flash memory modules and dual in-line flash memory modules
are types of compact circuit board assemblies consisting of flash memory devices
and related circuitry.
Electronic systems increasingly employ these types of
memory modules as building blocks in system design.
These allow OEMs to
configure a system with a variety of different levels of memory, which enable
OEMs to price their products progressively through a number of price-points or
develop applications with a single module that can be easily upgraded.

     
Small form factor flash cards are removable flash memory modules that fit
into small electronic devices.
For example, these cards can be used in compact
digital cameras.
These cards are similar to PC cards because they are made with
existing flash memory technology with modified mechanical packaging and
electrical connections.
Specific types of small form factor flash cards that are
offered by Centennial include:

     - The CompactFlash(TM) (a trademark of SanDisk Corporation) is based on the
       standard endorsed by the CompactFlash Association, an industry
       organization established to promote uniform standards for compact flash
       cards, of which Centennial is a member.
CompactFlash consists of a
       smaller housing than standard PC cards and uses internal technology which
       is able to save large amounts of data very quickly.

     -
The compact linear flash (CLF(TM)) card, is based upon a design promoted
       by Centennial.
The CLF(TM) card consists of the same size housing as the
       CompactFlash housing but is better suited for code storage applications.

     - The MiniatureCard(TM)
housing is smaller than the other CompactFlash
       products and uses a different form of connectors.

     - Custom modules are products created at the request of the OEM that fall
       within the parameters of our product line but are not part of our
       standard product offering.


SALES AND MARKETING

     Centennial targets industrial and commercial applications for PC cards
primarily in the communications, transportation, mobile computing, medical and
consumer OEM industries.
Centennial primarily markets its products through its
direct sales force, independent manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Additionally, Centennial utilizes the internet, industry publications and trade
shows in its marketing efforts.
Centennial's customer service staff operates
from its main office in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
Field sales representatives
conduct business from Centennial's main office, and remote offices, including
Centennial's sales office in Cheshire, England.
The sales to Centennial's OEM
customers are typically made pursuant to purchase orders.
Centennial's sales
staff and engineers will often work with OEM's to design and engineer PC cards
to the customer's requirements.
This often results in providing custom-designed
PC cards for specific applications.
Centennial believes interaction with these
customers provides exposure to emerging technologies in applications,
facilitating a proactive approach to product design.
The U.S. sales team reports
to the Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing.
The sales
force is compensated based on both salary and commission.

     
Centennial generally enters into individual purchase orders with its
customers.
Presently Centennial does not have any fixed long-term volume
commitments from any of its significant customers.
While in fiscal 1999, Nortel
Networks directly represented in excess of 10% of Centennial's sales, in fiscal
2000 no customer represented more than 10% of Centennial's sales.
However,
during fiscal 1999, Nortel Networks engaged several contract manufacturers to
complete the final assembly of a majority of its products for which Centennial
has historically supplied PC cards.
Nortel Networks, combined with these
contract manufacturers, represented 18% of Centennial's sales in fiscal 2000,
including revenues attributable to the flash memory card business acquired from
Intel.
For the nine months ended December 23, 2000, Solectron represented 12% of
Centennial's sales.


ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     Centennial's engineering and design efforts are directed towards products
for which it believes there is a growing and profitable market.
In particular,
Centennial seeks to meet the requirements of its target market OEM customers by
applying the latest available technology and the PC card design and engineering
know-how gained from Centennial's focus on its primary markets.
Centennial
provides engineering and design support to many of its customers in order to
help integrate its products into OEM equipment.
OEMs often require PC cards for
new applications within Centennial's target markets.
Centennial has developed
and maintained a library of several hundred successful designs.
The library is
routinely used to leverage Centennial's ability to address new OEM business
opportunities in a timely fashion.
The extensive library of released designs
affords Centennial with a broad array of solutions for its customers including
addressing new product requirements with a preexisting design.
Maintaining an
extensive line of card and module product designs allows Centennial to send
samples, including new OEM customer requirements, expeditiously.

     
All new designs are driven by our extensive knowledge of the OEM market,
flexibility, design for manufacture and reliability.
These factors, coupled with
utilizing high engineering practices, enable Centennial to react quickly to
changing market conditions such as component allocation and obsolescence.


COMPETITION

     The market for PC cards and related products is intensely competitive.

Centennial's competitors include the following companies:

     - M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers Ltd.;

     - SanDisk Corporation;

     - Simple Technologies, Inc.;

     - SMART Modular Technologies, Inc.;

     - Viking Components, Inc.; and

     - White Electronic Designs Corporation.

     
Centennial also competes with electronic component manufacturers who
manufacture PC cards, including Hitachi Semiconductor, Inc., Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation and Sharp Electronics Corporation.
These competitors may have the
ability to manufacture products at lower cost than Centennial.
Centennial
believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
factors, including the following:

     - product quality and performance;

     - provision of competitive design capabilities;

     - timing of new product introductions by Centennial, its customers and
       competitors;

     - order turnaround;

     - timely response to advances technology;

     - production efficiency;

     - general market and economic conditions;

     - ability to obtain raw materials;

     - number and nature of Centennial's competitors in a given market; and

     - price.


RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCT COMPONENTS

     Centennial purchases some key components from sources that are the only
supplier of that component.
Furthermore, a customer may require a component that
can only be produced by one vendor.
Centennial does not maintain long-term
supply agreements with its vendors.
The inability to develop alternative sources
for these single source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of
components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments, or higher
prices for these components, or both, any of which could materially and
adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
No
assurance can be given that one or more of Centennial's vendors will not reduce
supplies to Centennial.


EMPLOYEES

     As of December 23, 2000, Centennial had 150 full-time employees, of whom 8
were executive officers, 24 were involved in sales and marketing, 18 were
involved with engineering and product development, 15 were involved with
administration and 85 were involved in manufacturing.
None of Centennial's
employees are represented by a labor union.


PROPERTIES

     Centennial maintains its principal executive offices, research and
development and ISO 9001 certified manufacturing operations in a 34,000 square
foot leased facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
Centennial currently pays
rent of approximately $25,000 per month pursuant to a lease that expires on
April 30, 2002.
The lease contains an option to renew for an additional
five-year period.
The lease provides for annual rent increases of 4% and
provides that Centennial pays to its landlord, as additional rent, its pro rata
share of certain operational and maintenance costs at the facility during the
term of the lease.

     
Centennial conducts business through leased sales offices in the United
States and its United Kingdom office located in Cheshire, England.
Centennial
believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs and that
adequate facilities for expansion, if required, are available at competitive
rates.


LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, Centennial is party to legal proceedings arising out of
the normal course of business.
Management of Centennial does not believe that
any such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on Centennial's business, financial condition or results
of operations.
In addition, Centennial has been or is party to other litigation
as summarized below.

  
CLASS ACTION LITIGATION

     Centennial has been party to various class action lawsuits which were
commenced principally during fiscal 1997 and 1998.
A substantial number of the
participants in these class action lawsuits participated in settlements with
Centennial that became effective during fiscal 1999.
The following discusses the
history of these class action lawsuits, together with the settlements that were
entered into principally in fiscal 1999.

     
Since the announcement on February 11, 1997 that Centennial was undertaking
an inquiry into the accuracy of its prior reported financial results, and that
preliminary information had raised questions as to whether reported results
contained material misstatements, approximately 40 purported class action
lawsuits were filed in or transferred to the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts.
These complaints asserted claims against
Centennial and its board of directors, officers and former independent
accountants, among others, under certain federal and state laws.
These class
action lawsuits were purportedly brought by and on behalf of purchasers of
Centennial's common stock (1) between Centennial's initial public offering on
April 12, 1994 and February 10, 1997 or (2) on February 25, 1997.

     
On February 9, 1998, these class action lawsuits were consolidated (the
CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION) and the lead counsel representing the plaintiffs in the
Consolidated Litigation filed a Stipulation of Settlement (the SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT), whereby Centennial and certain of its officers and directors would
be released from liability arising from the allegations included in the
Consolidated Litigation.
In return, Centennial paid the plaintiffs in the
Consolidated Litigation $1.475 million in cash and issued to these plaintiffs
854,300 shares or 37% of Centennial common stock.
Centennial also adopted
certain corporate governance policies and procedures.
The Settlement Agreement
became effective on July 20, 1998.
All shares issued in connection with the
Consolidated Litigation are included in the weighted average shares outstanding
calculation from July 20, 1998 forward.

     
A number of class members elected not to participate in the Settlement
Agreement described above.
In September 1999, Centennial reached an agreement
with a number of these parties.
In return, Centennial paid $500,000 in cash to
settle these claims (the ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT).
For the remaining
parties who did not participate in the Settlement Agreement or the Additional
Settlement Agreement, Centennial believes that the applicable Federal statute of
limitations has likely expired and that it does not have material exposure to
these parties.
During fiscal 2000, Centennial revised its estimate of the
allocation between cash and common stock of the $20 million provision for
settlement of all such shareholder litigation recorded during fiscal 1997
related to the class action litigation.
Accordingly, Centennial reclassified
certain amounts in fiscal 2000 from the original settlement reserve to accrued
liabilities, representing the Additional Settlement Agreement described above
and a remaining estimate of the probable costs to be incurred in connection with
the remaining parties not a party to the Settlement Agreement or the Additional
Settlement Agreement.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial made a partial payment of
$188,000 in settlement of certain of these claims.
In December 2000, Centennial
paid the remaining amount of $312,000.

     
In fiscal 2000, the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Litigation reached an
agreement with Centennial's former Interim Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence J.
Ramaekers, and his employer, Jay Alix & Associates (JAY ALIX), regarding the
plaintiffs' alleged claims against them.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial paid Jay
Alix and Mr. Ramaekers $1.0 million for legal fees incurred and Jay Alix and Mr.
Ramaekers released any and all claims against Centennial, its directors and and
its affiliates.

  
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION INVESTIGATION

     In February 1997, Centennial was notified that the Boston District Office
of the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an investigation of it.

Centennial cooperated fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On
September 26, 2000, Centennial entered into an administrative proceeding fully
resolving the issues arising from the conduct of former members of Centennial's
senior management and the restatement of certain financial statements.

  
WEBSECURE LITIGATION

     On and after March 26, 1997, several complaints were filed against
WebSecure, certain officers, directors and underwriters of WebSecure, and
Centennial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
by plaintiffs purporting to represent classes of shareholders who purchased
stock of WebSecure, Inc. between December 5, 1996 and February 27, 1997.
The
claims against Centennial included alleged violations of Sections 11 and 15 of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the WEBSECURE SECURITIES LITIGATION).
In fiscal
1997, Centennial established a reserve of $1.2 million in connection with the
expected settlement of this litigation.

     
In fiscal 2000, Centennial settled the WebSecure Securities Litigation in
return for the issuance of 43,125 shares of Centennial common stock, of which
14,375 shares had been issued as of March 31, 2000 and the payment of $50,000
for notice and administrative costs.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial revised the
estimate of the expected cost to resolve this matter based on the final
settlement amounts, which resulted in income of $940,000.
All shares to be
issued in connection with this settlement are included in the weighted average
shares outstanding calculation from September 17, 1999 forward.
On January 8,
2001, the remaining 28,750 shares were issued.

  
OTHER

     On May 12, 2000, Centennial received a complaint from Mr. Dennis M.
O'Connor alleging that he is owed approximately $485,000 in connection with
legal services provided by O'Connor, Broude & Aronson prior to May 12, 1997.

Because of the early stage of this litigation, Centennial is not able to make an
assessment as to its likely outcome.

     
On July 13, 2000, Centennial received a complaint from Mr. Thomas L.
DePetrillo alleging that he was owed approximately $1,000,000 in connection with
securities that Mr. DePetrillo claims were not delivered on a timely basis.
This
lawsuit includes allegations substantially identical to those asserted by Mr.
DePetrillo in a lawsuit filed against Centennial in July 1998.
In October 2000,
Centennial settled the complaint from Mr. DePetrillo with a cash payment of
$375,000.

     
On February 2, 2001, Centennial was notified of a complaint filed against
it by Onyx, Inc. Onyx served as one of Centennial's exclusive sales
representatives for certain products in five New England states during the
mid-1990's.
Onyx alleges that Centennial failed to provide it with an
appropriate accounting of commissions due it and failed to pay all commissions
due.
Because of the early stage of this litigation, Centennial is unable to make
an assessment as to its likely outcome.


QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Centennial's financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses.

Centennial believes that all of the carrying amounts approximate fair value.

                CENTENNIAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
         OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CENTENNIAL

OVERVIEW

  GENERAL

     Centennial's primary focus is on the design, manufacturing and marketing of
PC cards used for industrial and commercial applications.
Its main customers are
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and value added resellers (VARs).

Centennial PC cards provide added functionality to devices containing
microprocessors by supplying increased storage capacity, communications
capabilities and programmed software for specialized applications.

     
On November 30, 2000, after receiving approval for listing, Centennial
commenced trading on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol "CENL."

     On January 22, 2001, Centennial entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Reorganization with Solectron.
Under the terms of the agreement,
Solectron will issue or reserve for issuance upon the exercise of assumed stock
options approximately 2.96 million shares of Solectron common stock in exchange
for all of Centennial's fully diluted equity, including all of Centennial's
outstanding stock options to be assumed by Solectron in connection with the
transaction.
The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is expected
to close during the second quarter of calendar year 2001.
The completion of the
transaction is subject to governmental approvals, including foreign antitrust
clearance, approval of the transaction by Centennial stockholders and other
customary closing conditions.

  
ACQUISITION OF THE FLASH MEMORY CARD BUSINESS OF INTEL CORPORATION

     On December 29, 1999, Centennial acquired the flash memory card business of
Intel Corporation.
The acquired business included the PCMCIA card families
(Series 2, Value series 100 and 200) and the miniature card families (Series 100
and 200) and related inventory.
This acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
In consideration for the
acquisition, Centennial paid cash of $2.0 million, issued a secured promissory
note for $4.0 million and issued 60,000 shares of series B convertible preferred
stock which represented 600,000 shares of common stock, on an as-converted
basis.
The promissory note bore interest at the rate of 9% per annum and was
repaid in full in September 2000.
The series B convertible preferred stock has a
liquidation preference of $4.8 million and Intel Corporation received certain
registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the series B convertible preferred stock.

     
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in
this document.

NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 23, 2000 AND DECEMBER 25, 1999

  NET SALES

     Net sales increased 155% to $58.4 million for the nine months ended
December 23, 2000 compared to $22.3 million for the same period a year ago.
This
increase in sales was primarily due to a 68% increase in the average selling
price of products sold during the first nine months of fiscal 2001 as compared
to the same period of fiscal 2000, combined with a 31% increase in the volume of
PC cards sold during the same period and $8.8 million of sales of electronic
components, while there were no sales of electronic components in the prior
year.
The December 1999 acquisition of the flash memory card business of Intel
Corporation combined with the addition of new customers and higher volumes with
some existing customers contributed to the increase in the volume of PC cards
sold during the nine months ended December 23, 2000.
Increasing component costs,
combined with a relative increase in the product mix toward more expensive
products, contributed to the increase in the average selling price of
Centennial's products.
For the nine months ended December 23, 2000, there were
also approximately $8.8 million of sales of electronic components that resulted
in a gross profit of approximately $4.4 million.
There were no sales of
electronic components in the prior year.
This analysis sometimes refers to sales
of PC cards and related products, which Centennial's management believes to be
more meaningful than total sales because total sales includes sales of
electronic components which is not the focus of its business and may not
reoccur.

     
Over the past few quarters, Centennial's management believes some of its
competitors have had difficulty obtaining certain components and its success in
obtaining such components has given Centennial a competitive advantage.

Centennial's management believes these competitors are now able to more readily
purchase such components, which may increase competitive pressures and may have
an adverse effect on Centennial's revenues and gross margins, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

     
For the nine months ended December 23, 2000, one customer, Solectron,
represented 12% of sales of PC cards and related products.
For the nine months
ended December 25, 1999, Solectron and Lucent Technologies each accounted for
10% of sales of PC cards and related products.
Nortel Networks engages several
contract manufacturers to complete the final assembly of a majority of its
products for which Centennial has historically supplied PC cards.
Combined sales
of PC cards and related products to Nortel Networks and these contract
manufacturers for the nine months ended December 23, 2000 and 1999 were 22% and
20%, respectively.
No other customers represented more than 10% of sales of PC
cards and related products for the nine month periods ended December 23, 2000
and 1999.
Centennial had accounts receivable from Solectron of $1,555,000 as of
December 23, 2000.
A relatively small number of customers account for a
significant percentage of sales.
If any of these customers were to reduce
significantly the amount of business they conduct Centennial, its revenue could
decrease which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition and results of operations.
In late 1999, Solectron merged with one of
Centennial's competitors, SMART Modular Technologies, Inc. which could result in
a decrease of sales.

     
Approximately 20% and 18% of sales of PC cards and related products for the
nine months ended December 23, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were outside the
United States, primarily in several Western European countries, Israel and
Canada.
No one country, other than the United States, comprised more than 10% of
sales for the nine months ended December 23, 2000 and 1999.

     
On December 29, 1999, Centennial acquired the flash memory card business of
Intel Corporation.
This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase combination
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
For the quarter ended December 23, 2000, a
$0.1 million payable to Intel Corporation as additional consideration was
recorded as an intangible asset based on orders received and scheduled for
shipment during the measurement period.

  GROSS PROFIT

     Gross profit from the sales of PC cards and related products increased 142%
to $19.3 million or 39% of related sales for the first nine months of fiscal
2001 compared to $8.0 million or 35% of sales for the same period a year ago.

The increase in gross profit is attributable to the increase in revenues driven
by higher average selling prices and increased volume.
The higher gross margin
rates are primarily due to increased efficiencies related to the higher revenue
levels combined with a relative increase in the product mix of sales toward
higher margin products and higher average selling prices for Centennial's
products.
For the nine months ended December 23, 2000, there were also
approximately $8.8 million of sales of electronic components that resulted in a
gross profit on a pro forma basis of approximately $4.4 million.
There were no
sales of electronic components in the prior year.
Sales of electronic components
is not the focus of Centennial's business; however, there may be some sales of
electronic components in the future, although Centennial cannot be sure as to
the nature, timing or amount of sales of electronic components, if any.

  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     For the first nine months of fiscal 2001, research and development costs
increased 54% to $1.6 million from $1.1 million in the same period of fiscal
2000.
The higher research and development costs are generally due to higher
engineering material expenditures combined with an increased percentage of
employees (both new and existing) focused on research and development projects.

  
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

     Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the nine
months of fiscal 2001, compared to $5.3 million in the same period of fiscal
2000.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended December 23, 2000, as compared to the same period a year ago, is
primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs and to significant
bonuses earned by senior management and approved by the board of directors.

Centennial expects to incur significant professional and advisory fees in
connection with our efforts to merge with Solectron.

  
OTHER INCOME

     Net interest expense was $23,000 for the nine months ended December 23,
2000 and net interest income was $230,000 for the nine months ended December 25,
1999.
The change to net interest expense (income) is due to interest expense on
the $4.0 million note payable to Intel Corporation combined with less interest
income due to reduced cash balances.
The Intel note was repaid in full in
September 2000.

  
INCOME TAXES

     The estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 will be approximately 6%,
an increase from approximately 2% in fiscal 2000.
The increase is attributable
to higher profitability and the anticipated utilization of remaining state net
operating loss carryforwards.

  
EARNINGS PER SHARE

     In December 1999, Centennial issued preferred stock to Intel Corporation
related to the acquisition of its flash memory card business.
As a result of
this transaction, diluted weighted average outstanding shares increased by
600,000 shares for the nine months ended December 23, 2000 as compared to the
same period ended December 25, 1999.
Additionally, the effect of stock options
increased diluted weighted average outstanding shares by approximately 700,000
for the nine months ended December 23, 2000 as compared to the nine months ended
December 25, 1999.


TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 25, 2000 AND MARCH 31, 1999

  NET SALES

     Net sales increased 29% to $35.6 million for fiscal 2000 compared to $27.6
million for fiscal 1999.
The increase in sales is attributable to an increase in
units shipped.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, Centennial's sales to Cisco
Systems, the primary customer of the flash memory card business acquired from
Intel Corporation, were approximately $2.0 million.
Following Centennial's
acquisition of the flash memory card business, Cisco Systems notified Centennial
that they would no longer purchase from Centennial and cancelled all remaining
orders.
Component costs, primarily related to memory chips, increased
significantly throughout fiscal 2000.

     
For fiscal 2000, no customer represented more than 10% of Centennial's
sales.
Nortel Networks represented 5% and 14% of Centennial's sales in fiscal
2000 and 1999, respectively.
During fiscal 1999, Nortel Networks engaged several
contract manufacturers to complete the final assembly of a majority of its
products for which Centennial has historically supplied PC cards.
Centennial's
sales to these contract manufacturers for both fiscal 2000 and 1999 represented
14% of Centennial's sales.

     
For fiscal 2000 and 1999, sales outside of the United States were
approximately 20% and 12%, respectively, of Centennial's sales.
Sales outside of
the United States are primarily to customers in several Western European
countries, although sales to customers in any one country did not comprise more
than 10% of Centennial's sales for fiscal 2000 or 1999.

  GROSS PROFIT

     Gross profit increased 22% to $10.5 million for fiscal 2000 compared to
$8.7 million for fiscal 1999.
Gross margins were 30% for fiscal 2000 and 31% for
fiscal 1999.
The fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 included approximately $4.4
million of net sales of inventory acquired with the acquisition of the flash
memory card business of Intel Corporation.
This acquired inventory is carried at
its estimated fair market value.
Accordingly, the sale of this inventory
resulted in a lower gross margin than sales of Centennial's other inventory.

Excluding the effect of sales of the acquired inventory and related costs of
this acquired inventory, the gross margin for fiscal 2000 would have been 34% as
compared to 30%.

     
Centennial has been able to achieve higher margins on Centennial products
primarily due to a significant amount of custom product sales through its direct
sales force combined with a small amount of software and service revenue.

Centennial's existing products and services tend to have higher margins than
standard products, which comprise substantially all of the acquired business'
product line.

     
Centennial experienced an increase in its flash memory costs throughout
fiscal 2000.
Centennial increased the average selling price of Centennial
products during fiscal 2000 as a result of its increased component costs.
This
increase in Centennial's average selling price enabled Centennial to maintain
its gross margin.

  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Centennial's research and development expenditures increased significantly
to $1.9 million or 5% of sales in fiscal 2000 compared to $0.8 million or 3% of
sales for fiscal 1999.
The higher research and development costs were due
generally to increased spending on outside consultants, higher engineering
material expenditures and recruiting and relocation costs combined with an
increased percentage of employees focused on research and development projects.

  
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

     Selling, general and administrative expenses were $6.7 million or 19% of
sales in fiscal 2000 compared to $6.1 million or 22% of sales in fiscal 1999.

The $0.6 million increase in these expenses for fiscal 2000 was mainly
attributed to higher staffing costs necessary to generate and support
Centennial's increase in sales.

  
OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE

     In fiscal 2000, Centennial incurred a loss of $343,000 on the disposal of
certain equipment that was replaced.

     
In fiscal 2000, Centennial settled the WebSecure Securities Litigation in
return for the issuance of 43,125 shares of Centennial's common stock, of which
14,375 shares had been issued on November 4, 1999 and 28,750 shares were issued
on January 8, 2001, and the payment of $50,000 for notice and administrative
costs.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial revised its estimate of the expected cost to
resolve this matter based on the final settlement amounts, which resulted in
income of $940,000.
All shares to be issued in connection with this settlement
are included in the weighted average shares outstanding calculation from
September 17, 1999 forward.

  
NET INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE

     Net interest income was $185,000 for fiscal 2000 compared to net interest
income of $344,000 for fiscal 1999.
This decrease was primarily attributable to
decreased funds invested or on deposit in interest bearing accounts, as well as
increased borrowing under capitalized leases during fiscal 2000 combined with
interest expense on the note payable.

  NET INCOME PER SHARE

     On July 20, 1999, Centennial's shareholders approved a one-for-eight
reverse stock split of the common stock, which was effective as of the opening
of the stock markets on July 23, 1999.
In this report, all per share amounts and
numbers of shares have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split.

     
As a result of the Intel Corporation transaction described more fully
above, diluted weighted average outstanding shares increased by 600,000 shares
as of December 29, 1999.


TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1999 AND MARCH 31, 1998

  NET SALES

     Sales decreased 2% to approximately $27.6 million for fiscal 1999 compared
to $28.3 million for fiscal 1998.
The average selling price for Centennial's
products fell approximately 7% during fiscal 1999, which was partially offset by
an increase in the volume of PC cards sold of approximately 5%.
Decreasing
component costs between periods and competitive pricing pressures contributed to
the decrease in the average selling price of Centennial's products.

     
Sales outside of the United States represented 12% of sales in fiscal 1999
compared to 14% of sales for fiscal 1998.
At the end of fiscal 1998, Centennial
opened a new sales office in Cheshire, England.

     
Sales to Nortel Networks represented 14% of sales in fiscal 1999 compared
to 29% of sales in fiscal 1998.
During fiscal 1999, Nortel Networks engaged a
contract manufacturer to complete the final assembly of a majority of its
products for which Centennial has historically supplied PC cards.
Centennial's
sales to this contract manufacturer represented almost 10% of Centennial's sales
during fiscal 1999.
No other customer accounted for more than 10% of
Centennial's sales during fiscal 1999.

  
GROSS PROFIT

     Gross profit increased 89% to $8.7 million for fiscal 1999 compared to $4.6
million for fiscal 1998.
Gross margins were 31% for fiscal 1999 compared to 16%
for fiscal 1998.
During fiscal 1999, Centennial sold portions of some customized
inventory for approximately $1.2 million, the cost of which had been previously
fully reserved due to a dispute with the customer for whom the customized cards
were originally produced and who had attempted to cancel the order.
The gross
margin for fiscal 1999, excluding this sale of fully reserved inventory, was
28%.
Costs of goods sold include provisions for inventory obsolescence of $0 in
fiscal 1999 and $886,000 in fiscal 1998, representing 3% of sales in fiscal
1998, which reflects the strategy of prior management to build inventory in
anticipation of customer orders, a portion of which did not materialize.

Centennial's gross margins were also negatively impacted during fiscal 1998 by
declining memory chip prices, which reduced PC card selling prices in certain
situations where Centennial had already purchased memory chips at higher prices.

  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Research and development costs decreased by 11% to approximately $750,000
in fiscal 1999 compared to $838,000 for fiscal 1998.

  
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 39% to $6.1
million in fiscal 1999 compared to $10.0 million in fiscal 1998.
This decrease
primarily resulted from the non-recurrence in fiscal 1999 of the following
expenses incurred in fiscal 1998: legal and consulting expenses relating to the
negotiation and finalization of the settlement of the class action litigation
against us, the settlement of several other legal claims, the filing of revised
tax returns, and the conclusion of Centennial's arrangements for interim senior
management consulting services.
Bad debt expenses were also higher in fiscal
1998 than in fiscal 1999 as Centennial provided specific reserves for several of
Centennial's former customers in fiscal 1998.
Centennial also paid non-recurring
retention bonuses during fiscal 1998 to several key employees following

the announcement of the special investigation into Centennial's prior reported
financial results.
Centennial also incurred non-recurring costs in fiscal 1998
in hiring a new senior management team, and paid severance benefits to certain
of the former officers and employees.
Centennial also incurred non-recurring
costs during fiscal 1998 in closing its Canadian and UK offices and establishing
a new sales office in Cheshire, England.
Centennial incurred increased sales
expenses related to its new UK sales office during fiscal 1999.
Employee
benefits and commissions expenses increased in fiscal 1999 as Centennial
implemented a profit-sharing plan and a new commissions program.

  
LOSS ON INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

     Loss on investment activities consists of write-downs, valuation
adjustments and accruals for losses recorded associated with certain
investments.
During fiscal 1999, Centennial reduced the carrying value of its
investment in Century Electronics Manufacturing, Inc. by $733,000 to $1.7
million, reflecting Centennial's assessment of the deterioration in the value of
this investment.

  
PROCEEDS FROM RESOLUTION OF CUSTOMER DISPUTE

     During fiscal 1998, Centennial filed suit against a customer regarding
inventory specifically purchased and manufactured pursuant to a purchase order
from the customer.
The customer attempted to cancel a portion of the purchase
order.
Centennial disputed the customer's claim that the purchase order
cancellation was effective.
During fiscal 1998, Centennial fully reserved the
cost of this custom inventory of approximately $1.8 million due to the legal
costs and inherent uncertainties involved in litigation.

     
During fiscal 1999, Centennial settled the litigation.
As a result of this
settlement, Centennial received $1.6 million in cash and the customer agreed
that Centennial retain this custom inventory.
During fiscal 1999, Centennial
recognized the cash payment of $1.6 million as income.
Also during fiscal 1999,
after the settlement agreement was reached, Centennial sold portions of the
custom inventory for approximately $1.2 million, which was included in net
sales.

  
OTHER EXPENSES, NET

     During fiscal 1999, Centennial incurred a loss on the disposal of certain
equipment that had a net book value of approximately $132,000.
During fiscal
1998, Centennial increased its accrual for Special Investigation Costs by
$597,000 due to incremental costs.
During fiscal 1998, Centennial paid in full
its line-of-credit and lease financing obligations with the bank that was
previously providing us with credit facilities.
That bank required Centennial to
pay lease cancellation charges of approximately $258,000 in order to release its
lien on the equipment being financed pursuant to those leases.

  
NET INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE

     Net interest income was $344,000 for fiscal 1999 and net interest expense
was $56,000 in fiscal 1998, reflecting cash available for investment in fiscal
1999 and outstanding borrowings during fiscal 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Since inception, Centennial has financed its operating activities primarily
from public and private offerings of equity securities, loans from financial
institutions and positive cash flows from operations.
At December 23, 2000,
Centennial had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.1 million.

Centennial believes the existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash
from operations and available financing arrangements, including the revolving
credit line, will be sufficient to meet its current anticipated working capital
and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.

  
OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     During the first nine months of fiscal 2001, working capital increased
$13.5 million to $24.8 million at December 23, 2000, compared to working capital
of $11.3 million at March 25, 2000.
This increase is due principally to the net
income of $11.5 million in the nine months ended December 23, 2000.
At March 31,

2000 and 1999, working capital was $11.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively.

This increase in working capital is primarily due to the acquisition of the
flash memory card business of Intel Corporation combined with positive operating
results, which is partially offset by higher inventory levels.
The inventory
balance increased from $3.0 million at March 31, 1999 to $14.6 million at March
31, 2000.
This significant increase is attributable to approximately $7.5
million in inventory at March 31, 2000 that was acquired with the acquisition of
Intel's flash memory card business.
In addition, Centennial increased its raw
material levels of the flash memory component.
The higher flash memory level is
due to higher planned purchases in the fourth quarter due to expected shortages.

Additionally, Centennial has had to increase its inventory levels as supplier
lead times have increased.

     
On June 2, 2000, Centennial entered into a credit agreement with a bank for
a revolving credit facility of $4.0 million.
This arrangement contains certain
limitations and covenants; the most restrictive of which is a covenant regarding
the maintenance of liquidity, as defined in the credit agreement.
Available
borrowings are based upon a percentage of accounts receivable.
The credit
facility is secured by substantially all of Centennial's assets.
As of December
23, 2000, Centennial had no borrowings under this credit facility.
This credit
agreement expires on July 31, 2002.

  
INVESTING TRANSACTIONS

     Net capital expenditures amounted to $533,000 for the nine months ended
December 23, 2000 compared to $307,000 for the nine months ended December 25,
1999.
Net capital expenditures amounted to $473,000 during fiscal 2000 compared
to $669,000 in fiscal 1999.

     
In fiscal 2000, Centennial invested $248,000 for approximately a 7%
interest in Elan Digital Systems Limited.
Elan was formed in the United Kingdom
during 1976 and offers application engineering and design services for
microcontroller based solutions.
This investment is carried on Centennial's
balance sheet under "Investments" and its operating results are reported under
the cost method of accounting.

  
FINANCING TRANSACTIONS

     
In the third quarter of fiscal 2001, Centennial entered into a four-year
capital lease for new manufacturing equipment with a monthly payment of
approximately $10,000.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial entered into two five-year
capital leases for new manufacturing equipment with monthly payments that
aggregate $22,535.

  INVESTMENT IN CENTURY ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING, INC.

     
Since October 1996, Centennial has held an equity interest in Century
Electronics Manufacturing, Inc., a contract manufacturer.
On February 4, 1998,
Century redeemed a portion of Centennial's debt and equity holdings in Century
in exchange for $9.7 million in cash, $4.0 million of Century series B
convertible preferred stock and the forgiveness of certain interest.
The series
B convertible preferred stock is equivalent upon conversion to approximately 7%,
non-diluted, of Century's outstanding shares, is non-voting, has no dividend,
and has a liquidation preference of $4.0 million senior to the common
shareholders and subordinate to the holders of Century's series A convertible
preferred stock.
Centennial recorded a loss on investment activities of $5.1
million in the third quarter of fiscal 1998 to reflect the difference between
the fair value of the consideration received from Century and the carrying value
of its investment in Century.
During fiscal 1999, Centennial reduced the
carrying value of its investment in Century by $733,000 to $1.7 million,
reflecting management's assessment of the deterioration in value of the
investment.
On January 9, 2001, Century filed voluntary petitions for relief
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
In the quarter ended
December 23, 2000, Centennial recorded an adjustment to its investment in
Century resulting in a $1,700,000 charge to other income since management
believes that the investment has suffered a decline, which is
other-than-temporary.
This reduced the carrying value of this Century investment
to $0.

  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Centennial is party from time to time to legal proceedings arising out of
the normal course of business.
Management of Centennial does not believe that
any such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on Centennial's business, financial condition or results
of operations.
In addition, Centennial has been or is party to other litigation
as summarized below.

     
Class Action Litigation

     Centennial has been party to various class action lawsuits which were
commenced principally during fiscal 1997 and 1998.
A substantial number of the
participants in these class action lawsuits participated in settlements with
Centennial that became effective during fiscal 1999.
The following discusses the
history of these class action lawsuits, together with the settlements that were
entered into principally in fiscal 1999.

     
Since the announcement on February 11, 1997 that Centennial was undertaking
an inquiry into the accuracy of its prior reported financial results, and that
preliminary information had raised questions as to whether reported results
contained material misstatements, approximately 40 purported class action
lawsuits were filed in or transferred to the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts.
These complaints asserted claims against
Centennial and its Board of Directors, officers and former independent
accountants, among others, under certain federal and state laws.
These class
action lawsuits were purportedly brought by and on behalf of purchasers of
Centennial's common stock (1) between Centennial's initial public offering on
April 12, 1994 and February 10, 1997 or (2) on February 25, 1997.

     
On February 9, 1998, these class action lawsuits were consolidated (the
CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION), and the lead counsel representing the plaintiffs in
the Consolidated Litigation filed a Stipulation of Settlement (the SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT), whereby Centennial and certain of its officers and directors would
be released from liability arising from the allegations included in the
Consolidated Litigation.
In return, Centennial paid the plaintiffs in the
Consolidated Litigation $1.475 million in cash and issued to these plaintiffs
854,300 shares or 37% of Centennial common stock.
Centennial also adopted
certain corporate governance policies and procedures.
The Settlement Agreement
became effective on July 20, 1998.
All shares issued in connection with the
Consolidated Litigation are included in the weighted average shares outstanding
calculation from July 20, 1998 forward.

     
A number of class members elected not to participate in the Settlement
Agreement described above.
In September 1999, Centennial reached an agreement
with a number of these parties.
In return, Centennial paid $500,000 in cash to
settle these claims (the ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT).
For the remaining
parties who did not participate in the Settlement Agreement or the Additional
Settlement Agreement, Centennial believes that the applicable Federal statute of
limitations has likely expired and that it does not have material exposure to
these parties.
During fiscal 2000, Centennial revised its estimate of the
allocation between cash and common stock of the $20 million provision for
settlement of all such shareholder litigation recorded during fiscal 1997
related to the class action litigation.
Accordingly, Centennial reclassified
certain amounts in fiscal 2000 from the original settlement reserve to accrued
liabilities, representing the Additional Settlement Agreement described above
and a remaining estimate of the probable costs to be incurred in connection with
the remaining parties not a party to the Settlement Agreement or the Additional
Settlement Agreement.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial made a partial payment of
$188,000 in settlement of certain of these claims.
In December 2000, Centennial
paid the remaining amount of $312,000.

     
In fiscal 2000, the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Litigation reached an
agreement with Centennial's former Interim Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence J.
Ramaekers, and his employer, Jay Alix & Associates (JAY ALIX), regarding the
plaintiffs' alleged claims against them.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial paid Jay
Alix and Mr. Ramaekers $1.0 million for legal fees incurred and Jay Alix and Mr.
Ramaekers released any and all claims against Centennial, its affiliates and its
directors.

     
Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation

     In February 1997, Centennial was notified that the Boston District Office
of the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an investigation of it.

Centennial cooperated fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On
September 26, 2000, Centennial entered into an administrative proceeding fully
resolving the issues arising from the conduct of former members of Centennial's
senior management and the restatement of certain financial statements.

     
WebSecure Litigation

     On and after March 26, 1997, several complaints were filed against
WebSecure, certain officers, directors and underwriters of WebSecure, and
Centennial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
by plaintiffs purporting to represent classes of shareholders who purchased
stock of WebSecure, Inc. between December 5, 1996 and February 27, 1997.
The
claims against Centennial included alleged violations of Sections 11 and 15 of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the WEBSECURE SECURITIES LITIGATION).
In fiscal
1997, Centennial established a reserve of $1.2 million in connection with the
expected settlement of this litigation.

     
In fiscal 2000, Centennial settled the WebSecure Securities Litigation in
return for the issuance of 43,125 shares of Centennial common stock, of which
14,375 shares had been issued as of March 31, 2000 and the payment of $50,000
for notice and administrative costs.
In fiscal 2000, Centennial revised the
estimate of the expected cost to resolve this matter based on the final
settlement amounts, which resulted in income of $940,000.
All shares to be
issued in connection with this settlement are included in the weighted average
shares outstanding calculation from September 17, 1999 forward.
On January 8,
2001, the remaining 28,750 shares were issued.

     
Other

     On May 12, 2000, Centennial received a complaint from Mr. Dennis M.
O'Connor alleging that he is owed approximately $485,000 in connection with
legal services provided by O'Connor, Broude & Aronson prior to May 12, 1997.

Because of the early stage of this litigation, Centennial is not able to make an
assessment as to its likely outcome.

     
On July 13, 2000, Centennial received a complaint from Mr. Thomas L.
DePetrillo alleging that he was owed approximately $1,000,000 in connection with
securities that Mr. DePetrillo claims were not delivered on a timely basis.
This
lawsuit includes allegations substantially identical to those asserted by Mr.
DePetrillo in a lawsuit filed against Centennial in July 1998.
In October 2000,
Centennial settled the complaint from Mr. DePetrillo with a cash payment of
$375,000.

     
On February 2, 2001, Centennial was notified of a complaint filed against
it by Onyx, Inc. Onyx served as one of Centennial's exclusive sales
representatives for certain products in five New England states during the
mid-1990's.
Onyx alleges that Centennial failed to provide it with an
appropriate accounting of commissions due it and failed to pay all commissions
due.
Because of the early stage of this litigation, Centennial is unable to make
an assessment as to its likely outcome.

           
COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF CENTENNIAL COMMON STOCK
      AND SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND SOLECTRON COMMON STOCK

     The following is a description of the material differences between the
rights of holders of Centennial common stock, Centennial series B convertible
preferred stock and Solectron common stock.
While we believe that the
description covers the material differences between the three, this summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you.
You should
carefully read this entire document and the other documents we refer to for a
more complete understanding of the differences between being a stockholder of
Centennial and being a stockholder of Solectron.

     
Centennial's certificate of incorporation, including the certificate of
designation of the rights, preferences and terms for the series B convertible
preferred stock, and bylaws, each as currently in effect, govern your rights as
a stockholder of Centennial.
After completion of the merger, you will become a
stockholder of Solectron.
Solectron's certificate of incorporation and bylaws
will govern your rights as a stockholder of Solectron.
We are each incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Accordingly, the Delaware General
Corporation Law will continue to govern your rights as a stockholder after
completion of the merger.

     
Except as indicated below, holders of the series B convertible preferred
stock have the similar or identical rights as Centennial's common stockholders.


COMMON STOCK

     Both Solectron and Centennial have one class of common stock issued and
outstanding.
Holders of Solectron common stock and holders of Centennial common
stock are each entitled to one vote for each share held.

     
Under Centennial's certificate of incorporation, the board is allowed to
determine from time to time additional designations and powers, preferences and
rights and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the shares of each
class of capital stock.


PREFERRED STOCK

     The certificates of incorporation of Solectron and Centennial provide that
their boards of directors are authorized to provide for the issuance of shares
of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix the
designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and
any related qualifications, limitations or restrictions.

     
The series B convertible preferred stock ranks senior to the Centennial
common stock and to all other classes in series of equity securities of
Centennial which by their terms do not rank senior to Centennial's series A
junior participating preferred stock.


VOTING RIGHTS

     Solectron common stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of
capital stock held by the stockholder.

     
Centennial common stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of
capital stock held by the stockholder.

     
Each share of series B convertible preferred stock entitles the holder to
one vote per share of common stock which would be issuable upon conversion of
such shares of series B convertible preferred stock.
Presently, the series B
convertible preferred stock is convertible into 10 shares of Centennial common
stock.

     
Holders of Centennial series B convertible preferred stock are entitled to
vote as a class with regard to:

     - an increase in the authorized or issued amounts of series B convertible
       preferred stock or the creation of any stock senior to the series B
       convertible preferred stock;

     - any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the
       certificate of incorporation, bylaws or certificate of designation which
       adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or power, or
       restriction provided for the benefit of the series B convertible
       preferred stockholders; and

     - any corporate or stockholder action that reclassifies any outstanding
       shares into shares that have a preference or priority to receive
       dividends or assets senior to or on parity with the holders of series B
       convertible preferred stock.

     
For all other matters, the holders of series B convertible preferred stock
vote together with the common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of
Centennial stockholders, whether at a meeting or by written consent.


BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Solectron's certificate of incorporation indicates that the number of
directors which will constitute the whole board of directors of Solectron shall
be as specified in Solectron's bylaws.
Solectron's bylaws currently indicate
that the number of directors of the corporation shall consist of 10 members
until changed by an amendment to the bylaws, duly adopted by the board of
directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to Solectron's
certificate of incorporation.
An amendment to Solectron's bylaws requires the
vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the stockholders of
Solectron entitled to vote.
In addition, Solectron's certificate of
incorporation allows the board of directors to amend Solectron's bylaws.

     
Solectron's directors are elected to hold office until the expiration of
the term for which they are elected and until their successors have been duly
elected and qualified.

     
Under Centennial's bylaws, the number of directors shall be determined by
the board of directors.
If the board does not set the number of directors, there
will be one director.
Centennial's board of directors currently consists of
seven directors.
The directors are elected at the annual meeting of the
stockholders.
Each director holds office until the next annual meeting and until
his or her successor is elected and qualified.


CUMULATIVE VOTING FOR DIRECTORS

     Under Delaware law, unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation
provides otherwise, there can be no cumulative voting for the election of
directors.
The Solectron certificate provides for cumulative voting.
The
Centennial certificate does not allow for cumulative voting.


DIRECTOR VOTING

     The Solectron and Centennial bylaws provide that the number of directors
constituting a quorum shall be a majority of the number of authorized directors
or the number of directors in office, respectively.
The act of a majority of the
directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum is generally valid
as a corporate act.


REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Under Solectron's bylaws, (unless otherwise restricted by statute, by
Solectron's certificate of incorporation or bylaws) any director or the entire
board of directors may be removed with or without cause by the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
