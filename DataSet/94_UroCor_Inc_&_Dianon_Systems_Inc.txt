BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

      In September 1995, November 1997 and February 1998, Dianon and UroCor
executed mutual confidentiality agreements pursuant to which each party agreed
to hold in confidence information received concerning the other party in
connection with discussions between the parties concerning potential business
combination transactions.
In March 1998 and April 1998, UroCor sent to Dianon
letters in which UroCor expressed preliminary interest in pursuing a business
combination with Dianon pursuant to an exchange of shares.
Subsequent to
Dianon's receipt of these letters, representatives of our companies discussed
these matters.
In August 1998, Dianon sent a letter to UroCor and made a public
announcement in which Dianon expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a
business combination with UroCor pursuant to a cash purchase by Dianon of UroCor
common stock for $7.50 per share.
Subsequent to UroCor's

                                      I-38

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

receipt of that letter, our companies held various discussions and exchanged
correspondence regarding these matters.
In November 1998, we ceased these
discussions.

      
At a UroCor board meeting on June 20, 2000, Michael W. George, UroCor's
president and chief executive officer, presented to the UroCor board an overview
of the company's historical, current and projected future plans for growth and
various factors enhancing and inhibiting the company's abilities and outlook to
promote future growth.
In connection with that discussion, Mr. George advised
the UroCor board that the company's executive management recommended that the
company engage an investment banking firm to assist it in reviewing the
company's strategic plans for future growth.
The UroCor board authorized the
company's management to continue to review these matters with the board and to
engage an investment banking firm to assist the company in the review.

      
After discussion with the UroCor board members, pursuant to a unanimous
written consent of the UroCor board dated July 18, 2000, the UroCor board
engaged U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to assist the company in connection with its
review of its strategic plan for future growth.

      
At a UroCor board meeting held August 15, 2000, Mr. George and the other
members of UroCor management discussed with the UroCor board the company's
review of its strategic plan.
At that board meeting, representatives of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray made a preliminary presentation to the UroCor board
regarding UroCor and other companies in UroCor's industry.
The U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray representatives also discussed with the UroCor board the potential
for pursuing a business combination transaction as an alternative for maximizing
stockholder value.
At the meeting, the UroCor board authorized UroCor management
and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to continue to review strategic alternatives
including potential business combination transactions with other companies.

      
During the latter half of August 2001, UroCor management and U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray prepared a confidential offering memorandum describing UroCor and
its business for purposes of soliciting preliminary indications of interest from
potential acquirors.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and UroCor concurrently
identified a list of several parties, including Dianon, that might be interested
in pursuing a transaction with UroCor.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray subsequently
contacted these potential acquirors.
Six of the potential acquirors, including
Dianon, reviewed and executed a confidentiality agreement and subsequently
received a copy of the confidential offering memorandum.

      
On September 22, 2000, representatives of Dianon and UroCor had a
conference call which involved a preliminary discussion about UroCor's business.

      
On September 29, 2000 representatives of UroCor made a presentation to
representatives of Dianon, which described certain strategic, operational and
financial information about UroCor.

      
On October 13, 2000, Lazard made a presentation to the Dianon board which
reviewed a preliminary valuation analysis in connection with a potential
acquisition of UroCor.

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

      At a special meeting of the Dianon board on October 13, 2000, the Dianon
board authorized Kevin C. Johnson, Dianon's president and chief executive
officer, to negotiate a letter of preliminary interest in pursuing a business
combination with UroCor.

      
On October 16, 2000, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in which Dianon expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a
business combination with UroCor.
In the October 16, 2000 letter, Dianon
proposed a price of $9.50 for each share of UroCor common stock in a pooling of
interests transaction.
The October 16, 2000 letter stated that any transaction
would be conditioned on the settlement of the pending investigation of UroCor by
the Department of Justice in a manner that would not be deemed to have a
material adverse effect on UroCor.
The October 16, 2000 letter also stated that
any transaction would be conditioned on UroCor's share price immediately prior
to announcement of a transaction not being materially different from its October
13, 2000 closing price of $7.00.
Finally, the October 16, 2000 letter provided
for UroCor to grant Dianon an exclusive period of 30 days to conduct due
diligence on UroCor.

      
On October 17, 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray discussed with the UroCor
board its review of the company's strategic plan, including the status of
discussions with various parties regarding the potential for pursuing a business
combination transaction.
The UroCor board also reviewed the October 16, 2000
letter from Dianon and discussed with UroCor's management and U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray the Dianon letter and the timing and scope of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's discussions with other companies compared to the status of the
discussions with Dianon.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray communicated that due
primarily to UroCor's pending DOJ investigation, none of the other companies
contacted were interested in pursuing a potential business combination
transaction.
Following that discussion, the UroCor board authorized UroCor's
management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to communicate to Dianon and its
investment bankers that UroCor would be interested in discussing a potential
business combination transaction with Dianon subject to further discussion of an
appropriate purchase price for UroCor's shares of common stock, clarification of
certain provisions in the Dianon letter regarding resolution of the Department
of Justice matter and the removal of any conditions linking the proposed
acquisition price to changes in UroCor's common stock trading price.

      
On October 20, 2000, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in which Dianon again expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a
business combination with UroCor.
The October 20, 2000 letter superseded the
October 16, 2000 letter.
In the October 20, 2000 letter, Dianon proposed a fixed
exchange ratio of 0.3038 Dianon shares for each share of UroCor common stock in
a pooling of interests transaction.
This equated to a price of $11.00 per share
based on Dianon's average closing share price over the prior 30 trading days.

The October 20, 2000 letter stated that any transaction would be conditioned on
settlement of the pending investigation of UroCor by the Department of Justice
in a manner that would not have a material adverse effect on UroCor or the
combined company, as determined in Dianon's sole discretion.
Finally, the
October 20, 2000 letter provided for UroCor to grant Dianon an exclusive period
of 30 days to conduct due diligence of UroCor.

      
Subsequent to UroCor's receipt of Dianon's October 20, 2000 letter,
UroCor's management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Dianon's management and
Lazard engaged in various discussions regarding the provisions of that letter.

                                      I-40

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      On October 29, 2000, members of Dianon's management and several directors
of Dianon held a telephonic meeting in which Lazard presented an updated
preliminary valuation analysis of UroCor.

      
On October 30, 2000, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in which Dianon again expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a
business combination with UroCor.
The October 30, 2000 letter superseded the
October 20, 2000 letter.
The terms of Dianon's proposal were the same as in the
October 20, 2000 letter, except that the October 30, 2000 letter defined with
greater specificity the term "material adverse effect" and the circumstances
under which Dianon could conclude that settlement of UroCor's DOJ investigation
could have a material adverse effect on UroCor or the combined company.
The
October 30, 2000 letter also provided for a thirty-day renewal of the
exclusivity period for Dianon to conduct due diligence of UroCor if UroCor had
not settled with the DOJ and Dianon continued in good faith to negotiate a
purchase of UroCor.

      
Following UroCor's receipt of Dianon's October 30, 2000 letter, UroCor's
management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Dianon's management and Lazard
engaged in various discussions regarding the terms of that letter.

      
On November 2, 2000, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in which Dianon again expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a
business combination with UroCor.
The November 2, 2000 letter superseded the
October 30, 2000 letter.
The terms of Dianon's proposal were the same as in the
October 30, 2000 letter, except that Dianon agreed to notify UroCor if prior to
the end of the 30 day exclusivity period Dianon had determined not to proceed
with the transaction.
After careful consideration of the Dianon letter compared
to the interests of other potential acquirors, on behalf of UroCor, Mr. George
executed the Dianon November 2, 2000 letter.

      
During the week of November 6, 2000, Dianon, Lazard and Dianon's legal
counsel, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, delivered requests for documents to be
reviewed in connection with Dianon's due diligence review of UroCor.

      
During the week of November 13, 2000, representatives of Dianon, Lazard
and Cadwalader, conducted a due diligence review of UroCor in Oklahoma City.

      
During the week of November 20, 2000, Dianon and representatives of Lazard
contacted UroCor and representatives of UroCor to inform UroCor of Dianon's
preliminary due diligence findings, including that any transaction would likely
not qualify for pooling of interests accounting and that the DOJ's investigation
of UroCor had not been concluded to the satisfaction of Dianon.

      
On December 6, 2000, the Dianon board met and management presented the
findings of its due diligence investigation of UroCor, including that any
transaction would likely not qualify for pooling of interests accounting and
that the DOJ's investigation of UroCor had not been concluded to the
satisfaction of Dianon.
Based on the recommendation of management, the Dianon
board concluded that the UroCor acquisition should not be pursued.

                                      
I-41

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      On December 6, 2000, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in which Dianon confirmed that Dianon and UroCor were no longer in
negotiations regarding a business combination.

      
On February 16, 2001, UroCor announced that it had reached a tentative
settlement with the Department of Justice regarding the DOJ's investigation into
certain billing claims submitted by UroCor to Medicare and other federal and
state insurance programs.
The settlement was subject to certain judicial and
governmental approvals.

      
On February 20, 2001, the UroCor board met and management reviewed the
status of the company's evaluation of its strategic plan.
During the meeting,
representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray updated the board regarding the
review of the strategic plan including the review of any potential business
combination transactions.

      
During March 2001, representatives of UroCor and U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray identified another list of potential acquirors that might be interested
in a business combination transaction with UroCor.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
subsequently contacted these companies.
Ten of the companies contacted either
executed or were already bound by an existing confidentiality agreement.
These
parties, including Dianon, were subsequently provided with updated financial and
operation information regarding UroCor.

      
On April 3, 2001, UroCor received a preliminary, non-binding indication of
interest from another potential strategic acquiror interested in pursuing a
transaction with UroCor.

      
On April 6, 2001, representatives of Dianon, UroCor, Lazard and U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray held a conference call in which UroCor discussed the
status of the DOJ's investigation of UroCor and updated Dianon on UroCor's
therapeutic and diagnostic businesses.

      
During the week of April 16, 2001, the other potential strategic acquiror
conducted a due diligence review of UroCor in Oklahoma City.

      
On April 17, 2001, Lazard made a presentation to the Dianon board of
directors which reviewed a preliminary valuation analysis in connection with a
potential acquisition of UroCor.
The board authorized Mr. Johnson to negotiate a
letter of preliminary interest in pursuing a business combination with UroCor
for a price of up to $13.00 per UroCor share.

      
On April 19, 2001, the UroCor board met and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
discussed with the board the current status of its work on behalf of UroCor,
including review of potential business combination transactions.
U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray reported to UroCor's board that due primarily to a lack of
strategic fit and UroCor's market value at the time, none of the other companies
contacted were interested in pursuing a potential business combination
transaction.
Subsequent to that discussion, management discussed with the UroCor
board alternatives for UroCor's strategic plan including the review of potential
business combination transactions and other alternatives for growth including
initiating an acquisition strategy for both the company's diagnostic and
therapeutics businesses.
In connection with that discussion, Mr. George noted
current limitations on UroCor with respect to pursuing those strategies, the
need for financing resources in connection with any such strategy and related
matters.

                                      
I-42

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      On April 20, 2001, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
in which Dianon expressed its preliminary interest in again pursuing a business
combination with UroCor.
In the April 20, 2001, letter Dianon proposed an
acquisition price of between $12.00 and $13.00 per share and that approximately
50% of the consideration would be paid in Dianon common stock and the remainder
would be paid in cash.
Finally, the April 20, 2001 letter provided for UroCor to
grant Dianon an exclusive period of 60 days to conduct due diligence of UroCor.

      
After UroCor's receipt of Dianon's April 20, 2001 letter, UroCor's
management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Dianon's management and Lazard
engaged in various discussions regarding the provisions of that letter.

      
On April 26, 2001, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
in which Dianon again expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a business
combination with UroCor.
The April 26, 2001 letter superseded the April 20, 2001
letter.
In the April 26, 2001 letter, Dianon proposed to acquire UroCor at a
price of $13.00 per share.
Dianon proposed that 60% of the consideration would
be in the form of Dianon common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.3662 and
40% of the consideration would be in the form of cash.
Dianon also stated in the
letter that it was prepared to discuss an all-stock transaction.
Finally, in the
April 26, 2001 letter, Dianon reduced the exclusive period for due diligence to
30 days and agreed to permit UroCor to conduct due diligence on Dianon.

      
On May 1, 2001, the UroCor board met and discussed the Dianon letter dated
April 26, 2001.
At that meeting, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray led a discussion
with the UroCor board regarding a potential business combination with Dianon and
the other potential strategic acquiror.
During the meeting, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray reported to the UroCor board that it had received an updated letter from
the other potential strategic acquiror indicating interest in pursuing a
business combination transaction at a price that was higher than its initial
indication, but still below UroCor's current market price.
The UroCor board
discussed this letter with Piper Jaffray and UroCor management and, based on an
evaluation of lesser potential synergies from a combination with that company,
the lower price offered, and the other party's unwillingness to improve upon its
indication, decided not to pursue a transaction with that company at that time.

The UroCor board subsequently discussed with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and
UroCor's management the materials presented regarding a combination transaction
with Dianon, a due diligence investigation of Dianon's business and other
matters.
Following these discussions, the board authorized management to execute
the Dianon April 26, 2001 letter and to conduct a due diligence review of
Dianon.
The UroCor board also directed management to review and report to the
board at the next meeting regarding the results of Dianon's due diligence review
of UroCor, the results of UroCor's due diligence review of Dianon and to discuss
further with the UroCor board the

ONE - THE MERGER

proposed business combination transaction and other alternatives for pursuing
growth of the company and enhancing stockholder value.
Following this UroCor
board meeting, on behalf of UroCor, Mr. George executed the Dianon letter dated
April 26, 2001.

      
During the weeks of May 1, 2001 and May 7, 2001, representatives of
Dianon, Lazard and Cadwalader conducted a due diligence review of UroCor in
Oklahoma City.
Also during this time, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray communicated to
Lazard UroCor's concerns regarding Dianon's proposed acquisition price relative
to UroCor's current stock price.

      
On May 25, 2001, the Dianon board met and discussed the potential
acquisition of UroCor.
During the meeting, representatives of Lazard updated the
board on Lazard's financial analysis of UroCor.
The board of directors of Dianon
authorized Mr. Johnson to increase the offer price in the preliminary indication
of interest up to $15.00 per UroCor share if necessary to continue the exclusive
period for Dianon to negotiate with UroCor.

      
During the week of May 28, 2001, representatives of UroCor and U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray conducted a due diligence review of Dianon at the offices
of Cadwalader in New York City.
On May 31, 2001, Dianon's legal counsel met with
UroCor's legal counsel in Stamford, Connecticut, to discuss the Department of
Justice's investigation of Dianon.

      
On June 1, 2001, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to UroCor in which Dianon again
expressed its preliminary interest in pursuing a business combination with
UroCor.
The June 1, 2001 letter superseded Dianon's April 26, 2001 letter.
In
the June 1, 2001 letter, Dianon offered a fixed exchange ratio of 0.3503 Dianon
shares for each UroCor share, which implied a price of $15.00 per share based on
Dianon's closing price on May 24, 2001.
The June 1, 2001 letter provided for
UroCor to extend the exclusive period to June 8, 2001.
On behalf of UroCor, Mr.
George executed Dianon's June 1, 2001 letter.

      
On June 1, 2001, Cadwalader distributed a draft merger agreement to
representatives of UroCor, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and UroCor's counsel,
Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.

      On June 5, 2001, the UroCor board met and management reported to the board
regarding the current developments in connection with UroCor's discussions with
Dianon regarding a potential business combination transaction.
Management also
reported to the UroCor board regarding UroCor's due diligence investigation of
Dianon including a review of financial matters and the current DOJ investigation
of Dianon and Dianon's regulatory compliance program.
Management also reported
to the UroCor board that management continued to develop strategic plan
alternatives in the event a potential business combination transaction was
determined not to be an appropriate course of action.
Following these
discussions, the UroCor board authorized management to grant Dianon the
exclusive right to continue to conduct a due diligence review of UroCor through
June 21, 2001 and to continue to conduct a due diligence review of Dianon and to
negotiate the proposed definitive terms of a business combination agreement.

      
On June 6, 2001, Mr. Johnson sent a letter to UroCor in which Dianon again
expressed its interest in pursuing a business combination with UroCor.
The June
6, 2001 letter superseded Dianon's June 1, 2001 letter.
The terms of Dianon's
proposal were the same as in the June 1,

                                      I-44

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

2001 letter, except that the June 6, 2001 letter provided for an exclusive
period until June 15, 2001.
On behalf of UroCor, Mr. George executed Dianon's
June 6, 2001 letter.

      
From June 8, 2001 through the week of June 11, 2001, management of Dianon
and UroCor negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and worked with
representatives of Lazard, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Cadwalader and Fulbright
to prepare revised drafts of the merger agreement.

      
On June 15, 2001, Cadwalader distributed to the Dianon board the current

from a financial point of view, (c) Cadwalader summarized the terms of the
current draft of the merger agreement, (d) extensive discussion occurred among
the directors, management and Dianon's advisors regarding the potential
transaction, and (e) after such discussion, the Board authorized management to

potentially increase such exchange ratio if (i) necessary to finalize the
agreement and (ii) management was able to negotiate a limit on the exchange
ratio such that the maximum price paid for each UroCor share would not exceed
$17.00 per share.

      
During the weekend of June 16, 2001, management of Dianon and UroCor
negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and worked with representatives of
Lazard, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Cadwalader and Fulbright to prepare revised
drafts of the merger agreement and the schedules and exhibits thereto.

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      On June 17, 2001, at 7:00 p.m., E.D.T., the Dianon board held a special
telephonic meeting during which the UroCor merger was discussed.
During the
board meeting, (a) Dianon management and representatives of Lazard updated the
board on the status of the negotiations with UroCor, including the proposed
"agreement in principle" that management had reached with UroCor management
regarding an exchange ratio of 0.4064, limited to a maximum value of $17.00 per
share, (b) representatives of Lazard gave their oral opinion that the exchange
ratio of 0.4064 as defined in the merger agreement distributed to the Dianon
board on June 17, 2001 by Cadwalader is fair to Dianon's stockholders from a
financial point of view, (c) discussion occurred among the directors, management
and the Company's advisors regarding the potential transaction, and (d) the
Board authorized management to enter into the merger agreement substantially in
the form distributed to the Board on June 17, 2001 by Cadwalader, with such
changes as management may approve.

      
On the evening of June 17, 2001, following the Dianon board meeting,
Dianon management determined not to proceed with the merger based on its review
of the estimates provided by UroCor of the transaction fees and bonuses that
UroCor would pay in conjunction with the merger.

      
On June 17, 2001 at 9:00 p.m., C.D.T., the UroCor board held a special
telephonic meeting during which the special negotiating committee appointed at
the meeting earlier that morning reported with respect to resolution of the
stock option matters and the review of the appropriateness of the proposed
maximum exchange ratio value of $17.00 per share.
UroCor management also
reported to the board that subsequent to the meeting held earlier that morning
Dianon had notified UroCor's management of Dianon's concern regarding the
estimated amount of the potential transaction fees payable by UroCor in
conjunction with the merger, and the amounts payable after the closing of the
transaction in connection with the change in control agreements entered into
between UroCor and certain employees of the company.
The UroCor board discussed
these matters extensively.
After that discussion, representatives of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray reaffirmed to the UroCor board its oral opinion that, as

DIANON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER


The following discussion of Dianon's reasons for the merger contains a number of
forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Dianon with respect
to future events that may have an effect on the future financial performance of
the combined company.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties.
Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the
results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Cautionary
statements that identify important factors that could cause or contribute to
differences in results and outcomes include those discussed in "Forward Looking
Information" and "Risk Factors.
"

      Dianon believes that a combination of Dianon and UroCor will create a
leading national full-service cancer diagnostics company, with a leading market
share in the urology segment of this market, and with greater diversity, breadth
and financial resources, that will have the opportunity to enhance stockholder
value in ways that are unlikely to be achieved by Dianon or UroCor alone.

Specifically, Dianon believes that the combined company would be uniquely
positioned to realize:

      o     enhanced revenue potential;

      o     significant cost savings;

      o     more comprehensive customer base and strengthened relationship with
            managed care customers;

      o     enhanced technological capabilities;

      o     the benefits of combining Dianon's and UroCor's complementary
            services and products;

      o     Dianon's long term business strategy of adding complementary
            businesses that broaden Dianon's leading laboratory services,
            technology and market presence; and

      o     greater stockholder value.

      
Dianon believes that the acquisition of UroCor by Dianon will result in
the combined company becoming a leader in the growing field of cancer
diagnostics in the country, with more than $180 million of annual revenues,
EBITDA potentially exceeding $45 million, no debt and approximately 12 million
outstanding shares, in each case on a pro forma basis in 2002.

      
The consensus estimates for the combined company for the base business and
the expected long-term earnings per share growth rate is 30% per annum.
The
Dianon board believes that the inherent operating leverage in Dianon's business
will allow for significant selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")
synergies to be realized with the acquisition of UroCor.
Dianon expects the cost
synergies to be completed during the second quarter of 2002, providing $0.07 to
$0.12 earnings per share accretion in 2002.
Further, Dianon anticipates $0.15 to
$0.25

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

earnings per share accretion in 2003.
Dianon expects its cash flow to
significantly strengthen in the near future, with 2002 EBITDA potentially
exceeding $45 million.

      
Dianon and UroCor share common operating philosophies, including the same
strong commitment to technological innovation, diagnostic excellence and
customer service.
In addition, both companies have effective marketing programs
focused on the urology community that, together with Dianon's comprehensive
suite of services to other physician specialties, will strengthen the merged
company's position as a leader in the area of cancer diagnostics.
Dianon
believes that the combined sales teams, comprised of highly experienced,
technically trained representatives, will play a key role in growing the
combined company's business and serving their customers.
Moreover, this
combination will provide synergistic opportunities that will strengthen Dianon's
strategic position and earnings growth opportunity going forward.

      
After the transaction, Dianon will have a more extensive network of
laboratories and a direct sales and marketing presence in all key markets
nationwide.
Dianon expects to generate significant net cost savings through
elimination of redundancies between Dianon and UroCor and sharing of
competencies in core areas.
Dianon's management expects that these net pre-tax
savings will exceed $10 million annually after three years.

      
In addition, Dianon believes that the acquisition of UroCor will:

      o     create a company with a leadership position in cancer diagnostics;

      o     provide Dianon with a complementary market share and geographical
            reach in the urology segment of the diagnostic laboratory market, as
            well as access to more than 5,000 urologists nationwide;

      o     broaden and deepen Dianon's product portfolio;

      o     leverage SG&A infrastructure to drive Dianon's earnings growth;

      o     provide strong cash flow to reinvest in growth opportunities;

      o     increase Dianon's outstanding shares by approximately 50%, promoting
            improved liquidity;

      o     provide Dianon with a competitive advantage in managed care
            contracting environment;

      o     enhance Dianon's growth prospects; and

      o     create one of the largest cancer diagnostic databases.

ONE - THE MERGER

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, AND RECOMMENDATION OF, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DIANON

At its meeting on June 26, 2001, Dianon's board of directors:

      o     determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable
            and fair to, and in the best interests of, Dianon and its
            stockholders; and

      o     recommended that the Dianon stockholders vote FOR the approval of
            the issuance of Dianon common stock in the merger.


In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, Dianon's
board of directors consulted with Dianon's management, as well as its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, and considered the following material
factors:

      (1)   information concerning the financial performance and condition,
            results of operations, asset quality, prospects and businesses of
            each of Dianon and UroCor as separate entities and on a combined
            basis, including:

            o     the revenues of the companies, their complementary businesses
                  and the potential for cost savings and revenue enhancement;

            o     the recent and historical stock price performance of Dianon
                  common stock and UroCor common stock; and

            o     the percentage of the combined company Dianon's stockholders
                  would own following the merger.

      
(2)   the importance of market position, significant scale and scope and
            financial resources to a company's ability to compete effectively in
            the changing environment in the anatomic pathology testing market,
            and the fact that the strategic combination of Dianon's and UroCor's
            businesses would create one of the nation's leading cancer
            diagnostics companies, particularly in the urology segment of the
            this market;

      (3)   the strategic nature of the transaction, which combines Dianon's and
            UroCor's complementary businesses, and creates a broader company
            with enhanced national reach and greater resources, enhanced future
            operating flexibility and increased opportunity for growth;

      (4)   the potential benefits to be derived from a combination of the two
            companies as described under "The Proposed Merger--Our Reasons for
            the Merger", including potential cost savings and efficiencies that
            would result from the merger;

      (5)   the current industry, economic and market conditions and trends,
            including the likelihood of continuing consolidation and increasing
            competition in the medical laboratory industry;

                                      I-50

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      (6)   the nature of existing services and products to be sold by the
            combined company and the fact that the customer base to be served
            will be broader and more diverse;

      (7)   the merger will present the opportunity for the stockholders of
            Dianon to participate in a larger company with a more diversified
            product line and, as stockholders of the combined company, benefit
            from future growth of the combined company;

      (8)   the exchange ratio will enable Dianon stockholders to own
            approximately 65% of the outstanding stock of the combined company;

      (9)   the analyses, presentations and opinion of Lazard to the effect
            that, as of the date of the opinion and subject to the matters set
            out in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial
            point of view to Dianon, which is described below, under "Opinions
            of Financial Advisors--Opinion of Dianon's Financial Advisor";

      (10)  the structure of the transaction as a tax-free reorganization for
            United States federal income tax purposes;

      (11)  the terms of the merger agreement regarding third party proposals,
            including the potential payment by UroCor of a termination fee to
            Dianon, and that the merger is conditioned on certain government
            proceedings relating to UroCor being fully and completely resolved,
            which is discussed under "The Proposed Merger - Certain Litigation";

      (12)  the ability to consummate the merger, including the conditions to
            the merger requiring receipt of necessary regulatory approvals in
            accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;

      (13)  the challenges of combining the businesses of two public companies
            and the risks of diverting management resources for an extended
            period of time;

      (14)  the board of directors' continuing belief in the stockholder value
            opportunity represented by the strategic path the board had
            previously chosen and the unique implementation opportunity
            presented by the definitive transaction terms with UroCor; and

      (15)  the opportunity for Dianon stockholders to vote on the share
            issuance with UroCor.


In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered,
Dianon's board of directors did not find it practicable to and did not quantify,
rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered
in reaching its decision.
The determination was made after consideration of all
of the factors as a whole.
In addition, individual members of Dianon's board of
directors may have given different weights to different factors.

                                      I-51

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

Dianon's board of directors considered all these factors in reaching the
conclusions and recommendations described above.
These factors generally figured
positively, as advantages or opportunities, with the following exceptions:

      o     the factors described in (11), which figured negatively as a
            drawback, but which the Dianon board of directors felt was
            outweighed by the other benefits of the transaction; and

      o     the factor described in (13), which figured negatively as a risk,
            although one which the Dianon board of directors felt could be
            managed successfully by Dianon management.


For additional information concerning the matters discussed, and the conclusions
reached, at various meetings of Dianon's board of directors held between October
13, 2000 and June 26, 2001, see "Background of the Merger".


THE DIANON BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND BELIEVES THAT THE
TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, DIANON AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS.
THE DIANON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF
THE STOCK ISSUANCE PROPOSAL.


FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, AND RECOMMENDATION OF, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UROCOR

At its meeting on June 27, 2001, the UroCor board of directors:

      o     determined that the merger agreement and the merger with Dianon are
            advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, UroCor and its
            stockholders;

      o     approved the merger agreement with Dianon;

      o     directed that the proposed transaction be submitted for
            consideration by the UroCor stockholders; and

      o     recommended that the UroCor stockholders vote FOR adoption of the
            merger and approval of the merger agreement.

      
In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement,
the UroCor board of directors consulted with UroCor's management, as well as its
legal counsel and financial advisors, and considered the following material
factors:

                                      I-52

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      (1)   information concerning the financial performance and condition,
            results of operations, asset quality, prospects and businesses of
            each of Dianon and UroCor as separate entities and on a combined
            basis, including:

            o     the revenues of the companies, their complementary businesses
                  and the potential for cost savings and revenue enhancement;

            o     the recent and historical stock price performance of Dianon
                  common stock and UroCor common stock; and

            o     the percentage of the common stock of Dianon that UroCor
                  stockholders would own following the merger.

      
(2)   the importance of market position, significant scale and scope and
            financial resources to a company's ability to compete effectively in
            the changing environment in the anatomic pathology testing market;

      (3)   the strategic nature of the transaction, which combines Dianon's and
            UroCor's complementary businesses, and creates a broader company
            with enhanced national reach and greater resources, enhanced future
            operating flexibility and increased opportunity for growth;

      (4)   the potential limitations for future growth arising from UroCor's
            focus solely in urology, specifically with respect to the industry
            trend for diagnostic services payors to contract with more
            broad-based providers of these services and the concomitant
            restrictions on UroCor's ability to obtain preferred or exclusive
            contracts with such payors;

      (5)   UroCor's determination that in the absence of a business combination
            transaction, the company's ability to achieve long-term growth would
            require expansion of its business into different disease states,
            such as those in which Dianon already conducts business, and that
            UroCor's ability to achieve such growth would require significant
            capital costs and incurrence of significant financial resources;

      (6)   UroCor's assessment of risks in achieving growth through expanding
            its therapeutic products business;

      (7)   the current industry, economic and market conditions and trends,
            including the likelihood of continuing consolidation and increasing
            competition in the medical laboratory industry;

      (8)   the nature of existing services and products to be sold by the
            combined company and the fact that the customer base to be served
            will be broader and more diverse;

      (9)   the merger will present the opportunity for the stockholders of
            UroCor to participate in a larger company with a more diversified
            product line and, as stockholders of the combined company, benefit
            from future growth of the combined company;

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      (10)  the fact that the exchange ratio (based on Dianon's trading price at
            the close of business on June 27, 2001, the last trading day before
            the execution of the merger agreement was announced) represented a
            premium of 32% over UroCor's 90-day average stock price.

      
(11)  the exchange ratio will enable UroCor stockholders to own
            approximately 35% of the outstanding stock of the combined company;

      (12)  the analyses, presentations and opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper
            Jaffray to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and
            subject to the matters set out in its opinion, the exchange ratio
            was fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders of
            UroCor, which is described below, under "Opinion of Financial
            Advisors -- Opinion of UroCor's Financial Advisor";

      (13)  the structure of the transaction as a tax-free reorganization for
            United States federal income tax purposes;

      (14)  the terms of the merger agreement regarding third party proposals,
            including the potential payment by UroCor of a termination fee to
            Dianon, and that the merger is conditioned on certain government
            proceedings relating to UroCor being fully and completely resolved;

      (15)  the headquarters of the combined company will remain at Stratford,
            Connecticut and Dianon shall maintain a facility at UroCor's former
            headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;

      (16)  the ability to consummate the merger, including the conditions to
            the merger requiring receipt of necessary regulatory approvals in
            accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;

      (17)  the opportunity for UroCor stockholders to vote on the proposed
            merger with Dianon.


THE UROCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE

                              ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
This
method accounts for a business combination as the acquisition of one entity by
another.

            organization;

      o     a dealer or broker in securities;

      o     a stockholder that holds its UroCor common stock as part of a hedge,
            appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction;
            or

      o     a stockholder that acquired its UroCor common stock pursuant to the
            exercise of options or otherwise as compensation.

      
Tax Opinions.
Dianon has received an opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham &
Taft, and UroCor has received an opinion of Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.
(together with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, "outside tax counsel"), that the
merger will be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
and that Dianon, Dianon merger subsidiary and UroCor will each be a party to
that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
It is a condition to the obligation of each of Dianon and UroCor to
complete the merger that the relevant outside tax counsel confirm its opinion as
of the closing date.
Neither Dianon nor UroCor intends to waive this condition.

                                      
I-55

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

The opinions of outside tax counsel regarding the merger have relied, and the
opinions regarding the merger as of the closing date (the "closing date
opinions") will each rely, on (1) representations and covenants made by Dianon,
the Dianon merger subsidiary and UroCor, including those contained in
certificates of officers of Dianon, the Dianon merger subsidiary and UroCor, and
(2) specified assumptions, including an assumption regarding the completion of
the merger in the manner contemplated by the merger agreement.
In addition, the
opinions of outside tax counsel have assumed, and outside tax counsel's ability
to provide the closing date opinions will depend on, the absence of changes in
existing facts or in law between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the closing date.
If any of those representations,
covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, either or both outside tax counsel may
not be able to render the required closing date opinions or the tax consequences
of the merger could differ from those discussed here or described in the
opinions that outside tax counsel have delivered.
Opinions of outside tax
counsel neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS or the courts from adopting a
contrary position.
Dianon and UroCor do not intend to obtain a ruling from the
IRS on the tax consequences of the merger.

      
Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger.
The merger will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Dianon, UroCor and the Dianon merger
subsidiary will each be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
None of Dianon, the Dianon merger
subsidiary and UroCor will recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of the merger.

      
Federal Income Tax Consequences to UroCor Stockholders.
For federal income
tax purposes:

      o     A holder of UroCor common stock will not recognize any gain or loss
            upon the exchange of that stockholder's shares of UroCor common
            stock for shares of Dianon common stock in the merger.

      
o     To the extent that a holder of UroCor common stock receives cash
            instead of a fractional share of Dianon common stock, the holder
            will be required to recognize gain or loss, measured by the
            difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of
            the tax basis of that holder's shares of UroCor common stock
            allocable to that fractional share of Dianon common stock.
This gain
            or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
            gain or loss if the holding period for the share of UroCor common
            stock exchanged for the fractional share of Dianon common stock was
            more than one year at the effective time of the merger.

      
o     A holder of UroCor common stock will have a tax basis in the Dianon
            common stock received in the merger equal to (1) the tax basis of
            the UroCor common stock surrendered by that holder in the merger,
            less (2) any tax basis of the UroCor common stock surrendered that
            is allocable to a fractional share of Dianon common stock for which
            cash is received.

                                      I-56

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      o     The holding period for shares of Dianon common stock received in
            exchange for shares of UroCor common stock in the merger will
            include the holding period for the shares of UroCor common stock
            surrendered in the merger.

      
Federal Income Tax Consequences to Dianon Stockholders.
There will be no
federal income tax consequences to a holder of Dianon capital stock as a result
of the merger.


This discussion is intended to provide only a general summary of the material
federal income tax consequences of the merger, and is not a complete analysis or
description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger.
This
discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are
contingent on, individual circumstances.
In addition, it does not address any
non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger.

ACCORDINGLY, WE STRONGLY URGE EACH STOCKHOLDER OF UROCOR TO CONSULT HIS OR HER
TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR
FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THAT STOCKHOLDER OF THE MERGER.

                    
REGULATORY MATTERS RELATING TO THE MERGER

Neither Dianon nor UroCor are required to obtain any material regulatory
consents or approvals to conclude the merger.
Although Dianon and UroCor are not
required to file notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust
grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is made, that it would not be
successful.
Federal and state antitrust authorities and private parties in
certain circumstances may bring legal action under the antitrust laws seeking to
enjoin the merger or seeking conditions.

                               
NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Holders of UroCor common stock do not have dissenters' appraisal rights under
Delaware law that would give them the right to obtain the payment of cash in
exchange for their UroCor common stock as a result of the merger.
Holders of
Dianon common stock are also not entitled to dissenters' appraisal rights under
Delaware law in connection with the merger.

                               
CERTAIN LITIGATION

UroCor announced on June 29, 2001, that it had received final judicial and
governmental approvals of a tentative settlement agreement with the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ") previously announced on February 16, 2001
concerning matters covered by the DOJ's investigation into actions of UroCor
during 1992 through 1998 in connection with billing claims submitted by UroCor
to Medicare and other federal and state insurance programs for its diagnostics
testing services.
Under the final settlement agreement, UroCor refunded the
various programs a total of $9.0 million.
The settlement covers UroCor
liabilities to the federal government and state insurance programs with respect
to the matters under investigation through December 31, 2000.
Under the terms of
the settlement, there was no admission by UroCor of any wrongdoing in connection
with matters covered by the investigation.
UroCor also has agreed to operate
under a corporate integrity agreement for a period of up to five years.
Among

                                      I-57

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

other things, the corporate integrity agreement requires UroCor to cooperate
with the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Oklahoma in
connection with a criminal investigation related to the DOJ investigation.
In
addition, UroCor has incurred and expects to continue to incur expenses relating
to the DOJ investigation, including without limitation, the administration of
the DOJ settlement (including compliance with the corporate integrity
agreement), and may incur additional expenses in connection with any related
governmental investigations or proceedings (including the criminal
investigation) and any potential indemnification of legal and other fees and
costs for current and past directors, officers and employees of UroCor.
UroCor
currently estimates that it could incur up to $6 million of these potential
indemnification expenses.

   
FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; STOCK TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENTS

This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of the Dianon
common stock to be received by the stockholders of UroCor upon completion of the
merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.


All shares of Dianon common stock received by UroCor stockholders in the merger
will be freely transferable, except that shares of Dianon common stock received
by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates" of UroCor under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, at the time of the UroCor special meeting may be resold by
them only in transactions permitted by Rule 145 under the 1933 Act or as
otherwise permitted under the 1933 Act.
Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates of UroCor for such purposes generally include individuals or entities
that control, are controlled by or are under common control with UroCor, as the
case may be, and include directors and executive officers of UroCor.
The merger
agreement requires that UroCor use reasonable efforts to cause each of such
affiliates to execute a written agreement to the effect that such persons will
not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Dianon common stock
issued to them in the merger in violation of the 1933 Act or the related SEC
rules.

LAZARD'S

THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY A
SUMMARY OF THE LAZARD OPINION.
STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE ENTIRE
OPINION.

      
In the course of performing its review and analysis for rendering its
opinion, Lazard, among other things:

      -     reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;

      -     analyzed certain historical business and financial information
            relating to Dianon and UroCor;

      -     reviewed financial projections for Dianon that were not provided by
            Dianon but were contained in certain securities analysts' research
            reports that were recommended for review by management of Dianon;

      -     reviewed various financial forecasts and other data relating to
            UroCor's business provided to us by management of UroCor and by
            management of Dianon;

      -     held discussions with members of the senior management of Dianon and
            UroCor with respect to the businesses and prospects of Dianon and
            UroCor, respectively, the strategic objectives of each, and possible
            benefits which might be realized following the merger;

      -     reviewed the synergistic savings and benefits and the timing of
            their occurrence as projected by Dianon to be realized by the
            combined entities in connection with the merger;

                                      I-59

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

      -     reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies
            in lines of business Lazard believed to be generally comparable to
            the business of Dianon and UroCor;

      -     reviewed the historical stock prices and trading volumes of Dianon
            common stock and UroCor common stock; and

      -     conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations
            as were deemed appropriate.

      
Lazard relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information
publicly available or reviewed by or discussed with Lazard.
Lazard did not
assume any responsibility for any independent verification of such information
or any independent valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities of Dianon
or UroCor, or concerning the solvency of, or issues relating to solvency
concerning, Dianon or UroCor.
With respect to financial forecasts, including the
synergistic savings and benefits projected to be realized following the merger
and the timing thereof, and other information that were provided to or discussed
with Lazard, Lazard assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on the best
currently available estimates and judgments of Dianon and UroCor as to the
future financial performance of Dianon and UroCor.
Lazard assumed no
responsibility for and expressed no view as to such forecasts or the assumptions
on which they were based.

      
Lazard also assumed, with Dianon's consent, that the merger would be
completed according to the terms of the merger agreement, without waiver of any
material term or condition contained in that agreement, and that the merger
would be accounted for as a purchase under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Lazard also assumed that the synergistic savings and
benefits of the merger projected by the management of Dianon would be realized
both in scope and timing and that the governmental investigation of UroCor (and
all related claims) relating to claims submitted by UroCor to Medicare and other
federal health care programs had been resolved on terms that would not adversely
effect the value of UroCor.
In addition, Lazard assumed that obtaining the
necessary regulatory approvals for the merger would not have an adverse effect
on Dianon and UroCor.

      
Lazard was not asked to consider, and Lazard's opinion did not address,
the relative merits of the merger, any alternative potential transactions or the
company's underlying decision to effect the merger.
Lazard also noted that its
opinion was necessarily based upon information available, and economic,
monetary, stock market and other conditions existing and disclosed, to Lazard as
of the date of its opinion.

      
The following is a brief summary of the material financial and comparative
analyses which Lazard deemed to be appropriate for this type of transaction and
that were performed by Lazard in connection with rendering its opinion.

      
Contribution Analysis.
Lazard performed a contribution analysis in order
to evaluate the percentage contribution of each of Dianon and UroCor to the
combined company on a pro forma basis.
Lazard calculated the relative
contribution by both Dianon and UroCor to the

                                      I-60

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

combined company with respect to certain projected financial data for Dianon and
UroCor, including revenues, EBITDA, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
and net income, as set forth below.
Lazard performed two separate contribution
analyses, one of which was based on the projected financial data for UroCor
provided by management of UroCor and the other was based on the projected
financial data for UroCor provided by management of Dianon taking into account
the synergies projected by Dianon's management to result from the merger.

      Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
Lazard performed three separate discounted
cash flow analyses in order to derive ranges of implied per share values for
UroCor common stock based on the present value of expected future cash flows of
UroCor.
The first discounted cash flow analysis was based on financial forecasts
for UroCor as a stand-alone entity provided by the management of UroCor.
This
analysis, which did not take into account potential synergies, was based on a
range of terminal multiples of EBITDA of 12.0x to 16.0x and a range of discount
rates from 10% to 12% for UroCor's diagnostic business and a range of terminal
multiples of EBITDA of 7.0x to 11.0x and a range of discount rates of 10% to 12%
for UroCor's therapeutics business.
Using this analysis, Lazard derived a range
of implied per share values of $22.13 to $31.39 for UroCor common stock.
The
second discounted cash flow analysis was based on financial forecasts for UroCor
as a stand-alone entity provided by management of Dianon.
This analysis, which
did not take into account potential synergies, was based on a range of terminal
multiples of EBITDA of 12.0x to 16.0x and a range of discount rates of 10% to
12%.
Using this analysis, Lazard derived a range of implied per share values of
$9.53 to $12.70 for UroCor common stock.
The third discounted cash flow analysis
was based on the information derived in the second analysis but also took into
account the potential synergies estimated by Dianon's management to result from
the merger.
The discounted cash flow analysis of the synergies was based on a
range of perpetual growth rates of -2.5% to 2.5% and a range of discount rates
of 10% to 12%.
The forecasts for synergies assumed net synergies, including
costs to achieve such synergies, of $-8.5 million in 2001, $16.8 million in 2002
and $17.7 million thereafter.
Using this analysis, Lazard derived a range of
implied per share values, including the value of net synergies, of $15.84 to
$23.90 for UroCor common stock.

      Premiums Paid Analysis.
Lazard performed a premiums paid analysis based on
premiums paid in the following transactions that involved U.S. healthcare
companies and that had transaction values that ranged from $100 million to $500
million and were announced during the two year period prior to the announcement
of the merger:

1 Month Before       (6.8%)      43.1%       40.0%      73.5%

      Using the range of premiums paid in the foregoing precedent transactions,
Lazard derived a range of implied per share values of $14.90 to $26.17 for the
UroCor common stock.

      
Comparable Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.
Lazard performed a
comparable public companies analysis based on financial multiples of selected
comparable companies in the diagnostic laboratories industry in order to derive
a range of implied per share values for UroCor common stock.
In performing this
analysis, Lazard reviewed certain financial information for UroCor and compared
such information to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for four (4) other diagnostic laboratory companies Lazard
deemed to be comparable to UroCor, based on similarities in diagnostic services
provided, information services provided, customer base, payer mix, geographic
presence and technology.
The companies included in this analysis were:

      o     Ameripath, Inc.

      o     Impath, Inc.

      o     Laboratory Corporation of America

      o     Quest Diagnostics, Inc.

      Using publicly available information, Lazard calculated the enterprise
value of each of these comparable companies as a multiple of their respective
calendar 2001 estimated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA):

                            LOW      MEDIAN      MEAN       HIGH

2001E EBITDA               12.7x      13.3x      13.7x      14.9x

      Using the multiples calculated in the comparable publicly traded
companies' analysis and based on the financial forecasts for UroCor prepared by
management of Dianon, Lazard derived a range of implied per share values of
$6.45 to $7.30 for UroCor common stock.

      Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
Lazard reviewed the implied exchange
ratio of shares of UroCor Common Stock to shares of Dianon Common Stock based on
the closing prices of the shares from June 15, 2000 to June 15, 2001.

      
The following table illustrates the implied exchange ratio on the dates or
for the periods indicated:

      Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses solely
for the purpose of providing its opinion to the Dianon board of directors that
the exchange ratio to be offered in the merger is fair to Dianon from a
financial point of view.
The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to a partial analysis
or summary description.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate analyses
summarized above, Lazard believes that its analyses must be considered as a
whole and that selecting portions of the analyses or factors considered by it,
without considering all such factors or analyses, or attempting to ascribe
relative weights to some or all such analyses and factors could create an
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the Lazard opinion.

      
In its analyses, Lazard made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Dianon and UroCor.
The
estimates contained in these analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from
any particular analysis do not necessarily indicate actual values or predict
future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those suggested by these analyses.
Lazard did not assign any specific weight to
any of the analyses described above and did not draw any specific conclusions
from or with regard to any one method of analysis.
In addition, analyses
relating to the value of the businesses or securities are not appraisals and do
not reflect the prices at which the businesses or securities may actually be
sold or the prices at which their securities may trade.
As a result, these
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

      
No company or transaction used in any of the analyses is identical to
Dianon, UroCor, or the merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
foregoing necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics of Dianon and UroCor and other factors
that could affect the public trading values or the announced merger transaction
values, as the case may be, of the companies to which they are being compared.

Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or median) is not in itself
a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data or comparable company
data.

      
Lazard's opinion and financial analyses were not the only factors
considered by the Dianon board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and
should not be viewed as

                                      I-65

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

determinative of the views of the Dianon board of directors or Dianon's
management.
Lazard has consented to the inclusion of and references to its
opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

      
Under the terms of Lazard's engagement, Dianon has agreed to pay Lazard an
advisory fee of approximately $4 million.
A substantial portion of this fee will
not be paid unless and until the merger is completed.
Dianon has agreed to
reimburse Lazard for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
performing its services, including the fees and expenses of its legal counsel.

In addition, Dianon agreed to indemnify Lazard against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws relating to or arising
out of Lazard's engagement.

      
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged
buyouts, and valuations for real estate, corporate and other purposes.
In the
ordinary course of its business, Lazard and its affiliates may from time to time
effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities, of
Dianon or UroCor for its own account and for the account of Lazard's customers.

Lazard was selected to act as investment banker to Dianon because of its
expertise and its reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions
and a strong presence in the healthcare industry.


OPINION OF UROCOR'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., UroCor's financial advisor, has rendered a
written opinion, dated June 27, 2001, to the UroCor board of directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of UroCor common stock of
the exchange ratio in the merger.
The full text of the written opinion of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray is attached to this document as Annex C.
We encourage you
to read the opinion carefully in its entirety to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in providing their opinion.
THE OPINION
OF U.S. BANCORP PIPER JAFFRAY IS DIRECTED TO THE UROCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ANY STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO ANY
MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER.

      
UroCor retained U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to act as the exclusive
financial advisor of the UroCor board of directors in connection with the merger
and to render to the UroCor board of directors an opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock of UroCor of the
exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement.

      
On June 27, 2001, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered to the UroCor board
of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, as of that
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors, and limitations
stated in the written opinion and described below, that the exchange ratio set
forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of common stock of UroCor.
A copy of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's
written opinion is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C and is
incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.
The UroCor
stockholders should read the opinion carefully in its entirety in conjunction
with the proxy statement/prospectus and should carefully consider

                                      I-66

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

the assumptions made, matters considered and the limits of the review undertaken
by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's written opinion,
which was directed to the UroCor board of directors, addresses only the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of UroCor common stock
of the proposed exchange ratio.
The opinion does not address UroCor's underlying
business decision to participate in the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any UroCor stockholder as to how a stockholder should vote
with respect to the merger at UroCor's special meeting of stockholders.

      
In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion was one of many factors
taken into consideration by the UroCor board of directors in its evaluation of
the proposed merger.
Consequently, the analyses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
described below should not be viewed as determinative of the views of UroCor's
management with respect to the proposed exchange ratio or the merger.
U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed that the structure, the amount of consideration,
and other terms of the merger are the most beneficial terms from UroCor's
perspective that could, under the circumstances, be negotiated among the
parties, and expressed no opinion as to whether any alternative transaction
might be more favorable to UroCor.

      
In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed, among
other things:

      o     a draft of the merger agreement dated June 27, 2001 and drafts of
            other documents related to the merger;

      o     selected publicly available financial, operating and business
            information related to UroCor and Dianon;

      o     publicly available market and securities data of UroCor and Dianon
            and selected public companies deemed comparable to UroCor and
            Dianon;

      o     to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to
            selected merger and acquisition transactions deemed comparable to
            the proposed merger; and

      o     internal financial information of UroCor and Dianon prepared for
            financial planning purposes and furnished to U.S. Bancorp Piper
            Jaffray by management of UroCor and Dianon.

      
In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray engaged in discussions with
members of the senior management of UroCor and Dianon regarding the business and
prospects of their respective companies and the joint prospects of a combined
company.

      
For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon and
assumed the accuracy, completeness and fairness of the financial statements and
other information provided to it by UroCor and Dianon or otherwise made
available to it and did not assume responsibility for the independent
verification of that information.
Information prepared for financial planning
purposes was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure.
U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon the assurances of the management of UroCor and
Dianon that the information provided to it by UroCor and Dianon was prepared on
a reasonable basis, the financial planning data and other business outlook
information reflect the best currently available estimates of management, and
management was not aware of any information or facts that would make the

                                      I-67

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

information provided to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray incomplete or misleading.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also assumed that there had been no material changes
in UroCor's and Dianon's assets, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects since the respective dates of their last financial
statements made available to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

      
In delivering its opinion to the UroCor board of directors on June 27,
2001, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray presented to the UroCor board of directors
various analyses and other information material to the opinion.
The following is
a summary of these analyses:

certain publicly available financial, operating and stock market information for
UroCor with similar

                                      I-68

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

information for the following selected publicly held companies, each of which is
involved in the clinical diagnostic and anatomic pathology laboratory segments
of the health care services market:

      o     AmeriPath, Inc.;

      o     DIANON Systems, Inc.;

      o     Dynacare, Inc.;

      o     IMPATH, Inc.;

      o     Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings;

      o     Quest Diagnostics, Inc;

      o     Specialty Laboratories, Inc.; and

      o     UNILAB Corporation.


U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated enterprise value, which it defined as
equity market value plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents, relative to each
company's latest 12 months revenue, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, and earnings
before interest and taxes, commonly referred to as EBIT.
U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray also calculated share price relative to each company's latest 12 months
earnings per share and estimated calendar year 2001 and 2002 earnings per share,
commonly referred to as EPS, estimates.
All multiples were based on closing
stock prices on June 27, 2001.
EPS estimates for the selected companies were
based on estimates as reported by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System,
commonly referred to as IBES, and EPS estimates for UroCor were based on the
internal estimates of the management of UroCor.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray then
compared the multiples for the selected companies to the multiples for UroCor
assuming a UroCor common stock price of $16.26 in the merger.
This analysis
indicated multiples of selected valuation data as follows:

The selected transactions were chosen because the target companies were
companies in the clinical diagnostic and anatomic pathology laboratory industry
that, for purposes of this analysis, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray considered
generally comparable to UroCor.
Each transaction had a transaction value of
greater than $25 million and involved a purchase of a majority interest in the
target company with cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
No
transaction used in the selected transaction analysis is identical to the
merger.
All multiples were based on available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant transaction.

      PREMIUM PAID ANALYSIS.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed the range of
premiums paid in 30 change-of-control transactions of healthcare services
companies with transaction values greater than $25 million completed from
January 1, 1998 to June 27, 2001.
These transactions indicated a range of
premiums based on the target company's stock price one week prior and a four
weeks prior to announcement of the transaction.
The following table sets forth
the median, mean, high and low premiums paid in these transactions as compared
to the premium to be paid in the merger based on a UroCor common stock price of
$16.26.

                                      
UROCOR           SELECTED PREMIUMS

     announcement .................     2.1%    33.1%    40.4%    116.7%   -0.3%

      
This analysis also noted that the premium paid in the merger represented a
30.0% premium over UroCor's stock price on May 1, 2001, three days after UroCor
announced its first quarter financial results, and an 85.8% premium over
UroCor's stock price on February 21, 2001, three days after UroCor announced its
tentative settlement with the Department of Justice.

      DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a
discounted cash flow analysis for UroCor to estimate the present value of the
stand-alone, unleveraged,

                                      I-70

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

after-tax free cash flows that UroCor could generate through December 31, 2005
based on estimates provided by the management of UroCor.
The stand-alone
discounted cash flow analysis was determined by adding the present value at June
30, 2001 of the projected free cash flows generated by UroCor over the period
from July 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005, the present value of UroCor's
estimated terminal value in 2005 and UroCor's cash at March 31, 2001, and
subtracting UroCor's total debt, including accruals for the cost of UroCor's
settlement with the Department of Justice, on March 31, 2001.
The range of
estimated terminal values for UroCor was calculated by applying terminal value
multiples ranging from 8.0x to 10.0x to the projected 2005 EBITDA of UroCor.
The
cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present value using discount
rates ranging from 20.0% to 30.0%.
This analysis yielded an implied equity
reference range for UroCor common stock of $10.15 to $16.03 per share, as
compared to a UroCor common stock price of $16.26 in the merger.

      
CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the pro forma
relative contribution of UroCor to the estimated revenues, EBITDA and pre-tax
income of the combined company in calendar years 2000, 2001 and 2002 based on
estimates provided by the management of UroCor and, with respect to and as
directed by Dianon, estimates from a CS First Boston research report.
This
analysis indicated the following:

      o     for calendar year 2000, UroCor would have contributed approximately
            35.5% of the revenues, 31.1% of the EBITDA and 28.0% of the pre-tax
            income of the pro forma combined company;

      o     in calendar year 2001, UroCor would have contributed approximately
            34.7% of the revenues, 35.3% of the EBITDA and 31.3% of the pre-tax
            income of the pro forma combined company; and

      o     in calendar year 2002, UroCor would have contributed approximately
            34.1% of the revenues, 36.9% of the EBITDA and 34.3% of the pre-tax
            income of the pro forma combined company.

      
Based on the exchange ratio and Dianon's stock price on June 27, 2001,
current holders of UroCor common stock would own approximately 35.4% of the
equity of the pro forma combined company upon completion of the merger.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray presented the recent

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also presented graphs illustrating Dianon'
daily and weekly stock price and volume performance of Dianon over the prior 12
month and three year period.

      
The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to the UroCor board of directors or
the financial analyses performed and factors considered by U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in connection with its opinion.
In reaching its conclusion as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not rely on any
single analysis or factor described above, assign relative weights to the
analyses or factors considered by it, or make any conclusion as to how the
results of any given analysis, taken alone, supported its opinion.
The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances, and, therefore, fairness opinions are not readily susceptible to
summary description.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses and
the summary set forth above must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses, without considering all analyses, or selecting
portions of the above summary, without considering all factors and analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its
analyses and opinion.

      
In performing its analyses, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of UroCor and Dianon.
No company, transaction or business used in the
analyses as a comparison is identical to UroCor, the pro forma combined company
or the proposed merger, nor is an evaluation of the results of the analyses
entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, businesses or transactions being analyzed.
The estimates contained in
the analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses.
In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold.
Accordingly, the analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

      
For purposes of rendering its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed,
in all respects material to its analysis, that:

      o     the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially
            similar to the last draft it reviewed, without modification or
            waiver of material terms or conditions by UroCor or Dianon;

      o     the representations and warranties of UroCor, Dianon and UroCor
            Acquisition Corp. contained in the merger agreement are true and
            correct;

      o     UroCor, Dianon and UroCor Acquisition Corp. will each perform all of
            the covenants and agreements to be performed by it under the merger
            agreement; and

                                      I-72

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      o     all conditions to the obligations of each of UroCor, Dianon and
            UroCor Acquisition Corp. to complete the merger will be satisfied
            without waiver of any of these conditions.


U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also assumed that all regulatory approvals and
consents required in connection with the completion of the merger will be
obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect UroCor or Dianon.
U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray further assumed that neither UroCor nor Dianon is party to
any pending transactions, including any external financing, recapitalization,
acquisition or merger, other than the merger or in the ordinary course of
business.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray further assumed that no transactions in
securities of UroCor or Dianon will occur before the closing date of the merger
or as a result of the merger.
In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed
that the merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax purposes
and will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes.

      
In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not perform any
appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities of UroCor or
Dianon, and was not furnished with any such appraisals or valuations.
U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to the liquidation value of any
entity.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to the price at which
shares of UroCor or Dianon common stock have traded or at which the shares of
UroCor, Dianon or the combined company may trade at any future time.
The opinion
is based on information available to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and the facts
and circumstances as they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of
the opinion.
Events occurring after that date could materially affect the
assumptions used in preparing the opinion.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray has not
undertaken to and is not obligated to affirm or revise its opinion or otherwise
comment on any events occurring after the date it was given.

      
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm and, as a customary part of its investment banking business, is
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.
UroCor selected U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray to serve as its exclusive financial advisor based on U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray's reputation, expertise and experience in similar
transactions.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray regularly publishes research reports
regarding the health care industry and publicly owned companies in the health
care industry.
In the ordinary course of business, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
may actively trade or hold the securities and other instruments and obligations
of UroCor or Dianon for its own account and the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities,
instruments or obligations.

      
Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated July 13, 2000, as amended as of June
17, 2001, between UroCor and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, UroCor agreed to pay
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a retainer fee of $100,000 and $500,000 for rendering
its opinion, both of which amounts will be credited against a $4,000,000
transaction fee payable upon completion of the merger.
In addition, UroCor has
agreed to reimburse U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, and to
indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and certain related parties against certain
liabilities incurred, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws, relating to, or arising out of the engagement of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray by the UroCor board of directors.

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

                   INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER


In considering the recommendations of UroCor's board of directors with respect
to the merger, stockholders should be aware that some officers of UroCor,
including one officer who also is a director, have some interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders of
UroCor.
The board of directors of UroCor was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in making their recommendation.
See
Chapter Five, entitled "Other Dianon Annual Meeting Proposals," for a discussion
of the compensation, including unvested options, none of which vest upon
completion of the merger, and security ownership of the executive officers and
directors of Dianon.


UROCOR'S ARRANGEMENTS WITH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES

      Change In Control Agreements.
Michael W. George and the other executive
officers and key employees listed in the table below, have executed
substantially identical Change in Control Agreements with UroCor, which provide
certain benefits in the event of a change in control of UroCor.
Stockholder
approval of the merger will constitute a "change in control" under these Change
in Control Agreements.

      
Under the terms of these Change in Control Agreements, in the event the
employee is terminated at any time after a change in control transaction has
occurred, and termination is not voluntary or the result of death, permanent
disability, retirement or certain other defined circumstances, the employee
would be entitled to receive (a) payment of accrued but unpaid base salary and
earned but unused vacation time through the date of termination, (b) a lump sum
cash payment equal to either one or one and one-half times the sum of the annual
base salary of the employee in effect at any time since the effective date of
the agreement plus the amount of the highest annual bonus received by the
employee at any time after the effective date of the agreement (excluding any
bonus received under the UroCor 2001 Bonus Plan discussed below) and (c) the
continuation of life, disability and health insurance coverages for either 12 or
18 months.
The Change in Control Agreements also provide special payments to the
employees to reimburse them, if necessary, for any federal excise tax or similar
state or local tax that may be imposed on payments following a change in
control.

      
As of July 31, 2001, the approximate value of the lump sum cash payments
described in (b) above plus earned but unused vacation time described in (a)
above due under these change in control agreements to each employee upon a
qualifying termination of employment following a change in control, not
including any payments that may be made with respect to any excise tax, would be
as follows:

Pursuant to the terms of UroCor's equity-based compensation
plans, all unvested options to purchase UroCor stock held by UroCor's employees,
including executive officers, will become vested and exercisable upon completion
of the merger.


As of July 31, 2001, the number of unvested options held by executive officers

OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK; STOCK OPTIONS

As of June 26, 2001, directors and executive officers of Dianon beneficially
owned an aggregate of 2,294,023 shares of Dianon common stock, including options
to purchase 414,506 shares of Dianon common stock exercisable within 60 days.


As of July 31, 2001, directors and executive officers of UroCor owned an

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

Dianon is obligated, for six years after the merger, to maintain in effect
UroCor's current directors' and officers' liability insurance (but the annual
premiums for such insurance may not exceed $240,000) covering acts or omissions
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger.


Dianon will cause the surviving corporation in the merger to maintain in its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws for a period of 6 years the current
provisions regarding indemnification of officers, directors and employees.

                                      
I-76

                              
THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement.
This
summary does not purport to describe all the terms of the merger agreement and
is qualified by the complete merger agreement which is attached as Annex A to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference.
All
stockholders of Dianon and UroCor are urged to read the merger agreement
carefully and in its entirety.


GENERAL

      Under the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dianon will merge
with and into UroCor, with UroCor continuing as the surviving corporation.
The
merger will be accounted for as a purchase transaction and is structured to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization.


CLOSING MATTERS

      Closing.
Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the merger
will take place on the first business day after all closing conditions have been
satisfied or waived, unless the merger agreement has been terminated or another
time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties.
See "--Conditions" below
for a more complete description of the conditions that must be satisfied prior
to closing.

      
Effective Time.
As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the merger, Dianon and UroCor will file a certificate of
merger in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and make all other
required filings or recordings.
The merger will become effective when the
certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such
subsequent time as Dianon and UroCor agree and specify in the certificate of
merger.


CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

      
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger,
each share of UroCor common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, together with the associated rights issued
under the UroCor stockholder rights plan, will be converted into the right to
receive the shares of Dianon common stock and associated rights at the following
exchange ratio:

      
o     If the Dianon "market price" is less than or equal to $44.29, the
            exchange ratio shall equal 0.4064; and

      o     If the Dianon "market price" is greater than $44.29, the exchange
            ratio shall equal a quotient (rounded to four decimal points), the
            numerator of which is $18.00, and the denominator of which is the
            Dianon market price

      The Dianon "market price" shall mean the average daily closing price per
share of Dianon common stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the "random trading
days."
"Random trading days" means the five trading days selected by lot out of
the fifteen trading days ending on

                                      I-77

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

and including the "determination date" (with "random trading days" selected by
lot by Dianon and UroCor at 5:00 p.m. New York time on the "determination
date"), and "determination date" means the third Nasdaq trading day preceding
the closing date of the merger.

      
In addition, any shares of UroCor common stock owned by Dianon, held by
UroCor as treasury stock or owned by any of their respective subsidiaries will
be automatically canceled, and will not be exchanged for any shares of Dianon
common stock or other consideration.

      
Each share of Dianon common stock will remain outstanding following the
merger and will continue to represent one share of common stock of Dianon after
the merger.


TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

      
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger,
each outstanding and unexercised option or right to purchase shares of UroCor
common stock granted under the UroCor stock plans will be assumed by Dianon and
converted into an option or a right to purchase shares of Dianon common stock
under the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the options as granted
under the UroCor stock plans.
Options or rights to purchase shares of UroCor
common stock granted under the UroCor 1992 stock plan, whether vested or
unvested, will be assumed by Dianon and converted into fully vested options or
rights to purchase shares of Dianon common stock under the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the options as granted under the UroCor stock
plans.
The number of shares of Dianon common stock that the converted options
will be exercisable for, and the exercise price of the option, will be adjusted
to reflect the exchange ratio.

      
To the extent permitted by law, Dianon will comply with the terms of the
UroCor stock plans and will take reasonable steps to ensure that the stock
options which qualified as incentive stock options prior to the completion of
the merger continue to qualify as incentive stock options of Dianon after the
merger.

      
For a further discussion of the treatment of UroCor stock options and
other employee benefit plans under the merger agreement, see "The Merger
Agreement--Covenants" and "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger".


EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES IN THE MERGER

      Before the closing of the merger, Dianon will appoint an exchange agent to
handle the exchange of UroCor stock certificates for stock certificates of
Dianon and the payment of cash for fractional shares.
Soon after the closing of
the merger, the exchange agent will send a letter of transmittal, which is to be
used to exchange UroCor stock certificates for stock certificates of Dianon, to
each former UroCor stockholder.
The letter of transmittal will contain
instructions explaining the procedure for surrendering UroCor stock
certificates.
You should not return certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

      
UroCor stockholders who surrender their stock certificates, together with
a properly completed letter of transmittal, will receive uncertificated,
book-entry shares of Dianon common stock into which the shares of UroCor common
stock were converted in the merger.

                                      I-78

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      After the merger, each certificate that previously represented shares of
UroCor stock will only represent the right to receive the shares of Dianon
common stock into which those shares of UroCor common stock have been converted.

      
Dianon will not pay any dividends or any other distributions to holders of
any UroCor stock certificates until the UroCor stock certificates are
surrendered to the exchange agent.
However, once those certificates are
surrendered, Dianon will pay to the holder, without interest, any dividends that
have been declared after the effective date of the merger on the shares into
which those UroCor shares have been converted.

      
After the effective time of the merger, UroCor will not register any
transfers of the shares of UroCor common stock.

      
Dianon stockholders do not need to exchange their stock certificates.


FRACTIONAL SHARES

      No fractional shares of Dianon common stock will be issued in the merger.

Instead, the exchange agent will pay each of those stockholders who would have
otherwise been entitled to a fractional share of Dianon common stock an amount
in cash determined by multiplying the fractional share interest by the closing
price for a share of Dianon stock on the Nasdaq on the date of the effective
time of the merger or, if such date is not a business day, on the business day
immediately following the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs.


LISTING OF DIANON STOCK

      Dianon has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
Dianon common stock to be issued in the merger and the shares of Dianon common
stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of the UroCor stock options to
be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq, prior to the closing date.


COVENANTS

      We have each undertaken certain covenants in the merger agreement
concerning the conduct of our respective businesses between the date the merger
agreement was signed and the completion of the merger.
The following summarizes
the more significant of these covenants:

      No Solicitation.
UroCor has agreed that neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of UroCor or its subsidiaries
shall, (and UroCor shall cause its employees, agents and representatives not
to), directly or indirectly:

      o     initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate, including by
            way of furnishing information, any inquiries or the making of any
            proposal or offer with respect to a third party "acquisition
            proposal" of the type described below;

      o     have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or
            data to any person relating to an acquisition proposal;

                                      I-79

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

      o     engage in negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal;

      o     knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
            acquisition proposal; or

      o     accept an acquisition proposal.

      
However, UroCor is permitted, as is contemplated under the federal
securities laws, to take and disclose to its stockholders its position with
respect to any acquisition proposal.

      
In addition, UroCor is permitted to provide information to or enter into
negotiations with a third party in response to an acquisition proposal that the
UroCor board of directors determines is reasonably likely to result in a
"superior proposal," if, prior to the UroCor stockholder meeting, a majority of
the UroCor board of directors determines in good faith that a failure to do so
would result in a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
law.
In addition, before UroCor provides information to, or enters into
negotiations with, a third party, it must provide notice to Dianon and enter
into a customary confidentiality agreement with the person making the
acquisition proposal.

      
An "acquisition proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person or entity other than Dianon relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of more than 10% of the total assets (including without
limitation stock of any subsidiaries) of UroCor and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or any shares of any class or series of equity securities of UroCor or
any of its subsidiaries constituting more than 10% of the outstanding shares of
UroCor common stock, any tender offer or exchange offer involving more than 10%
of the outstanding shares of UroCor common stock, or any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving UroCor or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

      
A "superior proposal" means any written proposal not solicited in breach
of the "no-solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement by UroCor made by a
third party to consummate a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation
or similar transaction which would result in such third party (or its
stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the
shares of UroCor common stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a
merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of UroCor and its subsidiaries
and otherwise on terms which a majority of the members of the board of directors
of UroCor determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
taking into consideration the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to UroCor's stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the merger.
In reaching such good faith
determination, the board of directors of UroCor shall give significant
consideration to whether such third party proposal includes definitive financing
and is reasonably capable of being consummated.

                                      I-80

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      UroCor Board of Directors' Covenant to Recommend.

      
UroCor's board will recommend that its stockholders approve the
transaction and will not withdraw or modify its recommendation.
However, prior
to the UroCor stockholder meeting, the UroCor board may, subject to payment of
the "termination fee" (See "The Merger Agreement--Termination of Merger
Agreement" for a discussion of the termination fee), change its recommendation
and/or approve another transaction if an unsolicited superior proposal is made
to UroCor, and a majority of the UroCor board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that a failure to do so would result in a
breach of the directors' fiduciary duties to UroCor's stockholders under
applicable law.

      
UroCor is obligated to notify Dianon within 72 hours prior to any change
in recommendation or approval of another transaction by UroCor board.
UroCor may
not enter into a binding agreement for another transaction prior to the third
business day following Dianon's receipt of such written notification.

      
Operations of Dianon and UroCor Pending Closing.
We have each undertaken a
separate covenant that places restrictions on ourselves and our respective
subsidiaries until either the effective time of the merger or the termination of
the merger agreement.
In general, we and our respective subsidiaries are
required to conduct our business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in
all material respects substantially in the same manner as previously conducted
and to use our reasonable efforts to preserve intact our present lines of
business and relationships with third parties.

      
In addition to these mutual covenants, Dianon has certain other interim
covenants, including: o restrictions with respect to the paying or declaring of
any dividends (other than from a subsidiary to its parent);

      o     restrictions on Dianon issuing any securities or options;

      o     restrictions with respect to amending its governing documents;

      o     actions which would cause its representations and warranties to be
            no longer true;

      o     that Dianon will not and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to
            commit or authorize any of the foregoing actions; and

      o     that Dianon will not take any action that would prevent the merger
            from qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a).

      
In addition to the mutual covenants described above, UroCor has certain
other interim covenants, including:

                                      I-81

            o     restrictions with respect to the paying or declaring of any
                  dividends (other than from a subsidiary to its parent);

            o     restrictions with respect to the issuance of securities and
                  options;

            o     restrictions with respect to amending its governing documents;

            o     restrictions with respect to acquisitions, dispositions,
                  investments, or indebtedness;

            o     a requirement that UroCor not incur or commit capital
                  expenditures above agreed-upon levels;

            o     that UroCor will not pay or discharge any claims or
                  liabilities, or waive any benefits of or fail to enforce any
                  agreement;

            o     that UroCor will not establish, amend or modify any benefit
                  plans or agreements;

            o     that UroCor shall not increase the compensation of any
                  directors, executive officers or employees; however, UroCor
                  may pay up to an aggregate of $1,200,000 under the UroCor 2001
                  Bonus Plan prior to the effective time;

            o     restrictions on transfer or license of any intellectual
                  property;

            o     that UroCor will not enter or amend any of the specified
                  contracts and obligations;

            o     that UroCor will not obtain any real property;

            o     that UroCor will not increase the headcount of employees;

            o     that UroCor shall not change its accounting methods;

            o     that UroCor will not take actions which would cause its
                  representations and warranties to be no longer true;

            o     that UroCor shall not make material tax elections or take any
                  action that would prevent the merger from qualifying as a
                  reorganization under section 368(a); and

            o     that UroCor will not and will not permit any of its
                  subsidiaries from committing or authorizing any of the
                  foregoing actions.

      
Reasonable Efforts Covenant.
We have agreed to cooperate with each other
and to use our reasonable efforts to take all actions and do all things
advisable or necessary under the merger agreement and applicable laws to
complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.
However, neither of us will be required for any reason to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of assets, or to conduct our business in a
specified manner.

      
Employee Matters.

            
o     Prior to the effective time, UroCor may pay up to an aggregate
                  of $1,200,000 under the UroCor 2001 Bonus Plan solely to the
                  employees specified in the merger

                                      I-82

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

                  agreement and thereafter shall, prior to the effective time,
                  terminate such plan.
Dianon may pay such bonus amounts to
                  UroCor employees who continue to be employed by Dianon
                  following the effective time].

            
o     On or before July 1, 2001, UroCor shall take such actions as
                  are necessary to amend the UroCor 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
                  Plan to provide that (a) at the effective time, the offering
                  period under such plan in which the effective time occurs
                  shall expire, (b) no shares of UroCor common stock shall be
                  purchased with respect to such offering period and (c) at the
                  effective time, UroCor shall pay to each participant in such
                  plan in cash an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
                  participant's payroll deduction contributions accumulated
                  during such offering period through the effective time.

the merger.

CONDITIONS

      Our respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the

conditions which include, in addition to other customary closing conditions:

      o     the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger by

            proceeding by any governmental entity, challenging the acquisition
            by Dianon or its merger subsidiary of any shares of UroCor common
            stock, seeking to restrain or prohibit consummation of the merger,
            seeking to place limitations on the ownership of shares of UroCor
            common stock by Dianon, seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership
            or operation by UroCor or Dianon and their respective subsidiaries
            of any material portion of the business or assets of UroCor or
            Dianon and their respective subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to

In addition, individually, our respective obligations to effect the merger
are subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent legally permissible, the
waiver of the following additional conditions:

      o     the representations and warranties of the other company contained in
            the merger agreement being true and correct in all material respects
            on the closing date of the merger as if they were made on that date,
            unless they were by their express provisions made as of another
            particular date, in which case the statement must be true and
            correct in all material respects as of that date;

      o     each party having performed or complied in all material respects
            with its obligations and covenants contained in the merger
            agreement;

      o     the receipt of an opinion of each company's counsel to the effect
            that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under the Internal
            Revenue Code and that each of Dianon, UroCor and the Dianon merger
            subsidiary will be a party to the reorganization;

      o     no event having occurred which would trigger a distribution under
            the other company's stockholder rights plan; and

      o     no event or circumstance shall have occurred relating to any
            governmental review or inquiry concerning any product or business
            practice which is likely to result in a material adverse effect on
            each company or its prospects.


TERMINATION OF MERGER AGREEMENT

      Right to Terminate.
Dianon and UroCor can mutually agree to terminate the
merger agreement without completing the merger, and either party can terminate
the merger agreement if any of the following occurs:

      o     the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001 for reasons
            other than relating to regulatory approval, and, in such event, no
            later than March 31, 2002;

      o     a governmental authority or a court order permanently prohibits the
            completion of the merger;

      o     either Dianon's or UroCor's stockholders do not give the required
            approvals necessary to complete the merger; or

      o     the board of directors of UroCor authorizes UroCor to enter into an
            agreement with a third party with respect to an acquisition proposal
            that the board determined is a superior proposal (as defined in the
            merger agreement)

                                      I-86

                                                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MERGER

      Dianon may terminate the merger agreement if any of the following occurs:

      o     UroCor's board of directors either fails to recommend the merger to
            its stockholders, changes its recommendation, or fails to call the
            UroCor special meeting to vote on the merger;

      o     UroCor or any of its directors, employees or agents breaches the
            "no-solicitation" provision of the merger agreement;

      o     UroCor's board of directors authorizes UroCor to accept an
            acquisition proposal, or, after an acquisition proposal is made
            public, UroCor's board fails to affirm its recommendation of the
            merger with Dianon as soon as practicable and no later than 3
            business days after requested by Dianon;

      o     A tender or exchange offer is commenced and the UroCor board fails
            to recommend against such offer; or

      o     UroCor breaches any of its representations, warranties or covenants
            contained in the merger agreement, resulting in its failure to
            satisfy one of the closing conditions to the merger, and, if
            curable, that breach remains uncured for 30 days.

      
UroCor may terminate the merger agreement if any of the following occurs:

      o     Dianon breaches any of its representations, warranties or covenants
            contained in the merger agreement, resulting in its failure to
            satisfy one of the closing conditions to the merger, and, if
            curable, that breach remains uncured for 30 days.

      
Termination Fees and Expenses Payable by UroCor.
UroCor has agreed to pay
Dianon a termination fee of $5,128,000 and up to $1,000,000 of Dianon's expenses
if one of the following occurs:

            o Dianon or UroCor terminates because the UroCor stockholder
      approval was not obtained and prior to the UroCor stockholders meeting any
      person shall have made or announced an intention to make an acquisition
      proposal with respect to UroCor;

            o if Dianon or UroCor terminate because UroCor enters into an
      agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal that the UroCor Board
      concludes is a superior proposal;

            o Dianon terminates the merger agreement because:

                  i.    the UroCor board fails to recommend the merger
                        agreement, withdraws or changes its recommendation or
                        fails to call the stockholder meeting;

                  ii.   
UroCor breaches the "no solicitation" clause in the
                        merger agreement;

                  iii.  
the UroCor board approves or recommends an acquisition
                        proposal or fails to affirm its recommendation of the
                        merger with Dianon;

                                      I-87

                                                        CHAPTER
ONE - THE MERGER

                  iv.   
the UroCor board fails to recommend against a tender
                        offer; or

                  v.    UroCor breaches the merger agreement and within 12
                        months enters into an agreement with a third party with
                        respect to an acquisition proposal; or

      o     Dianon terminates because any person consummates a tender offer or
            exchange offer for UroCor.

AMENDMENTS, EXTENSIONS AND WAIVERS

      
The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time, provided
that if the merger agreement is amendment after the stockholder meetings then

                             SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

      
The following tables include financial results actually achieved by Dianon
and UroCor ("historical" amounts) as well as results assuming that the companies
had been combined for the periods shown (the "pro forma combined" amounts) under
the purchase method of accounting.

      
The historical information is derived from:

      o     the audited financial statements of Dianon as of and for the years
            ended December 31, 1996 through December 31, 2000 and the unaudited
            financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31,
            2001 and March 31, 2000; and

      o     the audited financial statements of UroCor as of and for the years
            ended December 31, 1996 through December 31, 2000 and the unaudited
            financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31,
            2001 and March 31, 2000.

      
The pro forma information is derived from the Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements, appearing elsewhere herein, which
combine the historical consolidated financial statements of Dianon and UroCor
and give effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on March 31, 2001
for the balance sheet and on January 1, 2000 for the income statement when
presented for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The pro forma income statement
presented as of March 31, 2001 reflect effects of the merger if it had been
consummated on January 1, 2001.

      
You should not assume that Dianon and UroCor would have achieved the
combined pro forma results if they had actually been combined during the periods
shown.
The selected financial data included in this section should be read in
conjunction with the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of Dianon and
UroCor and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,
including the notes thereto, included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DIANON Systems, Inc. ("Dianon") and UroCor, Inc. ("UroCor") entered into an
agreement and plan of merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated June 28,
2001, whereby UroCor will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Dianon.
The Merger
Agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger each UroCor share
issued and outstanding will be converted into Dianon common stock at an exchange
ratio of .4064 if the Dianon stock price is less than or equal to $44.29.
If the
Dianon stock price is greater than $44.29, the exchange ratio will equal a
quotient, the numerator of which is $18.00 and the denominator of which is the
Dianon stock price.
Based on a Dianon closing price of $50.23 on July 27, 2001,
UroCor, shareholders would receive .3584 shares of Dianon's common stock for
each of their shares of UroCor's common stock.
The merger will be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting.
Under this method, the acquiring
company records the acquired assets less assumed liabilities at fair value.
Any
difference between the acquisition cost and the sum of the fair values of the
acquired company's identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.


Following is the unaudited pro forma purchase price and unaudited pro forma
purchase price allocation based on the UroCor unaudited March 31, 2001 balance
sheet and assumes the issuance of Dianon shares as of the July 27, 2001 closing
price.


The amount and components of the estimated pro forma purchase price along with
the preliminary allocation of such purchase price are as follows (in thousands,
except shares and share price):

Dianon shares to be issued                                            3,576,484
Closing price on July 27, 2001                                      $     50.23

                                           CHAPTER TWO - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

Merger related fees and expenses primarily consisting of SEC filing fees, fees
of investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, and financial printing
directly related to the transaction are estimated to be $12.3 million.

Integration related costs include severance of approximately 200 UroCor
employees currently estimated to be $6.2 million, of which $5.6 million will be
paid at the closing with the balance of $.6 million to be paid subsequent to the
consummation of the merger.


The final purchase price will be determined based on the actual value of the
Dianon shares and options issued as well as actual transaction costs and other
accruable costs.
The purchase price will be allocated to the assets purchased
and liabilities assumed based on their fair values.
Dianon has engaged a
nationally recognized accounting firm to assist in determining the fair values
of the assets and liabilities acquired.
This valuation will be completed after
the merger is consummated.


The final purchase price allocation will reflect any other assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, including pre-acquisition contingencies as appropriate.

Such pre-acquisition contingencies may include expenses relating to the UroCor
DOJ investigation, including without limitation, the administration of the
UroCor DOJ settlement (including compliance with the UroCor corporate integrity
agreement), any related governmental investigations or proceedings (including
the criminal investigation referenced in the UroCor corporate integrity
agreement) and any potential indemnification of legal and other fees and costs
for current and past directors, officers and employees of UroCor.
Dianon
currently estimates that these potential indemnification expenses could amount
to up to $6 million.


Subsequent to the consummation of the merger, Dianon will implement a plan to
integrate the UroCor business into Dianon.
This will result in the restructuring
of, among other items, UroCor's current staffing levels and billing systems.
As
a result, it is possible that certain accounts receivable will not be collected.

Dianon's management believes these amounts could be $3 to $5 million.
Any such
adjustment to the accounts receivable balances as a result of the merger and
integration activities will be charged to operations subsequent to the merger,
and, accordingly, no adjustment is reflected in the pro forma condensed combined
financial statements.


(1)   Represents cash used at closing for merger related expenses including
      transaction costs of $12.3 million and severance of $5.6 million discussed
      above.


(2)   Represents write-off of capitalized software primarily related to UroCor's
      billing system that will not be used once the merger takes place.


(3)   Represents goodwill and other intangibles recorded upon consummation of
      the transaction net of the elimination of UroCor intangibles.


(4)   Represents accrual for severance to be paid after closing ($.6 million),
      net of current tax benefit ($2.5 million) on total severance payments.

                                           CHAPTER TWO - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

(5)   Represents the net deferred tax liability related to $16 million of
      customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets offset by the
      deferred tax effect of the write-off of $5.8 million of UroCor intangible
      assets and $3.2 million of capitalized software.


(6)   Represents equity issued of $206.3 million to effect the transaction
      offset by the elimination of UroCor equity of $39.3 million.


(7)   Represents the amortization of the customer lists and other identifiable
      intangibles acquired in the transaction which, amortized over a useful
      life ranging from 7 to 15 years.
This amortization of $1.0 million and $.3
      million is offset by the elimination of UroCor intangible amortization
      expense of $.2 million and $.1 million for the year ended December 31,
      2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.


(8)   Represents tax effect of pro-forma adjustments, as applicable.


(9)   Represents the elimination of a non-recurring gain of $4.6 million for the
      three months ended March 31, 2001 attributable to the termination in
      February 2001 of UroCor's distribution agreement with the manufacturer of
      a therapeutic product previously distributed by UroCor.


(10)  Represents the elimination of a non-recurring charge of $10.3 million for
      the year ended December 31, 2000 for settlement costs and legal fees
      incurred pursuant to the tentative settlement with the Department of
      Justice discussed above.
